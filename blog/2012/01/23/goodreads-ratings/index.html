<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--czAH4cCqME/Tx5KxR4KxbI/AAAAAAAAAn0/cI6PcDeoEXI/s1600/goodreads.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--czAH4cCqME/Tx5KxR4KxbI/AAAAAAAAAn0/cI6PcDeoEXI/s1600/goodreads.jpg" /></a></div><br />I&#8217;ve been a member of it since 2008, but it wasn&#8217;t until recently that I found any affection for <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>, a social networking website based on readers and writers. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t been able to find many people to interact with on it; for me, the greatest value is simply in being able to keep a list of books that I&#8217;ve read, and how much I like them, based on a simple scale of 1 to 5 stars.<br /><br />A scale of 1 to 5 is pretty limited, but can still mean different things to everyone, which is why I like that Goodreads has a little dialog hover helpfully over the stars when you&#8217;re judging them. &nbsp;1 star, it says, stands for <i>I&nbsp;didn&#8217;t like it.</i>&nbsp; 2, for <i>It was OK. &nbsp;</i>3: <i>I liked it.</i>&nbsp; 4: <i>I really liked it.</i>&nbsp; And 5: <i>It was amazing.</i><br /><br />My personal rating system goes like this:<br /><br /><ul><li>1 &#8211; <i>I didn&#8217;t like it.</i> &nbsp;This book made me ill. &nbsp;Reading it may have caused my opinion of humanity to degrade. &nbsp;I would grimace when remembering it, and anti-recommend it, fiercely. &nbsp;Examples: <i>Wild Animus, Bloodborn, Hot Gimmick S.</i></li><li>2 &#8211; <i>It was okay.</i> &nbsp;I wouldn&#8217;t read it again or recommend it, but there was some slight redeeming quality about it, even if it was just that it featured a fetish motif (ex. shapeshifters). &nbsp;Examples: <i>Other, Abandoned, Dead Until Dark.</i></li><li>3 &#8211; <i>I liked</i>&nbsp;<i>it.</i>&nbsp; Reserved for books which kept me turning pages, but in the end were really just so-so. &nbsp;Examples: <i>Pants on Fire, A Lion Among Men, The Eye of the World.</i></li><li>4 &#8211; <i>I really liked it.</i>&nbsp; Given to books which kept me hungry for more, and<i>&nbsp;</i>were well-written, and had me sitting back dazed for a little after finishing.&nbsp;Examples:&nbsp;<i>Delirium, Wintergirls, The Alchemist.</i></li><li>5 &#8211; <i>It was amazing. </i>&nbsp;My label for books that <i>changed my life,</i>&nbsp;whether in terms of writing style, basic habits, or perceptions of morality/reality/x-ality. &nbsp;Examples being: <i>The Time-Traveler&#8217;s Wife, Perdido Street Station, The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma.</i></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>I read a quote somewhere I can&#8217;t find now; the point of it was that it is unproductive to read a book and then wonder to yourself whether you liked it or not. &nbsp;My takeaway from the idea was that judgment is less productive than analysis &#8211; that is, it&#8217;s infinitely better to say, <i>&#8220;I liked X for Y reasons,&#8221;</i>&nbsp;both for yourself and for the writer as well, since the writer is given the opportunity to improve. &nbsp;But as Goodreads is a social network not just for readers but for writers (with little qualifying labels next to their names), I hesitate at leaving qualitative feedback. &nbsp;Writers are real! &nbsp;And they have feelings! &nbsp;I don&#8217;t want to hurt those. &nbsp;Plus, popular books often have a multitude of reviews praising this or decrying that; I can&#8217;t see myself adding anything of value to the discussions, especially when ratings in these cases have usually fallen into an equilibrium rating of 4 or so.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll finish with a quote from <i>A Room of One&#8217;s Own</i>&nbsp;by Virginia Woolf:</div><blockquote>At any rate, where books are concerned, it is notoriously difficult to fix labels of merit in such a way that they do not come off.  Are not reviews of current literature a perpetual illustration of the difficulty of judgment?  &#8220;This great book,&#8221; &#8220;this worthless book,&#8221; the same book is called by both names.  Praise and blame alike mean nothing.  No, delightful as the pastime of measuring may be, it is the most futile of all occupations, and to submit to the decrees of the measurers the most servile of attitudes.  So long as you write what you wish to write, that is all that matters; and whether it matters for ages or only for hours, nobody can say.</blockquote></div>
