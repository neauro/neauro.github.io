The inside of this quarter's edition is unexpectedly lovely. To check it out, you'll have to get it yourself, since I've tried and failed and subsequently quit attempting to make myself take pictures and upload them for this post.&nbsp;It's available on campus and neighboring book-related businesses until supplies run out. My particular story can also be accessed <a href="http://neauro.com/storything/golemist.html">here</a>, because I wanted some content to practice styling, and playing around with for lightweight parallaxing.<br /><br />[ spoilers ]<br /><br />Inspiration didn't quite strike me for any of the themes last year, but it did for this particular theme, "Homeland." I was feverishly thinking of ways to riff off the idea of <em>returning home</em> when I was shuffling my white/green tokens deck, and then looked down into my hand and saw Wayfaring Temple.<br /><br /><em>Oh my gosh</em>, I thought, <em>what if your home returns to YOU?</em><br /><em><br /></em>I used <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/">SUPERSCROLLORAMA</a>&nbsp;for the sillyness at the end.</div>

Apparently a ton of people submitted short stories for this quarter's "Legacy" theme, and most of those stories were right on the border of 3,000 words.  As AU's size is apparently limited by how many pages the editors can physically staple together, they could only accept 6 submissions.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AWre2xlzwP4/Te2Z3EgpgOI/AAAAAAAAAPk/B4I-P3ztHX4/s1600/au_iii_cover.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AWre2xlzwP4/Te2Z3EgpgOI/AAAAAAAAAPk/B4I-P3ztHX4/s320/au_iii_cover.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">cover by katherine tung, once more</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My submission is a short story titled <em>Her Will</em>, and you can find <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/post/6186670471/her-will">the full thing here</a>.<br /><br />When I heard about the theme, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy">searched Wikipedia</a> and came to the conclusion that something playing off an inheritance or will would be a good idea.  I also thought that it might be neat if a "will" were more literal -- that is, that someone who died in some alternate universe would be able to possess some person to carry out a last task.  Eventually this idea was trashed, but, meh.  I may come back to it again.<br /><br />I think that it's fair to say I've never written short stories before AU; I just never really had the idea for it, nor the urge.  I always found it hard to squeeze all my ideas into one short story.  But I've discovered that writing short stories are surprisingly, uniquely fun -- there's something about it that's almost like design.  There has to be a meaning to every word, every sentence.  For this story, I went beginning to end multiple times trying to cut out everything I couldn't immediately justify, and strengthening everything else that was left.  Though I would call the story far from perfect (when does any story ever reach that point?), even now I can't think of one sentence that I would feel comfortable removing.  I feared that some of the sentences would start to sound blunt and lifeless, but hopefully that's not the case in the final draft.<br /><br />I'm going to miss AU!  Hopefully it will be taken up by new people next year, and I'll be able to contribute since I'll still be a UW (Master's) student.</div>

It's now a now-two-issues old literary journal of speculative fiction on UW.  Some of the submissions were really gorgeous, so I was really happy that <a href="http://neauro.com/content/writing/thecrash/writing.php">my (somewhat silly) submission</a> was also featured.<br /><br />I got my issue last night at the release party.  I didn't stay for the sci-fi Jeopardy game afterward (as I never really did get into the Star Wars/Star Trek/Dr. Who nerd-dom), but it was really nice to see that handful of people gather and be so excited about this little quarterly journal.  It's always cool to think that AU was just started up by the whim of three girls.  <span class="shh">If you want something, go get it!</span><br /><br />Haha!  And I just discovered this poem at the end of the issue, which contains the last word of every submission in the journal:<br /><br /><em>Sigh lost angels,<br />rewind the night.<br />Jefferson cares<br />to follow lines of<br />sons.</em></div>
