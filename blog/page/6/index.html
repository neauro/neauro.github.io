To check it out, you&#8217;ll have to get it yourself, since I&#8217;ve tried and failed and subsequently quit attempting to make myself take pictures and upload them for this post.&nbsp;It&#8217;s available on campus and neighboring book-related businesses until supplies run out. My particular story can also be accessed <a href="http://neauro.com/storything/golemist.html">here</a>, because I wanted some content to practice styling, and playing around with for lightweight parallaxing.<br /><br />[ spoilers ]<br /><br />Inspiration didn&#8217;t quite strike me for any of the themes last year, but it did for this particular theme, &#8220;Homeland.&#8221; I was feverishly thinking of ways to riff off the idea of <em>returning home</em> when I was shuffling my white/green tokens deck, and then looked down into my hand and saw Wayfaring Temple.<br /><br /><em>Oh my gosh</em>, I thought, <em>what if your home returns to YOU?</em><br /><em><br /></em>I used <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/">SUPERSCROLLORAMA</a>&nbsp;for the sillyness at the end.</div>

Fleece! Felt! The tree came out a little lopsided but I think it was good for a first try. I intended for it to have more of a chullo-shape but in the end confused myself and ended up just going back to the familiar rectangular shape the yields triangle ears.<br /><br />I have a lot more brown and white fleece left which I hope to use for future corgi- or shiba-related endeavors!</div>

By the end of the film, Jack&#8217;s character also undergoes a transformation to solve his problem:&nbsp;<i>My purpose is to share my love of &#8220;fun&#8221; with children, and now they believe in me. </i>In contrast, Ralph&#8217;s &#8220;transformation&#8221; seemed weak and frustrating to me personally; at the beginning he is a character who longs for recognition and acceptance, and at the end becomes happy because he gets&#8230;recognition and acceptance. It&#8217;s just a little boring. It&#8217;s like a story about someone who says, &#8220;You know what I would like? $5.&#8221; And then that someone meets a princess who gives him $5. The end!</li><li><b>The other primary characters interacted with Jack in ways that helped him with his transformation.</b>&nbsp;Santa teaches Jack the idea of a &#8220;center,&#8221; or something that Jack is <i>all about,</i>&nbsp;which Jack realizes he doesn&#8217;t know. Tooth teaches Jack that he was someone before he was Jack Frost, and later is an example of how the Guardians have become misaligned with their previous love of caring for children. Bunny is a sort of litmus test for Jack&#8217;s familiarity with the Guardians, and the Sandman&#8217;s death was what triggered Jack&#8217;s supercoldblizzard power (or whatever). The antagonist, Pitch, was also a foil for Jack, representing the &#8220;bad side&#8221; of wanting to be seen and recognized so badly that you would want children to fear you. In contrast, the interactions between Ralph and characters like Felix and <strike>Jane Lynch</strike> Sergeant Tamora were pretty shallow, and after the Hero&#8217;s Duty part of the movie, whenever you saw Tamora it was really just for romantic comedy fluff that had nothing to do with the movie&#8217;s title character.</li><li><b>The Tooth Fairy had her own not-man-related things going on, </b>including but not limited to control of whatever the fairy army is called and a love of gummy, bloody teeth that was amusingly ridiculous. Compare to the Sergeant, whose motivation is hate for the bug-things because they killed her husband (in her fake memories). It&#8217;s true that Tooth was fangirly about Jack&#8217;s teeth and all of her fairy minions were swooning over Jack&#8217;s hoarfrost bangs but I&#8217;ll take what I can get.</li><li><b>No romance! </b>(Beyond that too-long hug at the end between Tooth and Jack?)&nbsp;Just, thank you for not stuffing that into the movie, especially since it was already bursting its seams with all the fast-paced kingdom-touring and gold particle effects. (On a related note, #rainbowsnowcone and #frostbite seem to be what the shippers are calling Frost/Tooth.)</li></ul><br />There were a couple plot holes in the movie that bothered me somewhat (Why did they only need to round up teeth for one night to save Tooth? After everyone fell asleep in Jamie&#8217;s room, why were they suddenly in the sleigh, still-sleeping, later?) but I have been reading <i>Wired for Story</i>&nbsp;by Lisa Cron recently, and one of its tenets is that good stories are not about what just events that happen, but about the changes that happen in their characters. I&#8217;m not ready to forgive all plot holes for this reason, but it does give me a new lens into what details are the most important in story. In the case of these two movies, Jack&#8217;s change from the invisible, meaningless delinquent into someone that uses his fun for good is what made him so much more compelling to me, and enjoyable to watch as well.</div>

Potato chips are my snack of choice. I saw this book and thought, <i>Wow, that is a great-looking bag, and honestly, it&#8217;s got all the ingredients I really appreciate in a bag of chips.</i> I finished it in a single day, and then just felt like&#8230;<i>Well&#8230;that&#8217;s it, I guess. </i>Time to look for something else to eat.<br /><br />(This, by the way, brings the number of dishes at my book-banquet up to at least three, the first items being <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/10/legend-marie-lu.html">cheesecake</a> and <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/12/blind-willow-sleeping-woman-haruki.html">green tea pudding</a>.)<br /><br />I thought the world was interesting, but I felt that its &#8220;grim&#8221; aspects were there to decorate the space of the story, rather than used to interact with it.&nbsp;<strike>Ravnica</strike>&nbsp;Ravka has supposedly rampant poverty, but no one really faces it.&nbsp;Ravka has been war-torn for hundreds of years, but there&#8217;s no real evidence of it except for the strong militia, who are shown not fighting battles, but escorting people across &#8220;the Unsea,&#8221; and fetching things for a dark dude called (surprise) the Darkling.<br /><br />It&#8217;s kind of hard for me to bring up more critique about the characters in this story, mostly because I care so little about them. The Darkling and the main character Alina had some clever flirty dialogue, I guess. Mal seemed like a non-problematic male character, hurray. All the girls in the story seemed pretty flat. There&#8217;s a super-talented bully, two friendly gossipers that Alina hangs out with but doesn&#8217;t like, and a girl who can wield magical cosmetics who is jealously possessed by the Queen and alluded at some point to have been used for sex by the King. (On a side note, Bardugo seems to work as a makeup artist in Hollywood, so the presence of a makeup-y character is pretty cute.)<br /><br />The writing fell really flat for me, maybe because I&#8217;d just come away from <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/12/blind-willow-sleeping-woman-haruki.html">Haruki Murakami</a>. It was effective and easy and I raced through it, but it wasn&#8217;t especially poignant. I felt like a good chunk of it was spent just describing the simple reds and blues and blacks of the coats people were wearing, or the elaborate carvings on the walls of the palaces Alina is in. (By the way, because Ravka is separated from its &#8220;True Sea&#8221; by &#8220;the Unsea,&#8221; I was dying for Alina to see mother-of-pearl inlay on the palace walls and be like, <i>What the fuck, that stuff is awesome.</i>&nbsp;Unfortunately, no such drama occurred.)<br /><br />The Russian premise was interesting, but I was disappointed to learn through Goodreads reviews (like <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/283956289">this one</a>) that the Russian language was often misused and incorrect. Naming the magical miliary &#8220;Grisha&#8221; is the Russian equivalent of naming it &#8220;Bill&#8221; in English. <a href="http://ykmreviews.blogspot.com/2012/08/071-stormdancer-by-jay-kristoff.html">Appropriation in other young adult novels</a> bothers me, and this one is no exception.<br /><br />Well&#8230;that&#8217;s it, I guess.</div>

I&#8217;ve never read Murakami&#8217;s short stories before, but enjoyed these ones, mostly because reading novels by Murakami for me is like falling into a dark, magical pit, and upon landing at the bottom you are left winded, stranded, and a little bit at loss but convinced that you saw sparkling things on the way down so it was all pretty cool overall.<br /><br />In contrast, reading each short story here was like eating green tea pudding. Your mouth, meeting the first bite, finds it bitter and creamy and bewildering; meeting the second, acclimates, and thinks, <i>Oh wow, okay, whoa, this is great</i>; and then you&#8217;re opening your mouth for the next mouthful and there&#8217;s nothing but spoon.<br /><br /><i>Wait! But &#8211; what &#8211;?</i><br /><i><br /></i>I have no idea. But those first two bites were pretty good.</div>

All you need is a container div, and inside that two more divs: one for the area above the fold (the &#8220;landing&#8221;), and one for your &#8220;main&#8221; information.<br /><br />The CSS looks like:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:js">html,body {<br />margin:0px auto;<br />height:100%;<br />}<br /><br />div#container {<br />min-width:100%;<br />height:100%;<br />}<br /><br />div#landing {<br />width:100%;<br />height:100%;<br />background: #5d5d5d url("../images/header_bg.jpg") center center no-repeat;<br />background-size:cover;<br />}<br /><br />div#main {<br />background-color:#eeeee2;<br />}<br /></pre><br />And the HTML should be like:<br /><pre class="brush:xml">&lt;body&gt;<br /><div id="container">&nbsp;<br /><div id="landing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top part of page<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;<br /><div id="main">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rest of the page<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div>&lt;/body&gt;<br /></pre><br />How exciting.</div>

The Sisterhood always knows best. The Guardians will protect and serve. The Unconsecrated will never relent. And you must always mind the fence that surrounds the village; the fence that protects the village from the Forest of Hands and Teeth. But, slowly, Mary’s truths are failing her. She’s learning things she never wanted to know about the Sisterhood and its secrets, and the Guardians and their power, and about the Unconsecrated and their relentlessness. When the fence is breached and her world is thrown into chaos, she must choose between her village and her future—between the one she loves and the one who loves her. And she must face the truth about the Forest of Hands and Teeth. Could there be life outside a world surrounded in so much death?</em></blockquote><br />I just finished reading The Forest of Hands and Teeth, which was okay. The premise was intriguing and I was looking forward to an engagement with The Whole Zombie Thing that didn&#8217;t have guns blazing. Overall the book&#8217;s mood is super introspective, with the protagonist Mary aching for the ocean, the concept of which has been handed down to her from her mother. Eventually, Mary sees the ocean in a photo and can describe it as having &#8220;whitecaps&#8221; despite possibly never seeing anything with whitecaps before?<br /><br />I wasn&#8217;t really invested in any of the characters. There are four &#8220;main&#8221; ones, all of whom are childhood friends: Mary, Cass, and Travis and Harry, who are brothers. Mary and Travis have a mutual love, and Harry loves Mary for some reason and gets betrothed to her, and Cass loves Harry for a reason but is betrothed to Travis, and stays betrothed to Travis even when she falls in love with Harry.<br /><br />&#8220;But we can make this work,&#8221; Mary says when she realizes this, at which point Cass hisses something like, &#8220;No! Harry chose you and I want Harry to be happy so I will go with his will! And Travis won&#8217;t make Harry sad either by taking you away from him, so there!&#8221;<br /><br />(Why do they all care about what Harry wants so much? I&#8217;m not sure.) <br /><br />The heights of emotional dialogue in the book involve characters getting flustered about whether or not Mary cares about them, and whether or not they are her #1 motivation (which, spoilers, is The Ocean).<br /><br />The book moves fast and feels cramped at times. In two pages Mary and Travis have their first mind-blowing kiss AND marvel in horror at the Fast Zombie Who Wears a Noticeably Red Vest (who I can only ever visualize as a cross between <a href="http://left4dead.wikia.com/wiki/The_Witch">a Witch</a> and <a href="http://gointothestory.blcklst.com/2012/03/great-character-the-little-girl-in-red-schindlers-list.html">that girl from <em>Schindler&#8217;s List</em></a>).<br /><br />Overall I wish there was more time to get settled into what daily life was like for these characters, surrounded by the undead. Mary spends a lot of time thinking about how awful it is to be surrounded by death but I would have liked to be struck with details about it &#8211; the way as children they might have played chicken out of the reach of desperate, broken fingers &#8211; more about their childhood, actually, would have made them bright and real, more than just a description like &#8220;we have always been friends.&#8221; I would have wanted to see what Harry excelled at if not shooting arrows, why Travis was lured by Mary&#8217;s stories to also long for Ocean-ness, how Cass&#8217;s &#8220;sunshine&#8221; was anything more than her bright hair or a weird smell her flesh gave off.<br /><br />Something else about this book that gave me a niggling feeling was how much time Mary spent bemoaning how bad her life was surrounded by &#8220;so much death.&#8221; The pre-zombie days seem far back away from her time &#8211; so far enough back that I don&#8217;t quite buy how much she wants them. How can she miss something she never really had? Despite being told a lot about The Good Old Days through various mediums, I personally can&#8217;t find myself really aching for them, despite the intimidating problems we have now, like horrendous pollution, wealth disparity, Facebook-derived social anxiety, and so on.<br /><br />I still have enough interest in the idea of how hope can perservere in such a world that I&#8217;m tempted to pick up the next book.</div>

(&#8220;Real&#8221; being my way of distinguishing this sorbet from my actual first sorbet-making experience, in which I fastidiously measured out a cup of pineapple juice into a sorbet mixture, and then poured into the ice cream maker not this mixture, but the leftover pineapple juice. Whoops.)<br /><br />I really adore ice cream and gave an ice cream maker to my mother last Christmas, which she gave back to me after admitting she&#8217;d probably never use it. Molly Moon&#8217;s book &#8211; with its color, environmentally friendly morals, and cheering that you can really do it, it&#8217;s easy! &#8211; is what really got me interested in trying to make ice cream. But, since it was on hold at the library, I found a different book to use for initial experiments.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OyXLb-jT3RU/ULg8XgnBOOI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/P9IThybKY2E/s1600/recipe-week-ice-cream-52-easy-recipes-for-sally-sampson-paperback-cover-art.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OyXLb-jT3RU/ULg8XgnBOOI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/P9IThybKY2E/s1600/recipe-week-ice-cream-52-easy-recipes-for-sally-sampson-paperback-cover-art.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this one!

This is my source for the sorbet above, which is really just coconut milk, pineapple juice, and orange juice, with a little bit of cinnamon on top because it seemed like it needed something for the photo.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t realize making ice cream was so easy. The ice cream maker, a contraption I always regarded as impermeably mysterious for some reason, is in fact just a sort of canister with frozen stuff in it, in which you&#8217;re supposed to whip up your mixture such that it freezes along the sides and gets filled with air in the process. Most ice cream recipes seem like some variation of &#8220;Put cream and other things into a saucepan, bring it to a simmer, let it cool, then throw it in an ice cream maker.&#8221;<br /><br />Here&#8217;s to a cool future.</div>

The popularity&nbsp;of <em>Skyfall</em> didn&#8217;t mean that <em>Wreck-It&nbsp;</em><em>Ralph</em> had open seats, however, so Andou and I&nbsp;opted to see the still-open 3D movie.<br /><br />[spoilers]<br /><br />It was super beautiful, and all the video game&nbsp;references at the beginning were pretty delightful,&nbsp;yet not, in my opinion, cheesy and overwhelming. It&nbsp;was fun to hear people practically scream at the&nbsp;Metal Gear Solid reference, though my personal&nbsp;favorite was a shot of Sonic blinking and losing his&nbsp;rings after being hit by that spaceship thing :D<br /><br />Overall I was really impressed by the clarity of the&nbsp;story, especially given the risk of confusion&nbsp;resulting from relying on too much video game&nbsp;esoterica or fanservice. Certain words and certain&nbsp;settings threw their weight into the plot&#8217;s goings-on, and it was nice to feel that the things&nbsp;you saw were, for the most part, not just shiny&nbsp;fluff, but would actually deliver on some interesting and relevant happening.<br /><br />One thing that I just couldn&#8217;t stand was the&nbsp;character Vanellope.&nbsp;I couldn&#8217;t muster up sympathy for her at all. @__@  I&nbsp;guess the idea is that her immaturity, selfishness,&nbsp;and spontaneity are okay because she&#8217;s a child and&nbsp;she has enormous caramel apple-colored eyes? As a&nbsp;character who seems solely there to be &#8220;adorable&#8221; and&nbsp;act as a motivation for the protagonist, I felt&nbsp;mixed&#8230;and had a lot of weird feelings about the&nbsp;character interactions in general.<br /><br />On one hand, it&#8217;s nice that Ralph finally finds&nbsp;&#8220;goodness&#8221; not in the accumulation of shiny extrinsic things&nbsp;(like that &#8220;Hero&#8221; medal), but rather in helping&nbsp;others (specifically, Vanellope). On the other hand,&nbsp;the whole &#8220;I&#8217;m Ralph and just seeing Vanellope be&nbsp;happy is what I need to be happy :&#8217;)&#8221; had a heteronormative tinge &#8211; <em>Helping children be&nbsp;</em><em>happy is the most important thing in the world!&nbsp;</em>&#8211; and ultimately I feel like I wish Ralph had come&nbsp;to learn more about what he does personally that make&nbsp;him uniquely happy, rather than having his newfound&nbsp;happiness hinge so much on helping a specific person realize their aspirations. I mean, the movie is called <em>Wreck-It <strong>Ralph</strong></em>, right?<br /><br />The inevitable marriage between the only other female main character and the only other male main character was also hugely wince-inducing, just because it seemed so&#8230;forced&#8230;and inevitable. (Ack! I wince just thinking about it!)<br /><br />Anyway, Vanellope seems unexpectedly popular on Tumblr, so I&#8217;m still musing on the reasons why I don&#8217;t like her. Maybe I missed something&#8230;</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So I found a gifset of Sword Art Online on Tumblr and decided that I wanted to watch it, because the art is pretty and also because the characters looked familiar, probably because Sword Art Online is one of the light novels I bought (and subsequently lost) some time ago.  <br /><br />Well, no matter!<br /><br />Sword Art Online (SAO) details the adventures of Kirito, who is one of ten thousand players trapped in the newly-released &#8220;virtual reality&#8221; MMORPG of the same name. The creator of SAO, who turns out to be some kind of eccentric psychopath, removes the &#8220;Log Out&#8221; button on the first day of open play and announces that everyone will have to reach and defeat Floor 100 in order to return back to the Real World. In the meantime, if you die in the game, you die in real life.<br /><br />I was excited because Kirito has bangs (my favorite ridiculous anime hair affectation) and spends the opening looking Dark and Tormented (my favorite ridiculous anime stereotype). Additionally, the &#8220;main&#8221; female character, Asuna, appears in the opening running around and doing things.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SVwGKD2OF2Y/UKRq787wvXI/AAAAAAAACyY/FAquBkYgszk/s1600/sao.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="387" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SVwGKD2OF2Y/UKRq787wvXI/AAAAAAAACyY/FAquBkYgszk/s640/sao.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">go, asuna, go! clear that low bar of agency!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />[spoilers ahead]<br /><br />Inevitably this first season was full of the same old tired female character stereotypes/storylines/actions, including but not limited to:<br /><br /><ul><li>female characters that basically act as pretty receptacles and mirrors for Kirito&#8217;s feelings, for example:</li><ul><li>Silica, Dragon Tamer Girl: who appeared for one episode to be Kirito&#8217;s &#8220;little sister,&#8221; with bonus panicked upskirts</li><li>Lisbeth, Smith Girl: who appeared for one episode to be a love interest that is irrelevant after the one episode</li></ul><li>male characters not caring that female characters don&#8217;t like them or want to be near them, for example:</li><ul><li>That one guy refuses to stop being Asuna&#8217;s escort, and says he&#8217;ll only leave her alone if Kirito wins against him a duel (what)</li><li>The leader of Asuna&#8217;s guild, who, when Asuna tells him she wants to leave the guild, says she can only leave if Kirito wins against him in a duel (what)</li></ul><li>There&#8217;s also a sub-plot that involves a woman who is murdered by her husband because, in the life-threatening situation of Sword Art Online, she stopped being &#8220;cute and obedient&#8221; and became instead a &#8220;lively and active&#8221; guild leader&#8230;<em>what?</em> It&#8217;s obvious that this particular guy character is horrible, but I guess I&#8217;m bewildered by this story, which seemed to come out of nowhere, and didn&#8217;t really serve to teach any characters about anything. Maybe if at the end Kirito had thought something like, <i>Wow, this really makes me appreciate Asuna&#8217;s fighting skill more</i>&#8230;?</li></ul><br />The things that I <em>did</em> enjoy about this anime were the little game-related details, which take on a &#8220;private joke&#8221; feeling that I think was delightful and <em>not</em> uncomfortably blatant with fanfare and winking (&#8220;Hey! That was a game reference! Get it? Eh? <em>Ehhhh</em>?&#8221;). Characters gossip about other characters who have legendary status because their &#8220;HP bar has never fallen to yellow.&#8221; At some point Kirito hits a wall in anger and the wall flashes with a notification &#8211; <code>IMMORTAL OBJECT</code> &#8211; indicating that it&#8217;s inanimate and&nbsp;indestructible&nbsp; Best part: this little moment turns out to have plot significance later. Whoa! I <em>really</em> appreciate the meaningful subtlety.<br /><br />It&#8217;s also fun to view what happens to characters as they become trapped in the digital world, though I wish it were explored more, perhaps in lieu of unnecessary female character fanservice. Some people commit suicide; some dedicate themselves to fighting on &#8220;the front lines&#8221; to free everyone; some people become merchants and smiths to support the fighters. One old man, thinking that he&#8217;d never get his real-life job back anyway, decides that he&#8217;ll perfect in-game fishing.<br /><br />Inevitably Kirito and Asuna fall into a relationship, an unexpectedly intense and serious romance that involves them getting married (in-game) and living together in a cabin in the woods (on the game&#8217;s Floor 22) and eventually meeting a girl that they &#8220;adopt&#8221; as their daughter (who later turns out to be a game process AI). Something that&#8217;s refreshing about their relationship is the trust they have in each other &#8211; Kirito&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;hangs behind while Asuna fights, and at one point just smiles when someone tries to warn him to get his wife out of the way of a giant attacking fish. Though they were rarer than the opposite, I appreciated the parts where Kirito gave Asuna a place to stand on her own and defend and be appreciated for her actions and thoughts and talents, which weren&#8217;t all Kirito-centered (for example, her&nbsp;experimentation&nbsp;with cooking and seeing which mixture of in-game loots and essences could make real-world flavors like soy sauce).<br /><br />Given the intensity of their dedication to each other (Kirito declares to Asuna that his entire self belongs to her; Asuna says that if Kirito dies, she&#8217;ll commit suicide), it&#8217;s uncomfortable and bewildering why the second season of SAO, which is still on-going, keeps pushing this love triangle forward between Kirito and his sister-who-is-actually-his-cousin. I mean, this isn&#8217;t going to pan out, right? Is this just an excuse to keep having unrequited romantic (slash incestuous and forbidden) tension in the show to keep people watching? Is devoted love so boring? After all that the two characters have been through together, and after the show gives you so much reason to invest in the semi-doomed lovebank of Kirito/Asuna, it&#8217;s hard to see this extra, new girl as anything but annoying fan service. <br /><br />Something else a little depressing is the impending descent of Asuna into a caged bird that doesn&#8217;t do much but stare forlornly into space whenever her captor, a despised fiancé in a real-world arranged marriage who is keeping her unconscious and trapped in a new MMORPG, comes to threaten her warmly with sexual assault or erasure of her memories. In the most recent episode, Asuna sneakily watched him unlock the door to her cage, which made me assume hopefully that she would try to escape on her own. Unfortunately, she just collapsed on her knees and cried, &#8220;Save me, Kirito!&#8221;<br /><br />It&#8217;s not that I blame her for her circumstances or think that she could fight her way out of it if she wanted&#8230;I just don&#8217;t want her to become a full-on damsel in distress. :(<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LxyJxHtHaZ4/UKRswdDNWJI/AAAAAAAACyg/8JOOm1RLdCk/s1600/sao2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="366" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LxyJxHtHaZ4/UKRswdDNWJI/AAAAAAAACyg/8JOOm1RLdCk/s640/sao2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">low bar of agency: not cleared (<a href="http://kimmygawa.tumblr.com/post/34445253622/weird-guy-that-smell-asunas-hair-made-her-cry">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Having met the end of the anime that&#8217;s presently out, I&#8217;ve been devouring the light novels, where fanservice-y upskirts are not as prominent and where Asuna is more of an active character during the &#8220;fairy&#8221; arc, escaping and fighting and doing what she can. As a series the whole thing is&nbsp;<i>really </i>fun to watch &#8211; it&#8217;s&nbsp;beautiful, and really stretches, embroiders, and <i>uses</i> its theme of video game worlds and realities.</div>

Asuna Yuuki is a heroine and the partner of Kirito in the Sword Art Online series. Her original avatar in <a href="http://www.cosplayfield.com/sword-art-online-alo-c-545_550.html" rel="nofollow">ALfheim Online</a>, was as Fairy Queen, Titania. She wore a white outfit, with a white long skirt, tube top showing her belly, along with a red ribbon that goes around the top part of her top that comes together to make a bow. She goes barefoot, and wears a white strip around her ankles! This <a href="http://www.cosplayfield.com/sao-alfheim-online-asuna-yuuki-cosplay-costume-p-523.html" rel="nofollow">Asuna Yuuki cosplay costume</a> looks like a long dress, and this is why I love it very much!</div>
