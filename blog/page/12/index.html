Now that it&#8217;s summer and I&#8217;ve come to rely more on my Orca Card instead of my beloved (yet inactive) student bus pass, a couple things become apparent:<br /><br /><ol><li><b>I really wish I knew when my transfers ended. </b>I don&#8217;t even remember how long transfers are supposed to last. Two hours? Three? When you pay in cash, the bus driver hands you a little piece of paper which can be used as fare for your next bus ride, as long as you&#8217;re fairly within time limits. With Orca, your transfer is invisible, and strict &#8211; are you leaving the bus two minutes after your fare is up, because of traffic or because the bus itself is late? Too bad, you&#8217;re paying the fare again. (This also gets frustrating when you board a bus that&#8217;s &#8220;Pay as you leave&#8221; &#8211; because even if you got on the bus within the time limit, what if you disembark too late?)</li><li><b>I really wish I knew how much money I had on my card as soon as I looked at it. </b>In my mind I imagine a little E-ink box that would happily display your available funds, in a futuristic, perfect society. To be fair, the card reader does tell you what your card&#8217;s remaining balance is once you swipe, but I find myself squinting at the small, gray-on-gray display every time I pass by. And, it would also be nice if this card reader could tell you things like, &#8220;Hey, your transfer will be up at 4:15pm!&#8221;</li></ol><div><br /></div><div>Not knowing when your transfers end can also be problematic for low-income users; as a professor in the HCDE department at UW <a href="http://bethkolko.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/how-technology-encodes-values/">points out</a>&nbsp;from a student dissertation, &#8220;Basically, you board the bus and swipe your card. If you’re inside the allotted transit time, nothing is deducted from your card. If not, the full fare comes off your card. And for some people, that might have been their way to work tomorrow. And that’s it for their cash this week.&#8221;</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I spent the week of the Fourth of July visiting Hawai&#8217;i for the first time. We went to the third-largest island, O&#8217;ahu, a.k.a &#8220;The Gathering Place,&#8221; which is the island which has Hawai&#8217;i&#8217;s capital, Honolulu. Our driver from the airport described&nbsp;Honolulu&nbsp;(&#8220;place of shelter&#8221;) as being named for the fact that the surrounding mountains shield it from bad weather.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AYSJHDHXVR8/UBGx4mqJN9I/AAAAAAAAByk/Rgur-z3m9Qk/s1600/Oahu_(1).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AYSJHDHXVR8/UBGx4mqJN9I/AAAAAAAAByk/Rgur-z3m9Qk/s1600/Oahu_(1).jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">o&#8217;ahu (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oahu">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><a href="http://www.speedishuttle.com/pickup">SpeediShuttle</a>, which has a partnership with the airport, did a great job of taking us to the Seaside Hotel with a minimum of stress despite parades clotting up downtown Honolulu. We ended up paying around $50 for a round-trip, with the promise that we could call their 24-hour hotline at any time and get picked up and taken back to the airport when we needed to catch our departing flight. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend paying in advance for the returning trip to the airport, because no one came to our 5am pickup or picked up the phone, and an hour and a half before our departure time we resorted to taking a cab back to HNL, which cost an extra $40. :( <b>Edit</b>: <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/speedishuttle-update.html">A SpeediShuttle update</a>.<br /><br />We stayed at the Seaside Hotel, which is one of the more modest places in Waikiki, but still well within reach of buslines and tourist fervor. Some online reviews indicated that it used to be &#8220;private&#8221; and reserved for airline employees. You can rent beach towels for the day, swim on a small rooftop pool, and lie on the bed wondering in vain why Discovery Channel broadcasts so many &#8220;[Storage/Property/X] Wars&#8221; shows nowadays. There was free Wi-Fi but we were never able to really connect to it successfully, and relied on the lobby computers for bus schedules instead. (To be honest, it was nice to be on a forced Internet break.)<br /><br />Something that our SpeediShuttle driver recommended we check out was a magazine called <i>101 Things to Do: Oahu, </i>which turned out to be a pretty good guide-slash-advertising booklet. This and other magazines can be picked up for free on most street corners, and contain coupons!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pCDMlZcsGHM/UBGy9wyDYUI/AAAAAAAABys/JP1iu7KtW_s/s1600/mag_oahu.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pCDMlZcsGHM/UBGy9wyDYUI/AAAAAAAABys/JP1iu7KtW_s/s1600/mag_oahu.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">101 Things to Do: Oahu (<a href="http://www.101thingstodo.com/oahu/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><b>Monday</b><br />The first thing we did was go to Hanauma (&#8220;ha-now-ma&#8221;) Bay&nbsp;Nature Preserve, which is essentially a really gorgeous bay historically used by Hawaiian royalty as their private fishing grounds.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nLxdMRmD1Go/UBK3NeXNEKI/AAAAAAAAB1Q/B5OjmJaBfCA/s1600/hanauma.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="194" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nLxdMRmD1Go/UBK3NeXNEKI/AAAAAAAAB1Q/B5OjmJaBfCA/s640/hanauma.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">iphone photos stitched together with <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">hugin</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Admission fee is $7.50. The coolest thing to do here is snorkel; the water is warm and colorful fish dart around pecking at the rocks. (Apparently turtles, sharks, and jellyfish sometimes drift through as well; and we definitely saw at least one pufferfish that had us flailing back to the shore in noob-like panic, haha.) You can rent snorkeling sets (goggles, snorkel breather thing, enormous awkward fins) for $15, or $18 if you want prescription goggles (which were worth it).<br /><br />Other wildlife to be spotted include Indian Mongooses, one of which I spotted sneaking around beach towels placed too close by shady foliage. Mongooses are invasive, and were <a href="http://www.instanthawaii.com/cgi-bin/hawaii?Animals.mongoose">introduced in the 1700s</a> to the islands to deal with rats eating up the sugarcane. (In the end, diurnal mongooses ended up snacking not on noctural rats, but on the eggs of endemic bird species. Whoops.)<br /><br />Hanauma is open all days except its Tuesday sabbath, and is accessible via the 22, which takes 40 minutes to an hour to get there from Waikiki. Because of the crowds, it&#8217;s best to get there early and leave early, since afternoon buses come every half-hour and sometimes can&#8217;t pick everyone up. (The 22 fills up with visitors from the Sea Life Park before accepting people from Hanauma.)<br /><br />The restaurants we visited that day were <a href="http://www.luluswaikiki.com/">Lulu</a>&#8217;s for breakfast, and Marukame Udon for lunch. Lulu&#8217;s had great loco moco and macadamia coconut waffles (though the latter were quite syrup-drenched and sweet). Marukame ended up being our favorite restaurant the whole trip: the udon is freshly-made, cheap (at about $6 a bowl in <i>Waikiki, </i>where prices are tourist-high), and delicious. The tempura isn&#8217;t bad either. :9<br /><br />The best times to go to Marukame are around 3 to 4; after that, it&#8217;s dinner rush.<br /><br />Another place we visited throughout our trip was Tropical Dream Ice Cream, a hole-in-the-wall ice cream place right next to the Seaside Hotel. It served delicious ice cream with local ingredients, including but not limited to: mango, pineapple coconut sorbet, macadamia nut&#8230;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mUPlgihczuQ/UBG77mScgjI/AAAAAAAABzg/YXF5ojUSGdU/s1600/DSC_0387.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mUPlgihczuQ/UBG77mScgjI/AAAAAAAABzg/YXF5ojUSGdU/s320/DSC_0387.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">macadamia nut tastes great with john steinbeck</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><b>Tuesday</b><br />We spent this day walking through downtown Honolulu to try loco moco at L&amp;L&#8217;s, which is kind of like a Hawaiian McDonalds, except all the food comes on white styrofoam trays. (It was pretty good, though almost overly-filling. Then again, maybe we hadn&#8217;t recovered from Marukame the previous day.)<br /><br />The main goal for the day was to visit the <a href="http://www1.honolulu.gov/parks/hbg/fbg.htm">Foster Botanical Garden</a>, one of the many botanical gardens on O&#8217;ahu. The guides at front said it would take about an hour to get through. We went a little fast, but still enjoyed the enormous &#8220;exceptional&#8221; trees, which included this absolutely enormous palm tree:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ihpeylCI02o/UBG83kyBa6I/AAAAAAAABzo/ezRnj-zgRCo/s1600/DSC_0188.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ihpeylCI02o/UBG83kyBa6I/AAAAAAAABzo/ezRnj-zgRCo/s400/DSC_0188.jpg" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">you are so big!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Another cool tree is thorny, percussive&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couroupita_guianensis">cannonball tree</a>&nbsp;(not pictured), and the striped rainbow eucalyptus (below).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LE6alCTs7_Q/UBG9tlOJcfI/AAAAAAAABzw/X9glRa9-t0Y/s1600/DSC_0231.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LE6alCTs7_Q/UBG9tlOJcfI/AAAAAAAABzw/X9glRa9-t0Y/s400/DSC_0231.jpg" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">you are so colorful!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />We also visited the Waikiki Aquarium, which is fairly small but worth a visit if neon-colored fish are your thing. (The giftshop at Hanauma also offers a coupon for $1 off adult admission to the Waikiki Aquarium.) The most impressive part to me was the &#8220;enormous giant huge fish exhibit,&#8221; in which various person-sized fish like the giant trevally circle around.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aW1_5wo7c0I/UBG-eFgoBoI/AAAAAAAABz4/W4CKX6y4lb8/s1600/DSC_0290.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aW1_5wo7c0I/UBG-eFgoBoI/AAAAAAAABz4/W4CKX6y4lb8/s640/DSC_0290.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">you are so, so big</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rZvwdi2nSBI/UBG-tQ7dt9I/AAAAAAAAB0A/3ezRp5M1c8E/s1600/DSC_0246.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rZvwdi2nSBI/UBG-tQ7dt9I/AAAAAAAAB0A/3ezRp5M1c8E/s640/DSC_0246.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">cue the children screaming &#8220;NEMOO&#8221;</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I think we also tried hiking up to Makapu&#8217;u on this day. It&#8217;s reachable by taking the 22 or 23 to Sea Life Park and walking back and up along the highway. The trail is simple &#8211; just an upward curve &#8211; and at the top is a lookout point with a small lighthouse.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VEB4LIe41Lg/UBK6Ah4VbJI/AAAAAAAAB1g/-U3M_YO2_h8/s1600/IMG_0058.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VEB4LIe41Lg/UBK6Ah4VbJI/AAAAAAAAB1g/-U3M_YO2_h8/s320/IMG_0058.jpg" width="239" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the breeze was so strong and nice</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I liked the view back down almost better.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-N4QmospHtA8/UBK6JlJwFJI/AAAAAAAAB1o/EMa10Z6VgxY/s1600/IMG_0062.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-N4QmospHtA8/UBK6JlJwFJI/AAAAAAAAB1o/EMa10Z6VgxY/s400/IMG_0062.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i can&#8217;t remember the name of this mountain, though. diamondhead?</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><b>Wednesday</b><br />On Wednesday we headed out super early to visit Eggs n Things, a restaurant in Waikiki where we had seen a pretty sizable line of people waiting at around 7am. Luckily, time zones made it easy for us to wake up and head out in time to avoid a 20+ minute wait, and the food (loco moco, and banana/macadamia nut french toast) turned out to be just as delicious as hoped. Eggs n Things also has their own triplet of syrups, flavored guava, pineapple, and coconut. They were so delicious I bought the coconut one to take home, only realizing later and with sorrow that one ingredient is <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/05/things-i-learned-from-extra-virginity.html">partially hydrogenated oil</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zwlxi_8jR5Y/UBK4Whmy1kI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/WcCeoqfRr-E/s1600/eggsnthings.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zwlxi_8jR5Y/UBK4Whmy1kI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/WcCeoqfRr-E/s320/eggsnthings.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">loco moco &amp; fancy french toast at eggs n things</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It was the first Wednesday of the month, so we were intending to visit the <a href="http://honolulumuseum.org/">Honolulu Museum of Art</a>&nbsp;on their free day, but because it was also a holiday (July 4th), the museum was closed. We headed up to the <a href="http://www.bishopmuseum.org/">Bishop Museum</a> instead, which was great and had a variety of Hawaii-specific exhibits.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-11WaQ3u2RzA/UBK7EAn6k8I/AAAAAAAAB1w/6maYYjCEQxk/s1600/IMG_0064.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-11WaQ3u2RzA/UBK7EAn6k8I/AAAAAAAAB1w/6maYYjCEQxk/s320/IMG_0064.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">bishop museum courtyard</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A science building describes Hawaii&#8217;s biological diversity and formation with wax volcano simulations, and other buildings contain many cultural and historical artifacts from the Asian immigrants who worked on the sugarcane plantations. We were also able to catch a show in the observatory that showed us where and how to spot Mercury and Venus in the night sky.<br /><br /><br /><b>Thursday</b><br />Thursday was our dedicated &#8220;North Shore&#8221; day. We caught early buses to Waimea Valley Adventure Park. It took two hours to get there, but the drive was quite scenic.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XwtNTeR3EZ0/UBHCZMLq1JI/AAAAAAAAB0k/9W3uds8VbCM/s1600/DSC_0328.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XwtNTeR3EZ0/UBHCZMLq1JI/AAAAAAAAB0k/9W3uds8VbCM/s640/DSC_0328.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a beach near/in waimea valley</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Waimea stands for &#8220;red water,&#8221; and I think refers to how the dirt is reddish with oxidation? (Citation needed.) Waimea Valley Adventure Park itself is a huge botanical garden which leads up to a freshwater waterfall where visitors can swim if rainfall hasn&#8217;t made the area mudslide-hazardous.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Onw1lKavCIk/UBHDBT_1nAI/AAAAAAAAB0s/LQli7K3Ckg0/s1600/DSC_0352.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Onw1lKavCIk/UBHDBT_1nAI/AAAAAAAAB0s/LQli7K3Ckg0/s640/DSC_0352.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">waimea falls</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The falls are cold and 30 feet deep in areas, and floats are provided for people who aren&#8217;t strong swimmers.<br /><br /><br /><b>Friday</b><br />Our last day in Hawaii was spent visiting Kailua. Kailua has the whitest, finest sand on O&#8217;ahu, but is also littered with little pinecones and needles. The day we went, strong wind turned the sand on the shore into fine little bullets, though underneath the waves it was velvet-soft. You can kayak here to a nearby rocky-looking island, but seeing as I can&#8217;t get 20 feet from the shore without fearing I&#8217;ll be swept into the Pacific Ocean, I was content watching people flail their oars around against the waves.<br /><br />Restaurant recommendation: Boots n Kimos, cash-only, which has very yummy pancakes drenched in macadamia nut cream.<br /><br /><br /><b>In Conclusion</b><br />O&#8217;ahu! It was great.</div>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JQd6Q9TXR70/UA1-MoE_1MI/AAAAAAAABvU/_vonhJbyc5s/s1600/thumbnail.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JQd6Q9TXR70/UA1-MoE_1MI/AAAAAAAABvU/_vonhJbyc5s/s320/thumbnail.png" width="233" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">&#8220;before and after&#8221; comparisons for racermate wireframes</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A couple days ago I made up wireframes for a theoretical redesign of the <a href="http://www.racermateinc.com/">Racermate</a>&nbsp;website, where a couple friends of mine work.<br /><br /><br /><h2> Front Page</h2>First was the front page, which I found personally bewildering: the buttons that frame either side of the wall of &#8220;newsletter&#8221; text at the center of the page don&#8217;t have much context, or direction.&nbsp;&#8220;MultiRider Software,&#8221; &#8220;MultiRider Center Locations&#8221; &#8211; what is that, what do I do with it, why is it relevant? &#8220;Wingate Testing with Velotron&#8221; &#8211; what does this indicate or mean to a new user? &#8220;ErgVideo.com&#8221; seems to open a new website completely, how is it affiliated to Racermate, what does it do?<br /><br />For the redesign, I focused on making the site informative to new users.&nbsp;I kept much of the information in the header &#8220;The WORLD LEADER in ELECTRONIC BICYCLE ERGOMETERS&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;OFFICIAL BIKE TRAINERS OF&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; because they&#8217;re good explanations of &#8220;This is who we are, this is why we are trustworthy.&#8221;<br /><br />I made the top navigation buttons larger than in the original design, and made them more self-explanatory: &#8220;COACHES&#8221; in the original turned into &#8220;Find a coach;&#8221; &#8220;MultiRider&#8221; became &#8220;MultiRider: Ride Together&#8221; to give the user more grounding on what they would learn about when clicking through. This would also expand users&#8217; knowledge of Racermate products right on the front page; MultiRider can be immediately understood as a social application of a RacerMate product.<br /><br />The next two &#8220;rows&#8221; of information also serve to focus and explain Racermate through images, rather than text. The first row is a carousel of images, text description, and links to different Racermate products; the next, a much more involved &#8220;This is who we are&#8221; statement.<br /><br />Because word of mouth is important to this product, part of the front page is also devoted to testimonials sent in by happy consumers.<br /><br /><br /><h2> Product Display Page</h2>Talking with friends at Racermate, I learned that online orders make up a little more than half of the total number of orders that this company gets. But when I went through the website myself, I found the <a href="http://www.computrainer.com/rm_inc/sales/pricing_ordering.html">order page</a> bewildering and cluttered with a variety of colors of clots of text. As a new user unfamiliar with the product, I didn&#8217;t understand what exactly the product would be when I ordered it, or what would come with it, or what exactly it is meant to do. To get a full picture of what some products do requires that the user navigate to half a dozen completely different pages. Ordering information is also separated from a product overview, and ordering online requires that the user:<br /><br /><ol><li>Learn about the product by navigating around &#8220;Products&#8221; and all related pages in the top navigation</li><li>Click &#8220;Sales&#8221; in the top navigation</li><li>Hover over desired product</li><li>Click &#8220;Pricing &amp; Information&#8221;</li><li>Parse a long order page</li><li>Click &#8220;Add to Cart&#8221;</li><li>Complete order</li></ol><br />For the redesign, I made the product name and brief description most prominent, and after that, an easy way to switch between views of different product models. Another prominent part of the product display page are images of the product. Features can be described in the text to the right of the product images, or reviewed with more detail further down the page. In the redesign, the steps for ordering online now are:<br /><br /><ol><li>Click &#8220;Products&#8221; in the top navigation, or hover over &#8220;Products&#8221; and select desired product</li><li>Learn about product and its models on a single page</li><li>Click &#8220;Add to Cart&#8221;</li><li>Complete order</li></ol><div><br /></div><br /><h2> What&#8217;s next?</h2><br />A low-fidelity prototype would ensure that the navigation of the website actually makes sense; users would have to be able to know how to complete certain tasks, such as <i>Find out what exactly you get when you order a CompuTrainer</i>, and with real copy provided, we could ensure that the right kind of information is shown on the right pages. (For example, do people want to know more about certain complex features? Less?) User testing would also target current users who use the website as a hub for Racermate-related news, and ensure that they aren&#8217;t alienated.</div>

The idea was that if you were hungry, but not sure what exactly you wanted to eat, you could just sit here and click <i>Random picture!</i>&nbsp;until you saw something sufficiently appetizing, nearby, and cheap.<br /><br />The first thing to do was to make sure that this idea wasn&#8217;t already done. Looking around, we (me and <a href="http://joshuahou.com/">Joshua Hou</a>, my then partner) turned up a couple similar sites, including:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Yelp</b>: the obvious comparison. But, though at the time it incorporated user-contributed photos of food, it didn&#8217;t do it to the extent that we wanted to support it.</li><li><b>Google Hotpot</b>: newly released at the time, but, despite its food-related name, still not all about photos of food.</li></ul><br />The main task that I wanted to support foremost was, <i>Look at pictures of food, and see where they are.</i>&nbsp;For that reason, the two main things on the front page are some random featured food (indicated by numeral 1), and a map (numeral 3). You can also specify and limit what area food is shown from (numeral 6).<br /><br />The other main task here is <i>Find a specific kind of food,</i>&nbsp;which is supported by the search bar at the top of the page.<br /><br />Another aspect of the site is the ability to comment and rate dishes &#8211; but since this should really be secondary to &#8220;Look at delicious things!&#8221; it&#8217;s limited to ratings on a five-star scale, and a short description.<br /><br />Views of specific dishes (the wireframe on the bottom-left) show all the photos associated with the dish, as well as comments and ratings. Views of specific restaurants show all photos associated with the dishes at that restaurant, with the idea that a restaurant-specific page would become a crowdsourced visual menu. Which brings me to one question that I have about the concept of this site: how does having photos of food affect the stakeholders here? Fancy restaurants seem fond of depicting menu items with a variety of delicious buzzwords and nothing else, and when you, as the diner, finally receive your food, part of the pleasure is the surprise of seeing what it looks like. Along with general usability testing, questions like this would be part of &#8220;next steps&#8221; for this design.</div>

At Fugazo, I was hired initially to design a hidden object game. I&#8217;ve made a couple of posts about&nbsp;<a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search?q=hidden+object">this type of game</a>, but never talked about mine, which was going to be a fantastical version a la <a href="http://www.boomzap.com/">Boomzap</a>&#8217;s <i>Awakening</i> series, which would hopefully shine in a market saturated with grimy amusement parks and children being stolen and dangled off cliff-ledges by evil wizards.<br /><br />The premise of the story was that a village had had its special crown stolen by a thief, who wanted it for a queen in a distant land, who in turn wanted it so she could look cool at parties. The crown was a symbol of the ancient pact the village had with the elements, and upon its disappearance havoc arose: cookfires burst, water slid away from mouths and flasks, the air blew cold, stones rolled across the feet of weary villagers, etc.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YtmP55ls_xA/UAN1Xkcy1CI/AAAAAAAABqs/WjAqz6RtxtQ/s1600/elements+map+3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="481" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YtmP55ls_xA/UAN1Xkcy1CI/AAAAAAAABqs/WjAqz6RtxtQ/s640/elements+map+3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a sketch of the world map;<br />the big part is the temple, the bottom-left part the village</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The elemental avatars were housed in a temple with four quarters on some massive landmass overlooking the village. Wanting to set things straight, the villagers send a girl to temple to make peace, and she ventures bravely despite the fact that avatars are known to turn annoying trespassers into statues or sparrows or whatever else pleases them. Upon arriving at the temple, the girl runs into a talking hawk, who aids her in her quest with dry banter and the occasional vague StarCraft reference. (&#8220;You need more crystals! &#8230;to finish this mini-game&#8221;)<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c-L6g8ERer0/UAOpUQ1fCiI/AAAAAAAABsE/PW2TzcL9s_s/s1600/elements+dragon.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c-L6g8ERer0/UAOpUQ1fCiI/AAAAAAAABsE/PW2TzcL9s_s/s640/elements+dragon.jpg" width="584" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the avatar of the fire temple, a kind of fuzzy dragoness</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In the end, it turns out that the hawk has been the thief all along; he had been turned into a hawk as punishment for getting lost and rummaging around the sacred temple. At the conclusion of the game, an epic match-three-kinda mini-game ensues in which the girl/you defeat him and win the crown back.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time playing other games for ideas on mini-games, and prototyping them out on paper, and testing them against coworkers.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1ZQsf6z184g/UAN4jKVzGbI/AAAAAAAABrA/t4dbVRs3tpA/s1600/c1d4510e072011e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1ZQsf6z184g/UAN4jKVzGbI/AAAAAAAABrA/t4dbVRs3tpA/s320/c1d4510e072011e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a photo of a paper prototype inspired by UW&#8217;s <a href="http://games.cs.washington.edu/Refraction/refraction.html">Refraction</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also spent a non-negligible amount of time outlining the various areas of the temple in a composition notebook, which I filled to the margins with cheap ballpoint ink (as it is a favorite tool of mine, beside Steadler mechanical pencils).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6xHGGSMHnWE/UAN395Irb3I/AAAAAAAABq4/oLIc7ojXnkc/s1600/elements+earth+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="408" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6xHGGSMHnWE/UAN395Irb3I/AAAAAAAABq4/oLIc7ojXnkc/s640/elements+earth+temple.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(page 1/2) a scan of my sketchbook with various areas drawn out for the &#8220;earth temple&#8221;</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l9XshfoY4Tk/UAOq_xYyZBI/AAAAAAAABsM/CE3zetuT_Hs/s1600/elements+forest.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="415" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l9XshfoY4Tk/UAOq_xYyZBI/AAAAAAAABsM/CE3zetuT_Hs/s640/elements+forest.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(page 2/2) a scan of my sketchbook with various areas drawn out for the &#8220;earth temple&#8221; </td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also laid out certain rooms and angles for detail and fun.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--x7SzByFqJ8/UAN50iElStI/AAAAAAAABrI/l2aJAKT3C-M/s1600/elements+fire+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="185" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--x7SzByFqJ8/UAN50iElStI/AAAAAAAABrI/l2aJAKT3C-M/s320/elements+fire+temple.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketch of the fire temple&#8217;s &#8220;tea room&#8221;</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B4vx2Xcbrws/UAN53Woe0FI/AAAAAAAABrQ/OHHMFzZI2Mg/s1600/elements+water+throne.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="184" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B4vx2Xcbrws/UAN53Woe0FI/AAAAAAAABrQ/OHHMFzZI2Mg/s320/elements+water+throne.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketch of the water temple&#8217;s &#8220;throne room&#8221;</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c5z8VivuyT0/UAN5_IwrX6I/AAAAAAAABrY/I4cvgSpziUk/s1600/elements+fire+overhead.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c5z8VivuyT0/UAN5_IwrX6I/AAAAAAAABrY/I4cvgSpziUk/s640/elements+fire+overhead.jpg" width="434" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketch of the fire temple</td></tr></tbody></table><br />One unfortunate thing is that I don&#8217;t have much in-game art to show. Since the art made from these sketches is &#8220;really&#8221; the work of my team&#8217;s artists, I&#8217;m not comfortable sharing it. What mini-games were implemented aren&#8217;t something that can be easily shared either, as are the environments and dialogue that I scripted out using our in-game scene editor&#8230;so, bummer.<br /><br />Why was the project canceled? Mainly because our small team (one designer, one programmer, and roughly four artists) couldn&#8217;t compete with much larger teams working on the market. Art style is at the forefront of the hidden object genre, with many players turning away if something is too dark or too colorful, and we didn&#8217;t have the power to create, polish, and re-polish within a reasonable timeframe, especially with the paint-y style that we wanted to move forward with. &nbsp;There was also greater interest with pursuing more &#8220;game-y&#8221; games, hidden objects being fairly linear.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mPTPHA4aTQo/UAOokIYbyJI/AAAAAAAABr8/bTRj-F6cECw/s1600/elements+air+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="408" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mPTPHA4aTQo/UAOokIYbyJI/AAAAAAAABr8/bTRj-F6cECw/s640/elements+air+temple.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketches of the air temple, which (spoilers) was going to be on the back of a bird<br />that blue is a plastic tape-bookmarker-thing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Perhaps some elements of&#8230;Elements&#8230;will be recycled for future projects.</div>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kyLTykn1SaA/UAMFyJo1V9I/AAAAAAAABqI/KGa3OmatUYM/s1600/10174795.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kyLTykn1SaA/UAMFyJo1V9I/AAAAAAAABqI/KGa3OmatUYM/s320/10174795.jpg" width="213" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10174795-glow">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I rarely do book reviews, because I personally feel that what makes a book good is a convoluted stew of good feelings and fresh learning that can&#8217;t be condensed into recipe. Furthermore, when I encounter a book I dislike, I concede that there are many people who like it, who were searching within it for something that I was not searching for, something that they found and I didn&#8217;t. Why look for the sky in the sea?<br /><br />I want to ~*engage more critically*~ with what I read, however, so&#8230;here I go!<br /><br />First, the cover description:<br /><blockquote><i>The Empyrean is the only home fifteen-year-old Waverly has ever known. Part of the first generation to be successfully conceived in deep space, she and her boyfriend, Kieran, will be pioneers of New Earth. Waverly knows she must marry young in order to have children who can carry on the mission, and Kieran, the handsome captain-to-be, has everything Waverly could want in a husband. Everyone is sure he&#8217;s the best choice. Still, there&#8217;s a part of Waverly that wants more from life than marriage, and she is secretly intrigued by the sky, darkly brilliant Seth.</i><br /><br /><i>Suddenly, Waverly&#8217;s dreams are interrupted by the inconceivable &#8211; a violent betrayal by the Empyrean&#8217;s sister ship, the New Horizon. The New Horizon&#8217;s leaders are desperate to populate the new planet first, and will do anything to get what they need: young girls. In one pivotal moment, Waverly and Kieran are separated, and they find themselves at the helms of dangerous missions, where every move has potentially devastating consequences, and the decisions of the heart may lead to disaster.</i></blockquote>I found this book on the library shelf and thought the premise was interesting enough. I would have said maybe half a year ago that I adore YA, but recently most YA novels have disappointed me in terms of the shallowness with which they engage their issues, and inability to stray from a plot that involves a love triangle.<br /><br />Glow is the first book of a YA trilogy, because YA novels always come in triplets now, I suppose. The story is so fast-paced that there&#8217;s not enough time to learn about anyone. What you do know about people is told to you outright, rather than shown firsthand through character interactions, through things that happen.<br /><br />One of the first characters you are told about is Waverly, through the eyes of Kieran.<br /><blockquote>[Waverly] was a watchful person, and intelligent, a trait that showed in the deliberate way her dark eyes found their mark and held it steady. She had a way of seeing into people and understanding their motives that Kieran found almost unnerving [&#8230;]</blockquote>This description comes right after Kieran asks Waverly to marry him, and comes in lieu of Waverly actually <i>doing</i> any of the things that Kieran says are characteristic of her. When Waverly guesses earlier that Kieran is extending a proposal to her, it isn&#8217;t written like something that she understands with her Waverly-special power. At some point Waverly is &#8220;unreadable in the way she looked at him, waiting, saying nothing,&#8221; which could parallel the way &#8220;her dark eyes found their mark and held it steady&#8221; &#8211; in which case, why not put Kieran&#8217;s observation of her characteristic gaze <i>there</i>, right when the action is happening?<br /><br />Another character is the Captain:<br /><blockquote>In truth, the Captain was the most purposeful man on the ship, quick with his decisions, which were almost always right, and trusted by all the men on the ship, though he was less popular with women.</blockquote>Imagine how much more compelling the Captain character would have been if he was shown in some brief situation with his council or something, and the Captain said, &#8220;Listen, this thing just happened, so we need to do X,&#8221; and the men said, &#8220;Oh my gosh, I must act on your will immediately,&#8221; whereas the women eyed him sidelong and were like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about this.&#8221; You would have learned that the captain was &#8220;trusted by all the men on the ship, though he was less popular with the women,&#8221; with the added bonus of actually seeing it yourself.<br /><br />This is assuming that it&#8217;s ever going to be important that the Captain is less popular with women, which it isn&#8217;t. On page 82 it turns out that Waverly has felt uncomfortable in the male gaze of <i>many</i> men on the ship, which means that the fact that the Captain is unpopular as an individual should be unworthy of note. It just doesn&#8217;t <i>mean anything</i> in the long run.<br /><br />Backstories are also blurted out in solid paragraphs. You&#8217;re handheld through Waverly&#8217;s history with Seth, her second love interest, and with her ex-best-friend Felicity. Maybe the point of the book wasn&#8217;t for Waverly share these experiences firsthand with the reader; but the resulting effect is that these characters are like dolls that are handed to you, rather than &#8220;real people.&#8221;<br /><br />There are also characters that are completely meaningless, like Serafina Mbewe, &#8220;a sweet little girl&#8221; who is deaf. What does it mean that she&#8217;s deaf? Does deafness happen all the time? Did this ship heading for the brand new human world prepare for deaf people? Can Serafina communicate at all? Later, after an announcement by Anne Mathers that the girls&#8217; families are dead, Waverly &#8220;picked up Serafina Mbewe, who was crying&#8221; &#8211; wait, <i>what</i>? Did deaf Serafina hear the announcement? Lipread it? Did Serafina just pick up the distressed atmosphere of the girls around her? Is Serafina just meant to be the token helpless child that shows up to prove that Waverly cares about other people, even if Waverly doesn&#8217;t exhibit any caring by way of worrying about her or thinking about her throughout the book? Serafina is a deaf child amidst a world of not-deaf children, so she sticks out; but she does little to support Waverly&#8217;s character, and doesn&#8217;t do anything to advance the plot.<br /><br />The book&#8217;s premise necessarily involves issues of gender and sex, but the way it treats it is shallow, and in some places cringe-worthy. In a book with so many female characters, it&#8217;s still all about women reacting to men&#8217;s actions and desires. The women of the book are notable for wanting children. And here&#8217;s Waverly, on page 93:<br /><blockquote>Days before, her biggest worry was about marrying Kieran. She should have said yes to him, with no hesitation. <i>Yes, Kieran, I will marry you. I love you.</i> <strong>He needed to hear that, and she should have given it to him.</strong></blockquote>Wait, WHAT?! Waverly &#8211; what about <i>your</i> feelings? Are we seriously reading about something like marriage being something that Waverly should have done to please Kieran? Maybe this is supposed to be an example of Waverly succumbing to men&#8217;s desires, you know, a bad example, something that she rises above &#8211; but, nope. Waverly muses on how Kieran deserved her approval and acceptance of him, despite any (unsaid) feelings she has about him herself, and that&#8217;s that.<br /><br />There are also issues with setting. Waverly has been on a spaceship her entire life. At some point, Waverly describes:<br /><blockquote>Few adults on the Empyrean had been willing to talk about their planet of origin&#8230;. They always changed the subject if she asked too many questions [&#8230;]</blockquote>Which means that what Waverly knows about Earth, or Earth things, likely comes only from the ship&#8217;s environment, or from the classes she&#8217;s taken. Yet, later:<br /><blockquote>&#8220;Have you ever had ice cream?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We don&#8217;t carry cows on the Empyrean,&#8221; Waverly said [&#8230;]</blockquote>Wait, <i>what</i>? Okay, so there are no cows on the Empyrean &#8211; but Waverly knows what a cow <i>is</i>? Even if she had learned about what a cow is, through classes or through an adult&#8217;s hidden past, Waverly not only knows what a cow is, but that milk can be harvested from it, and that milk can be processed to create food products, which includes something called ice cream? Waverly knows all this about a creature which she has never seen personally, and who she really should have no reason to even learn about, since there are no cows on the Empyrean?<br /><br />It&#8217;s an example of the narrowness of this setting despite its uniqueness. How do young characters like Waverly,&nbsp;born on the ship, clash with characters that once lived on Earth? Was the transition from &#8220;I have an entire world to roam&#8221; to &#8220;Now I live on this ship&#8221; made with such ease that no child ever sees an adult struggle with it? (I mean, older people seem to struggle all the time with the ease with which children master iPods and computers.) Is there even amber on the Empyrean for Waverly to use as reference when she describes Kieran&#8217;s eyes as &#8220;amber brown&#8221;? Even if there was, wouldn&#8217;t it be so much cooler if Waverly was like, Wow, Kieran&#8217;s eyes are <i>amber</i>, the color of something that exists on my home planet that I&#8217;ve never seen, which can only be made from the amazing phenomenon of placing tree resin under sustained heat and pressure?<br /><br />Furthermore, certain problems that I expected don&#8217;t crop up at all; for example, didn&#8217;t anyone on this mission ever think about inbreeding? They want to populate an entire new world of humans, yet impregnate dozens of women from the eggs of a couple girls? There&#8217;s not even one note about how bad this could potentially be in the distant future?<br /><br />What I did like about this book was the movement of religion through the characters, and especially the switch-around that happened between the ships and Waverly and Kieran&#8217;s motivations. Given the pace and breadth of characters and setting introduced, however, &#8220;Glow&#8221; really feels like the second of its trilogy, a book that hands over its characters and settings as given, rather than letting them grow.</div>

Thanks! If you do decide to read any, I recommend Kenneth Oppel&#39;s &quot;Matt Cruse&quot; series (is it even YA? Suddenly I&#39;m not sure, but they&#39;re fun), Speak and Wintergirls by Laurie Halse Anderson (which are not fantasy, but deal with sexual assault and anorexia), and The Hunger Games (which is like the poster child of YA right now, especially this new genre of &quot;dystopian trilogy,&quot; haha).</div>

Nice review! Maybe I should read some YA fiction sometime, just to see if I can pick it apart like you have here&#8230; :)</div>
