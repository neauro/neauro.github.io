By that point, each unnamed ‘brat’ has trained into one of three groups–Breeders, Builders, or Hunters, identifiable by the number of scars they bear on their arms. Deuce has wanted to be a Huntress for as long as she can remember.<br /><br />As a Huntress, her purpose is clear—to brave the dangerous tunnels outside the enclave and bring back meat to feed the group while evading ferocious monsters known as Freaks. She’s worked toward this goal her whole life, and nothing’s going to stop her, not even a beautiful, brooding Hunter named Fade. When the mysterious boy becomes her partner, Deuce’s troubles are just beginning.<br /><br />When she and Fade discover that the neighboring enclave has been destroyed by Freaks, who seem to be growing more organized, the elders refuse to listen to their warnings and exile Deuce and Fade. As t he two are guided out of the dead city by Fade&#8217;s long-ago memories, they face dangers, and feelings, unlike any they&#8217;ve ever known.</em></blockquote><br />I had to admit that I read Enclave just for something simple and easy to gnaw at&nbsp;between textbooks. It contains (what is inexplicably) my favorite male character&nbsp;stereotype, The Dark Loner with Mysterious/Potentially Tortured Past. What can I&nbsp;say? Some people chill out with chocolate or a reality TV show; I do it with the&nbsp;darkest, most tormented love interest I can find.<br /><br />Enclave was at first satisfying as far as &#8220;chill out&#8221; reading goes, but halfway through pivots, sheds or destroys almost all of the character relationships and world that it constructed, and goes running off haphazardly in a completely new and bewildering direction. The book, which had started in the underground ruins of New York, expels Deuce and Fade to the sunlit &#8220;Topside&#8221; at the drop of a hat, due to a conspiracy which had never before been mentioned but which Deuce suddenly realizes has been exposing itself in the form of innocents exiled to the &#8220;Topside&#8221; every once in a while.<br /><br />Deuce&#8217;s two best friends since childhood betray her, throwing away pages of friendship-building for no conceivable reason. A resistance to the enclave&#8217;s evil leadership, newly uncovered and heated in the ominous death of a well-beloved character, becomes irrelevant.<br /><br />Once on Topside, which turns out to be Fade&#8217;s original home, Fade motivates their progression northward, following a dream of better land that I have no idea why he didn&#8217;t follow before he was led underground. Deuce at some point is captured by Topside gangers, and meets Tegan, &#8220;liberally covered in bruises&#8221; and obviously lacking status amidst &#8220;the males&#8221; around her:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>She left my hands tied. </i>Smart girl. Well, relatively.<i style="font-style: italic;"> </i><i style="font-style: italic;">She couldn&#8217;t be too </i><i>smart if she took those bruises without complaining, but as I knew, you could used to anything.</i></blockquote><br />Wait, huh? How do you know she&#8217;s not complaining? Is she not smart because she&#8217;s being <i>abused?</i><br /><i><br /></i> Later, Tegan admits,<br /><br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost two cubs in the last year. The last time, I almost died. That was when I decided, if I ever got a chance to run, I&#8217;d take it. So I bided my time.&#8221;</i></blockquote><br />Okay, so Teagan has been likely made to have sex and children against her will, likely taken in a raid for &#8220;Breeders&#8221; by Stalker. Do you feel sympathy now, Deuce?<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Stalker shrugged, as though [Teagan&#8217;s] opinion didn&#8217;t matter to him. I understood, I thought. He could respect Fade and me because we&#8217;d fought. Because she hadn&#8217;t, Tegan might never gain full value in his eyes.</i></blockquote><i><br /></i><i>No. I cannot even marginally respect that Deuce can &#8220;understand&#8221; why Tegan may not have &#8220;full value.&#8221;</i>&nbsp;Depicting a possible rape victim as a weakling who isn&#8217;t respected because she didn&#8217;t&nbsp;<em>fight until she died</em>&nbsp;is not okay, not even in a fictional universe, because no universe born from a mind raised in this one is free from the influences of a society where rape is still something people joke about, trivialize, and often blame on the survivor.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t think the problematic elements of this story could get any more ridiculous until the character that had held Tegan captive, the aforementioned Stalker, became a love interest. Though Tegan is considered to be a friend by Deuce, there&#8217;s still a sense that Stalker, the abuser, is more easily forgiven and respected than Tegan, the abused. How can this be even partially attractive?<br /><br />In the end, I can&#8217;t appreciate a book that takes heavy concepts like patriarchy and sexual abuse and, rather than examining them critically, only perpetuates them.</div>
