    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/aceattorney5.png" alt="Apollo Justice, Phoenix Wright, and Athena Cykes from Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/10/24/phoenix-wright-dual-destinies-review-f8ea4d29/">via</a>)</p>


<p>After NaNoWriMo finished, my pastime of choice during my commute became playing through <em>Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies</em>.</p>

<p>[ spoilers ahead ]</p>

<p>Athena was a cool protagonist, though scenes where she was relegated to &ldquo;cyncial dude&rsquo;s naive, enthusiastic female sidekick&rdquo; were yawny. (Come on! Maya and Trucy are already these characters, we don&rsquo;t need more of them.) Ultimately it&rsquo;s nice to see that Athena has her own reasons for entering the attourneyforce, and though they were man-centered they were also totally platonic, which was nice. Athena&rsquo;s devoting to &ldquo;saving&rdquo; Blackquill also mirrored her desire to save her best friend, Juniper Woods, which meant her dramatic, heroic tendencies at least were in character.</p>

<p>Mostly I was happy to see old characters again, even Apollo Justice, who I disliked before but liked in <em>Dual Destinies</em>, probably because he was now a familiar face, haha. What I wanted most out of this game was to see Maya again, but I guess a note from her will do in lieu of <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>I also liked <em>Dual Destinies</em>&lsquo; execution of &ldquo;telling the end at the beginning.&rdquo; One of my favorite parts was realizing that Apollo had had an eyepatch over his eye even <em>before the courtroom explosion</em> — it was a fun/cute manipulation of the audience&rsquo;s assumptions that that particular bandage was just part of his injuries.</p>

<p>Good examples of &ldquo;the end at the beginning&rdquo; does <em>not</em>, however, include all the times that the game felt obliged to either tell you who the antagonist was, or make it clearly obvious, and PWDD&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&comic=123013">serious case of the hand-holdies</a>&rdquo; led to me to really only loving the game&rsquo;s final case, and feeling shruggy about the others. It would have been nice if each case had contributed more to each character&rsquo;s development as well; &ldquo;Ninetails Vale&rdquo; in particular didn&rsquo;t feel tied to anything in the larger story, and as a standalone wasn&rsquo;t terribly interesting to me either.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZKxZeym4hI/UnhNh5LTGHI/AAAAAAAAER8/ijPCNF5uWhM/s1600/pokemonxy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZKxZeym4hI/UnhNh5LTGHI/AAAAAAAAER8/ijPCNF5uWhM/s640/pokemonxy.jpg" width="510" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshots of the websites for Pokemon X &amp; Y<br />Japan (above), Netherlands (bottom)</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">A couple weeks ago we analyzed the marketing sites for Pokemon X and Y across different countries. It turns out that all sites for Pokemon X and Y are the same — except for the one in Japan, which is shown at the top of the screenshot above.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The differences between the Japanese site and the rest-of-the-world sites include:</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1"><br /></div><h4>Feature Descriptions</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites contain more information about the game, for example, direct links to features like the Pokemon Global Link; on the Japanese site, these are internal.</div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Hype</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites feature a large image carousel on their homepage, which shows other features of the game, all shown to excite:&nbsp;<i>Discover the Might of Mega-Evolved Pokemon! A New World of Amazing Pokemon!</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div>In contrast, the front page of the Japanese site merely says:&nbsp;<i>Pokemon, heading to a brand new dimension</i>! (Referring, I think, to the 3D?)</div></div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Obvious Marketing</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites contain immediate links to buy the game, as well as the 3DS; the Japanese site does not. (According to Julius, the 2DS isn't even available in Japan, perhaps because "Everyone there already has a 3DS!")</div></div><div><h4><br /></h4><h4>JavaScript</h4><div>The Japanese site has very little Javascript, and each page looks to be straight HTML. Additionally, text is often baked straight into the images, rather than being left as straight text, which is often the case in websites due to accessibility issues. (Text on images cannot be easily parsed by screenreaders. Some users also prefer to render text on websites to be more readable, for example, through the excellent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.beelinereader.com/">BeeLine</a>&nbsp;app.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Description vs. Instruction</h4><div>The Japanese site is more descriptive of the story and characters of the game; the non-Japanese site is more instructive of how to play the Pokemon game.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="p1">We chalked up the majority of the differences the fact that Pokemon is more popular in Japan; Japanese game-players may not need to be particularly taught about Pokemon, or persuaded to buy it. But, this exercise makes me more interested in other facets of Japanese web design. Why is there so much baked-in text, why aren't there fancy hover menu states, why is the design so flat compared to the chrome and bevels of the non-Japanese sites? Is web accessibility less important in the Japanese corner of the internet, or is it handled in a way that's different in the US?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">One final note: out class lecture that week was done by Kate Edwards, current Executive Director of IGDA, who shared some cool stories regarding the "culturization" problems she's encountered when helping to ship games across international borders. Something she noted was that, in the Netherlands, "adult" games don't need to be localized into Dutch because the adults there prefer to play the games in English. So, the fact that the Pokemon X and Y site text is all written in Dutch…</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><br /><div class="p1">…well…you can totally still enjoy the world of Kalos as a grown-up grad student with a full-time job. Just saying!</div></div>

And weirdness! And mysteriousness!</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Spoilers ahead.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>1.</h2></div><div class="p1">One of my favorite parts of adventure games is the characterization that rises through interaction with items. Do characters like a certain item, or dislike it? Does the item bring up deep heartbroken memories of the past? How do they parse and react, and what does their rumination say for who they are? I'm reminded of Nancy Drew's endearing enthusiasm for lifting up random objects ("This plastic DNA model will be useful!") and Phoenix Wright's skeptical amusement when things like puppies are added to his inventory.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The most interesting item in the game for me was the toy cat, which I enjoyed petting all the time to accrue invisible "sanity" points. Engaging with the cat toy in particular puts you in the shoes and brain of the lone survivor himself, tinkering with a plush at the end of the world, just to have something light-hearted to do.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>2.</h2></div><div class="p1">Speaking of the cat plush, I loved the detail of this game — the unidentifiable flesh-like substances stretching across the wall — the way your map was dark unless you viewed it under sources of light — the specific food items like Delicious Ham, the creepy bottomless repositories of pills and Rotten Meats.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>3.</h2></div><div class="p1">A criticism of <i>Lone Survivor</i> seems to be that it was not scary enough. I played it at the height of summer and even then it was plenty terrifying, even if most of my stress and fear stemmed from being unable to hoard my bullets as obsessively as I would have liked.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Another scary part: putting your hand in that horrifying pink-red flesh-pixel hole. I <i>really </i>did not want to do that.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>4.</h2></div><div class="p1">The dream sequences were cool, and the characters therein intriguingly surreal, which I loved. Ultimately, however, I didn't feel that these scenes contributed to a larger understanding of what was going on, which was disappointing. Rather than deep, the first ending I received was vague, and a letdown. After carrying and caring for this dude I'd wanted a little more than a whiff of a broken heart. I wanted to know more about what this girl meant to the protagonist, how her departure left his life with zombie-filled corridors.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>5.</h2></div><div class="p1">I got my ending by playing as paragon as possible. I wanted to see if other endings would give me closure, so I found them on Youtube. Each one seemed vaguer than the last, and didn't interest me that much. I don't have a particular love of multiple endings and for me it's because they lack impact: I've only rarely encountered any set that comfortably resolves all issues and tension introduced in the game, and the way that such endings are reached never quite seems to match the decisions you made to get there.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">In the case of <i>Lone Survivor, </i>the decisions that you make add to an invisible calculator which eventually spits out one of these endings: for example, killing more monsters gives you endings that imply you're mentally unstable. But why? What is it about killing these things makes you this way? The worst ending can also be achieved not just by killing monsters, but "eating food when not hungry or hurt" and "sleeping for no reason" (per <a href="http://lonesurvivor.wikia.com/wiki/Endings">this wiki</a>). What's <i>that </i>connection?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>6.</h2></div><div class="p1">This was my other favorite part: getting that white cat to come live with me. I guess it's strange to be saying that after my demands for meaningfulness, since other than the invisible points, hanging out with the cat doesn't reveal any more of the protagonist's inner story. But playing with the cat, I felt for the first time that I was doing something in the game that I personally wanted, like it was really <i>me</i> in there, and not me poking through things in a dude-shaped glove.<br /><br />Come here! Come <i>here</i>, little digital thing!<br /><br /></div><div class="p1"><i>come and be with me forever</i><br /><i><br /></i><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tvhPIy5tDo/UilDcBOQcrI/AAAAAAAAEBc/f6aLd4GxHlk/s1600/Sunny.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tvhPIy5tDo/UilDcBOQcrI/AAAAAAAAEBc/f6aLd4GxHlk/s1600/Sunny.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://lonesurvivor.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><i><br /></i></div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I loved <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/10/bastion-logtistical-est.html">Bastion</a> and I'm super super super excited for <i>Transistor</i>, because it has a female protagonist with curly hair. <i>Curly hair!</i><br /><br />(Or at the very least, <i>wavy hair!</i>)<br /><br />I was not keen on attending PAX this year until I found a friend selling tickets and my compulsion to hoard scarce resources broke through my skepticism of the event. I first went in 2009 and stopped out of boredom and <a href="http://debacle.tumblr.com/">discomfort</a>, but decided I'd give this year another try, not because I think trivializing rape is okay (I <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/genesis-2.html">don't</a>) but because I wanted to see if the environment has changed since <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2013/06/full-ign-interview-with-anita-sarkeesian/">Tropes Vs Women</a>. I also really, really, <i>really</i> wanted to see <i>Transistor</i>.<br /><br />Since I got my tickets late, I started cosplay work only about a month before PAX started, which also happened to be right in the swing of summer quarter. Making the sword was fun and challenging, mostly because it was my first time working with plastic. First I made some sketches and then a model using some leftover foam from my <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2013/04/sakura-con-2013-cosplay-black-rock.html">Strength cosplay</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uP3HTT7dTS4/Uif_sQSC7DI/AAAAAAAAD-s/487Li4QQ4lc/s1600/sketch.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="482" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uP3HTT7dTS4/Uif_sQSC7DI/AAAAAAAAD-s/487Li4QQ4lc/s640/sketch.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">such cosplay wow</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then I visited <a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/">TAP Plastics</a> and after beating around the bush I admitted that I was making a giant sword. Turns out the guy staffing was also a cosplayer and happy to give me advice, which I desperately needed. I had my heart set on a blue-y transparent plastic, which they didn't have, but he explained that if I painted on the backside of clear plastic, <em>it would look like a mirror</em>…and that sounded great! I got a couple samples of green-edge acrylic and tried out a couple different paint colors on it.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lo5wfmiMpD4/Uif_5u8R3wI/AAAAAAAAD-0/S4caFilJwac/s1600/paint+test.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="290" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lo5wfmiMpD4/Uif_5u8R3wI/AAAAAAAAD-0/S4caFilJwac/s640/paint+test.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i was so bright-eyed then</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A pointed out that what would really make the sword striking would be a strong contrast between the base color and "solder lines," so for the base color I decided on using a lot of green to really make the inner lines stand out.<br /><br />Then I visited TAP Plastics to get the pieces cut, and at the last moment decided I wanted not just half an inch thickness of plastic, but a whole inch. Imagine my shock and horror when I realized that such a width of plastic is actually heavy. Like, <em>really</em> heavy. (I don't have a scale, but a friend's estimate when he picked up the final product and grimaced was 35 lbs, so I'm going with that number.)<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8SxFDzB53F0/UigAxKgvILI/AAAAAAAAD-8/e-Q0WPJRfeA/s1600/heavy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="531" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8SxFDzB53F0/UigAxKgvILI/AAAAAAAAD-8/e-Q0WPJRfeA/s640/heavy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">heavy, but still not as unwieldy as strength arms</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My plan was to do a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_glass_painting">reverse painting</a> deal on both sides of the sword and then sandwich them together. I used masking tape to copy out my drawn pattern on both sides, and first painted in the solder lines with a mixture of paints: pearly blue, shiny white, and glow-in-the-dark!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eD85Y44KYCU/UigDLfD2H_I/AAAAAAAAD_Q/sqjs_uu_nhI/s1600/painting.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eD85Y44KYCU/UigDLfD2H_I/AAAAAAAAD_Q/sqjs_uu_nhI/s640/painting.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">left photo courtesy of <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I didn't get to see the glow paint in action, unfortunately, and the fact that it's sort of thick and grainy made me nervous that the plastic pieces would stick together properly when pressed together.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HOuHj5pMteQ/UigFL3SxDwI/AAAAAAAAD_c/pxT8F5MNiZI/s1600/peel+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="478" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HOuHj5pMteQ/UigFL3SxDwI/AAAAAAAAD_c/pxT8F5MNiZI/s640/peel+montage.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">peeling the tape off was <i>so satisfying</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I had two circular pieces of plastic that I wanted to attach to the outside of the sword for the Transistor's red "eye," but there's also a sort of depression/border around the eye. I realized that in my limited time I wouldn't be able to do anything three-dimensional for that border, so I decided to just paint another blue circle.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kei6SIadyXw/UigHA-lNSkI/AAAAAAAAD_o/yicAVzmckIU/s1600/circle.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="489" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kei6SIadyXw/UigHA-lNSkI/AAAAAAAAD_o/yicAVzmckIU/s640/circle.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dry dry dry! (also there's A, because i need another picture to even this out)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Meanwhile, the eye got the same "reverse painting" treatment.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yemSRp3_suM/UigH1_cWiEI/AAAAAAAAD_w/GZqDWc-Bgcg/s1600/eye+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yemSRp3_suM/UigH1_cWiEI/AAAAAAAAD_w/GZqDWc-Bgcg/s640/eye+montage.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i see you</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Once the solder lines were done, I combined green-y metallic paint and blue metallic paint and painted that down across both pieces.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WPj04DrWiJ0/UigIDnuiGtI/AAAAAAAAEAA/CsjwKL-x1eA/s1600/base+color.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WPj04DrWiJ0/UigIDnuiGtI/AAAAAAAAEAA/CsjwKL-x1eA/s640/base+color.jpg" width="425" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">such contrast</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Since I was swamped with making the actual costume, A helped out with the handle and cutting out what we referred to as the "top fins" and "side fins" from plywood. Because the plastic turned out to be so heavy, and because we were pressed for time, we left the handle rectangular, rather than shaved down to the canon cylinder.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AOFidkP7444/UigIgs5iDyI/AAAAAAAAEAI/U6O5SE2-dQ0/s1600/DSC_0275.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AOFidkP7444/UigIgs5iDyI/AAAAAAAAEAI/U6O5SE2-dQ0/s640/DSC_0275.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">plywood fins</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After that, with his father's help, A and I clamped the two pieces together in a vise and drilled holes through the wood and plastic! Again not canon, but the pieces were <em>such heavy wow, </em>and needed that extra reinforcement.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ36fytFm70/UigJlaSW8uI/AAAAAAAAEAU/4XrID4GWUV4/s1600/drill+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ36fytFm70/UigJlaSW8uI/AAAAAAAAEAU/4XrID4GWUV4/s640/drill+montage.jpg" width="508" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so close!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After drilling, we had planned to take the sword apart and touch up the paint a bit, but…after all the clamping, the two pieces of plastic ended up <em>completely stuck together</em>. So much for worrying about it coming apart.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lFnXTGExgtY/UigJylAc8dI/AAAAAAAAEAc/CemsLFy3qgo/s1600/plywood.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lFnXTGExgtY/UigJylAc8dI/AAAAAAAAEAc/CemsLFy3qgo/s640/plywood.jpg" width="424" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the light does cool shading tricks through the plastic</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The last thing to be built was the pommel, which A flashed out overnight. I have no pictures of it, but it was made out of some plastic canisters and a plastic soysauce dish hot-glued together and painted over. Cosplay at its finest. :')<br /><br />Finally, what was left was to paint the plywood pieces, and then glue on the red eye. A also put on some electrical tape to make the side fins appear more indented, but the tape near-immediately fell off during peace-bonding. Ah well!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2tCzKsrHSt8/UigKzHyNehI/AAAAAAAAEAk/mjFAjlJXg7g/s1600/finalish+montage+copy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="456" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2tCzKsrHSt8/UigKzHyNehI/AAAAAAAAEAk/mjFAjlJXg7g/s640/finalish+montage+copy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">done!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />As for the dress itself…I reused the racer-back tank pattern I made for the Strength cosplay, though I made it longer and added a kind of cape for the sleeves. I wanted to sew the jacket as well but ran out of time and ended up compromising by sewing a satin triangle to a long black jacket I found at a consignment store a couple days before PAX. The last thing I did was the feather collar, which I made by sewing feathers into leftover Strength felt and sewing it around the dress's neck.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v5pXoNDFlwg/UigLYHBNKzI/AAAAAAAAEAs/YCIBxAQnyKw/s1600/DSC_0293.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v5pXoNDFlwg/UigLYHBNKzI/AAAAAAAAEAs/YCIBxAQnyKw/s640/DSC_0293.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">feathers!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />On the day before PAX I also quicked out the triangular ring from Sculpey (also left over from Strength cosplay; thank goodness I can reuse so much stuff) and acrylic paint.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TsVv3uZLfkA/UigL1ImNGlI/AAAAAAAAEA0/6du08qR3d88/s1600/IMG_6350+copy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TsVv3uZLfkA/UigL1ImNGlI/AAAAAAAAEA0/6du08qR3d88/s640/IMG_6350+copy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">photo by <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Sooo overall…though there are a couple things I want to re-do for the next round (including remaking the feather collar and ring), I finished a new cosplay and am proud of my new forays into the world of plastic! PAX itself was fun in and of itself; I was really happy to finally play Transistor, and even more excited for it once I actually played and recognized all the programming nods. I was a little bewildered by the inclusion of the "stop time and attack" thing, until I realized it was <em>so thematic</em> — since the Transistor's atacks are sort of like methods, "stopping time" to queue up attacks and execute them really mirrors compiling programs. <i>Uwaaa.</i><br /><br />I was also surprised and happy to see so many cool Reds at PAX, many of whom had taken the extra leap to use ~*electricity*~! I briefly ran into the Red from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Breakers-Cosplay/419407924815813">Breakers Cosplay</a> who was super impressive and inspiring. I also met a lot of progressive dudes and women who specifically talked about how awesome it is to have A Female Protagonist in a game (something I don't think I would have <em>never</em> heard anyone say flat-out in years past), and a lot of friendly people in general who gamely attempted holding my Transistor and remarked at how they admired my ridiculousness for carrying it around all day at the convention, haha. To be fair, my arms were really sore afterward, but all my rock climbing callouses helped out quite a bit!<br /><br />My favorite moment in all of PAX was to meet Jen Zee, who was so awesome and kind and asked for pictures in which I tried desperately to look cool despite my euphoria. She also gave me a ton of Supergiant swag that I placed all around my house immediately. :')<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uIlReuprg1U/UigMVP6jKFI/AAAAAAAAEA8/kw8k9oCPExI/s1600/DSC_0306.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uIlReuprg1U/UigMVP6jKFI/AAAAAAAAEA8/kw8k9oCPExI/s1600/DSC_0306.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i christen thee, supergiant wall</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There was also a magical instant where A and I, passing curiously by the Paramount, suddenly realized that Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett were performing and dashed inside as quickly as possible and caught <i>the Transistor song</i>!<br /><br />All this being said, I had a great weekend, mostly due to the friends and people I was able to meet. I don't think I feel comfortable enough to return again (because <a href="http://shoshanakessock.com/2013/09/04/pax-youve-gone-and-done-it-an-open-letter/">reasons</a>), but I am thankful for my personal experience this year.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CWR-fH-wYac/UigQ5IFyy7I/AAAAAAAAEBI/GzPz6mXRg3s/s1600/1240322_10151588009897060_1663051843_n_1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="534" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CWR-fH-wYac/UigQ5IFyy7I/AAAAAAAAEBI/GzPz6mXRg3s/s640/1240322_10151588009897060_1663051843_n_1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">especially for time runnin around with <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a>!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And finally, now that both my summer quarter classes and PAX are completely finished, I am free!<br /><br />…and ready to devote myself to a new project! Maybe something for the <a href="http://towerjam.tumblr.com/post/59682821300/welcome-to-tower-jam">Tower Jam</a>?</div>

Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by giants. Giants are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. Love this AoT anime, love the <a href="http://www.cosplayfield.com/attack-on-titan-c-526.html" rel="nofollow">Attack on Titan cosplay costumes</a> in <a href="http://www.cosplayfield.com/" rel="nofollow">www.cosplayfield.com</a>!</div>

For my birthday weekend (some month ago now), I went all-out and scoured my hometown until I found the last remaining Animal Crossing Nintendo 3DS bundle, tucked away in the back of the Toys R Us game section.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I've never played an Animal Crossing game and have to admit that the lack of farming bewildered me. <i>What? How can I really enjoy personalizing and caring for my world if I'm not diligently watering radishes every day? </i>Even when I started, I doubted I would really enjoy playing such a weird-looking human (the eyes too bright; the lower eyelashes so long!) rather than a cool, adorable animal. I started playing and suddenly it was two and a half hours later, exactly. (I know because of the 3DS Activity Log.)</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">So, what <i>is </i>compelling? For me, it's the exploration: being new to the franchise, every swing of the net or fishing pole in the first couple weeks brought me something new and cool to look at, and I imagine this capitalistic wandering is something like what my childhood would have been like if I had been a boy, or allowed outside to play and examine the foliage around my house. Though I'm sure I'll exhaust the novelty at some point, there's also, like Harvest Moon, a sense of <i>ichigo ichie </i>that brings a preciousness even to the cicadas that are fucking everywhere, just because they'll only be here until about mid-September or so — and then I'll have brand new things to check out.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><i>New Leaf </i>also does a fantastic job of connecting you to other people, in part through the capabilities of the 3DS, which I've never appreciated until now. Through the camera, you can share and import designs that other people have made, pixel-art style, including outfits from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-leaf/QR_Codes">Attack on Titan and Zelda</a> games and paths you can lay down to mimic having more&nbsp;<a href="http://newleafpatterns.tumblr.com/post/55173572156">water</a> in your town.</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">Additionally, entire towns or houses can be shared through the "Dreamsuite" or through Streetpass; the former I've used to visit some uncomfortably terrifying towns (such as the infamous Aika and Hitokui), and the latter I'm excited to use each night when I get back home, perusing the homes of people I've passed throughout the day and hoping for good furniture to hoard for rooms I don't have yet. (Thus far I have both a "backyard" room and a "kaitenzushi and pastry restaurant" room planned…)</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4XJdiXu1r8c/Uec75b8J2QI/AAAAAAAADt8/iDV0OAEbbpw/s1600/HNI_0087.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4XJdiXu1r8c/Uec75b8J2QI/AAAAAAAADt8/iDV0OAEbbpw/s1600/HNI_0087.JPG" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">hito in...hitokui @__@<br />("kui" means "to eat")</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">Part of this novelty is the 3DS's Streetpass itself — my digital headnod at the three people I Streetpass every morning on the bus — and part of it is just the weird delight of meeting people backward and inside-out — knowing, for example, that a fellow commuter is a strict interior designer and Nintendo fan (as shown by their vivid prize room), or that another also loves Attack on Titan (as shown by their "Scouting Legion" painting), before I know either of their names or genders.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I'm not too much of a social gamer — I don't like playing competitively, and prefer to play games when I am completely alone — but I appreciate this variety of socialness, or rather not-aloneness, a way to get to interact with and get to know people in a low-stress, low-troll atmosphere.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I've started reserving&nbsp;<a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/">my Tumblr</a> for more "slice of life" updates and it's there that you can find more <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/acnl">screenshots of my Shiba adventures</a>, as well as my encounters with my villagers, who are acquiring quite the vocabulary.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gxj-vKhwHM8/Uec6tGQ5r7I/AAAAAAAADtw/GsYAGZyo68M/s1600/tumblr_moxg28e8Tq1qdycalo1_400.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gxj-vKhwHM8/Uec6tGQ5r7I/AAAAAAAADtw/GsYAGZyo68M/s1600/tumblr_moxg28e8Tq1qdycalo1_400.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Julian is my favorite villager</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
