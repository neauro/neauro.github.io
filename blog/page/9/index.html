On the recommendation of my friend, I checked out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312362919/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312362919&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day</a>&nbsp;from the library and attempted its secrets.<br /><br />Having never made bread before and heard much of the difficulty of doing so, I was pretty skeptical. In the end it did not, in fact, take me five minutes, but forty or so minutes (from &#8220;cloaking&#8221; the bread to throwing it in the oven to eating it with delight) is not that bad.<br /><br />My first attempt was remarkably crusty and white and fluffy inside.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JNgwvcLgeaQ/UHIMz0kzc1I/AAAAAAAACoM/ROtgu_MxL98/s1600/goodbread.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JNgwvcLgeaQ/UHIMz0kzc1I/AAAAAAAACoM/ROtgu_MxL98/s640/goodbread.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">WHOA. did i really do that?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My second attempt was crusted with soot as black as midnight and filled the entire house with smoke besides. But, the inside was still white and fluffy!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Uq0DV5pgJFE/UHIM-t_m0cI/AAAAAAAACoU/5Y8NfxOumXU/s1600/bread.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="346" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Uq0DV5pgJFE/UHIM-t_m0cI/AAAAAAAACoU/5Y8NfxOumXU/s640/bread.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">and edible!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Another first for me was creating pancakes from a macadamia-nut studded mix.

Obedient, passionate, and committed to her country, she is being groomed for success in the Republics highest circles.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Born into the slums of the Republic&#8217;s Lake Sector, fifteen-year-old Day is the country&#8217;s most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths &#8211; until the day June&#8217;s brother, Metias, is murdered, and Day becomes the prime suspect. Now, caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family&#8217;s survival, while June tries desperately to avenge Metias&#8217;s death.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>But in a shocking turn of events, the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths to which their country will go to keep its secrets.</i></blockquote><br />I tore through this book like Oreo cheesecake (which is, not un-coincidentally, my favorite type of cheesecake, which is in turn my favorite type of cake). It contained all my favorite ingredients: dystopian surroundings (also known as a delicious yet crumbly crust), two main characters who are &#8220;specialists&#8221; at their game (the sugar),  who are additionally enemies of each other <em>and also love interests ahhhh</em> (the cheese).<br /><br />That being said, though I enjoyed reading it, there were things that could have been better. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any real purpose to why the Republic is in a dystopian/corrupt state, only some hand-waving about factions like &#8220;the Colonies&#8221; and the &#8220;Patriots,&#8221; all of whom struggle against one another for vague territorial reasons. The youth of the Republic are all forced to go through &#8220;Trials&#8221; to determine their future, but there&#8217;s no strong underlying reason <em>why</em>. Occasionally there are references to a mysterious pre-dystopian country regarded with awe &#8211; a flag comprised of thirteen red and white stripes with fifty dots on a blue rectangle, an ancient coin that reads <em>In God We Trust</em> &#8211; but that&#8217;s about it. Why are people fighting for this by-gone era? Why are they regarding old quarters as precious? I guess we&#8217;ll figure out in the next book?<br /><br />Another thing: one of the characters later is revealed to have a &#8220;dominant ethnicity&#8221; of &#8220;Mongolian,&#8221; but is still blonde-haired and blue-eyed, which is bewildering to say the least. I&#8217;m not saying that Asian people are never born without blonde hair or blue eyes, but given the context of this book in its genre and in our society, where Asian people are often absent or played by white people, this particular Mongolian character ends up feeling uncomfortably &#8220;exotic.&#8221;<br /><br />The book is told from the alternating first-person perspectives of &#8220;June&#8221; and &#8220;Day,&#8221; which was okay, though both characters are so similar that I&#8217;m not sure I would have been able to tell them apart if the font face and color hadn&#8217;t also alternated with each voice. A significant feature of both characters is their extreme attention to detail, which is fun, but also feels misused at times; there must have been at least three people which were noted as left-handed, not because left-handedness meant anything, but just to illustrate <em>again</em> how observative the main characters were, in case you&#8217;d forgotten. Aside from that, the story is easy to read, and filled with tasty drama.<br /><br />In conclusion: Legend is good cheesecake.</div>

I went with Selesnya because of course. Playstyle-wise (and flavor-wise), I resonate with it more. Plus I love the security of green&#8217;s fixing.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uBFjufDIWRo/UGj3cpTY-kI/AAAAAAAACkk/CsSHHZ4wVDA/s1600/selesnya.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="556" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uBFjufDIWRo/UGj3cpTY-kI/AAAAAAAACkk/CsSHHZ4wVDA/s640/selesnya.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">for the conclave!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I have to say I <i>really</i>&nbsp;enjoyed the set-up of RTR&#8217;s pre-release, especially with the boxes and stickers and even a free little spin-down in guild colors (which I unfortunately lost somehow after my last match :( ). Izzet and Golgari were the first sold out at the pre-release that I attended, though I was so sure people would be eating up <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=archon+of+the+triumvirate&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">the Azorius promo</a>. Selesnya and Rakdos were left for last, but after having the opportunity to play against all the guilds, Rakdos really seems to be the strongest in this format, to me, given that it can make use of <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=carnival+hellsteed&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Carnival Hellsteed</a> right off the bat (attacking as a&nbsp;<i>first strike 6/5 wat</i>), has many not-bad commons, and can even make use of Golgari&#8217;s scavenge creatures (imagine scavenging counters onto <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=270349">Daggerdrome Imp</a> or something&#8230;wah!)<br /><br />My decklist:<br /><br /><i>Creatures</i><br />2x Azorius Arrester<br />2x Centaur&#8217;s Herald<br />2x Centaur Healer<br />2x Gatecreeper Vine<br />1x Fencing Ace<br />1x Seller of Songbirds<br />1x Rubbleback Rhino<br /><i><br /></i><i>Spells/Artifacts</i><br />1x Street Spasm<br />1x Druid&#8217;s Deliverance<br />2x Trostani&#8217;s Judgment<br />1x Eyes in the Skies<br />1x Coursers&#8217; Accord<br />1x Call of the Conclave<br />1x Mana Bloom<br />1x Avenging Arrow<br />1x Explosive Impact<br />1x Sundering Growth<br />1x Seek the Horizon<br />1x Collective Blessing (mwahaha)<br />1x Izzet Keyrune<br /><br /><i>Land/Gates</i><br />5x Forest<br />4x Plains<br />1x Mountain<br />2x Selesnya Guildgate<br />2x Transguild Promenade<br />1x Izzet Guildgate<br />1x Grove of the Guardian<br /><i><br /></i>Populate is <i>so fun</i>. Out of all of the pre-release promos, <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=grove+of+the+guardian&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Grove of the Guardian</a> definitely felt like it was the one with the most synergy with its colors and keywords. The number of times I was able to pop and then populate an 8/8 token and was not insubstantial. And once I managed it, no one was able to bring it/them down, though one Golgari opponent kept fishing for his <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=abrupt+decay&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Abrupt Decay</a>, in vain. I&#8217;m glad that I decided to stick straight with a populate theme, though cracking a <a href="http://magiccards.info/rtr/en/183.html">Niv-Mizzet</a> in my first pack and an <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=epic+experiment&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Epic Experiment</a> in my second did make it so I was <i>really</i>&nbsp;tempted to splash both red and blue, which I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t.<br /><br />Something I missed was the keywords for RTR playing into some world story. Innistrad&#8217;s keywords (transforming, morbid, etc.) really spoke to the general atmosphere of the world and its creatures, as well as providing interesting play. I guess the &#8220;story&#8221; of RTR really may just involve guilds all fighting each other, but it would be nice if there was something a little more than that, which you can soak up without delving into pages of a wiki.<br /><br />I ended up going three and one, and drew a Trostani in one of my reward packs!

Ever since Leilani told me about them, I&#8217;ve been absolutely obsessed with doing <em>vermicompost</em>, aka getting a box, filling it with worms, and leaving my organic materials in there to rot and be eaten and transformed into ~*castings*~ after about six months.<br /><br />Step 1: Get the box. In this case, two Rubbermaid boxes into which were easily drilled rows and columns of holes. The holey one is meant for the worms; the one without the holes is meant to gather what I believe some people refer to as &#8220;worm tea.&#8221;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9kSBfcX8CpE/UGaJA8WN0hI/AAAAAAAACjM/vQv6hzFzpR0/s1600/DSC_0001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9kSBfcX8CpE/UGaJA8WN0hI/AAAAAAAACjM/vQv6hzFzpR0/s400/DSC_0001.jpg" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">break out that drill</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Step 2: Get and prepare the&nbsp;bedding&nbsp; Actually, I got the worms first before preparing the&nbsp;bedding&nbsp; which consisted of an issue of Real Change and some pages from The Stranger (torn haphazardly into one-inch, stripper-ad-covered strips), and a bunch of old peanut shells and bok choy ends from that night&#8217;s <a href="http://rasamalaysia.com/recipe-kung-pao-chicken/2/">dinner</a>. Because worms thrive in a wet environment, you&#8217;re supposed to <a href="http://organicgardening.about.com/od/compost/ss/setupawormbin_4.htm">soak the papers until they feel like a damp sponge</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7YUalRY0ACc/UGaJCEJFC9I/AAAAAAAACjk/qiCVGrlvrXg/s1600/worms.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7YUalRY0ACc/UGaJCEJFC9I/AAAAAAAACjk/qiCVGrlvrXg/s640/worms.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">worms and bedding</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Step 3: Once the beddings are prepared, put in the worms! We got these worms from <a href="http://www.stonewayhardware.com/">Stoneway Hardware</a>, which seemed to be one of the few places in Seattle that have them in supply. At first glance the canister seemed full of dirt, but after curiously (and then furiously) drumming out the clump of soil from the bottom of the canister, we stared in shock and not a little abrupt nausea at the wriggly, thrashing mass.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q4-AEPVyFg4/UGaJBkon9OI/AAAAAAAACjc/Cc0qV_eLn4E/s1600/wormbin.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q4-AEPVyFg4/UGaJBkon9OI/AAAAAAAACjc/Cc0qV_eLn4E/s640/wormbin.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">worms!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />They thrashed away from the light, some of them so vehemently that they fell down the drill holes and had to be rescued and placed back amidst the feast. We then covered the tub with a thin layer of <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/autumn-perennial-planting.html">compost</a> (having heard that compost can be full of helpful microbes) and placed it lovingly inside an empty cabinet for easy disposal of plant-based debris.<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard to say what really attracted me to vermicompost, but I guess it&#8217;s the idea that you&#8217;re <em>closing the circle</em> &#8211; putting some of your food to the creatures who will help you convert it into stuff to help more plant foods grow. I guess it doesn&#8217;t hurt that I really enjoy taking care of things in general, especially when &#8220;taking care of things&#8221; consists of placing a bok choy end in a cabinet every now and then.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CExg13WO2sg/UGaJBJdqisI/AAAAAAAACjU/31e28x48Grw/s1600/cabinet.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CExg13WO2sg/UGaJBJdqisI/AAAAAAAACjU/31e28x48Grw/s400/cabinet.jpg" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">thar be worms</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
This past week has been busy with moving, the start of my new job, and the start of autumn quarter, but at some point we finally found time to plant the starters that we (well, I) bought (starry-eyed) at various nurseries.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve spent the past couple weeks reading books to raise my gardening level a little higher  before attempting The Real Thing. Library discoveries include <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046HAJ9K/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0046HAJ9K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Talking Dirt</a></em> by Annie Spiegelman, and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1604692200/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1604692200&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Decoding Gardening Advice: The Science Behind the 100 Most Common Recommendations</a></em>, by Jeff Gillman and Meleah Maynard. Both are incredibly readable and filled with great beginner information, especially for someone like me, who scarce knew the difference compost and mulch. Yes, they are different! And they do different things! Whoa! Both books are also incredibly forgiving and advise constant questioning of advice and continued experimentation and learning. So&#8230;here we go!<br /><br />Now knowing that &#8220;compost&#8221; is something which can be added to the dirt of places to make it all-around better for plant growth, we purchased some large bags and amended the beds around the back of the house, which (though covered appealing rich brown mulch) proved to be mostly rocky, pale dirt. Thereafter we planted some packets of seeds that seem to be ready to plant at about this time: overwintering carrots, swiss chard, spinach, cilantro. I am wary of seeds, especially since we just planted them straight in rather than growing them indoors beneath a light or something first, but I guess we&#8217;ll see what happens with these.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_6POawL7UHs/UGaD1ijHJQI/AAAAAAAACh0/aF87yH46bF8/s1600/dirt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_6POawL7UHs/UGaD1ijHJQI/AAAAAAAACh0/aF87yH46bF8/s640/dirt.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dat compost</td></tr></tbody></table><br />We also transplanted <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/things-ive-learned-about-my-new.html">that blueberry bush</a>, which had &#8211; since the time I bought it &#8211; started exhibiting an alarming amount of yellowing leaves, as well as leaves that curled at their edges and became a pale brick-red color that was soft to the touch. Maybe scorch? Maybe a fungus? Maybe a canker? Maybe the effect of general nutrients or acidity leaking from its black gallon pot? In any case, we transplanted it into a corner of the beds with some scoops of azalea/rhododendron fertilizer to make up for any acidity the soil may not have, since I was a bad gardener and haven&#8217;t checked the pH yet&#8230;I was too nervous of leaving it to wilt further in that container.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCFJTyJfdXA/UGaD0vaYXQI/AAAAAAAAChk/UPMkWr-QYvY/s1600/blueberry.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCFJTyJfdXA/UGaD0vaYXQI/AAAAAAAAChk/UPMkWr-QYvY/s640/blueberry.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sorry, blueberry plant :(</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It&#8217;s had some new young leaves since this last photo, which hopefully grew not just because of the burst of nitrogen in the fertilizer, which apparently can cause new growth that then just dies in winter because it isn&#8217;t strong enough to withstand the cold. (Which is why fertilizers should be applied in spring, I suppose. Then again, another part of one of these books says it&#8217;s best to plant perennials in autumn, when hot weather isn&#8217;t there to stress them into not forming good roots&#8230;ahh!)<br /><br />One thing learned from these books is that, when buying perennials, it&#8217;s better to choose a small, unblooming candidate. Small plants are better able to withstand transplanting, and if they don&#8217;t yet have blooms, they can focus more of their energy on growing strong roots. It&#8217;s also important to make sure that plants aren&#8217;t&nbsp;root-bound,&nbsp;which can be checked by tipping the plant out of its pot and making sure the roots are white, not encircling the pot, and not smelly.<br /><br />Anyway, one of the new starters we got was a lemon balm.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-saSzMt32Ewk/UGaD2mNrhpI/AAAAAAAACiE/xUQsOrmTFUM/s1600/lemonbalm.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-saSzMt32Ewk/UGaD2mNrhpI/AAAAAAAACiE/xUQsOrmTFUM/s640/lemonbalm.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small; text-align: start;">lovely smelly smell</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Lemonbalm is part of the mint family, and is fragrant as all hell. You only need to touch the stems or leaves to have your hands come away with an inexplicably lemony and lovely aroma. It&#8217;s apparently quite easy to take care of (even to the point of growing flush with more pruning?). For now it&#8217;s by the front door so that we can grope it every time we leave.<br /><br />Beside it is a rosemary because of course.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FttRcXtdwa8/UGaD3WJ-MKI/AAAAAAAACiM/qvViGHxF1Gs/s1600/rosemary.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FttRcXtdwa8/UGaD3WJ-MKI/AAAAAAAACiM/qvViGHxF1Gs/s640/rosemary.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">like duh</td></tr></tbody></table><br />They&#8217;re hardy enough that they grow on sidewalks here, tempting passersby to take a sprig despite the likelihood of such a sidewalk denizen having been&nbsp;anointed&nbsp;with pesticides or (worse) dog pee. In any case, rosemary always struck me as an uncomplaining garden occupant with the advantage of yielding omelette-friendly seasoning.<br /><br />Beside <em>that</em> is a stout chocolate mint, which some years ago I had tried to grow on a windowsill, to no avail. These seem a bit more sturdy than my previous twig of a chocolate mint, so here&#8217;s hoping the mint family is as vigorous as people complain about, and can withstand my less-than-masterful attempts to support its survival.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C0zBJTfrP38/UGaD1BZFGbI/AAAAAAAAChs/xrVn2y7n1bM/s1600/chocomint.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C0zBJTfrP38/UGaD1BZFGbI/AAAAAAAAChs/xrVn2y7n1bM/s640/chocomint.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">good luck, little one</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The last plant we planted in was an agatasche, or &#8220;hummingbird mint,&#8221; which can possibly attract hummingbirds, if they indeed exist here.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6qsoAsvB9eQ/UGaD0G7GYwI/AAAAAAAAChc/WHtiv-L-F-k/s1600/agastache.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6qsoAsvB9eQ/UGaD0G7GYwI/AAAAAAAAChc/WHtiv-L-F-k/s640/agastache.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i think i saw one here once?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In general it was an attractive enough plant that I decided to forego my want of only edible gardening plants to obtain it. Presently it&#8217;s planted in the bed around the monkey-tail tree, which makes me a little nervous since one of the things these books said was, <em>Don&#8217;t raise a garden around the trunk of the tree!</em> This can apparently smother the roots there, and can lead to a greater chance of diseases or fungi attacking the tree. I believe that this garden was placed around the tree to make the house look pretty before we moved in, but Andou doesn&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s large enough to really harm the tree. I hope so, because the tree is so large and beautiful that it would be a shame if it died&#8230;<br /><br />So, yeah, anyway, to be honest I didn&#8217;t really check the rootbounded-ness of any of these perennials, nor am I entirely sure, having already planted them, whether they were overly-rootbound or not&#8230;but as of this morning they were still alive, so, that&#8217;s good.<br /><br />While digging up the front beds to place in new plants, we ended up unearthing some mysterious bulbs which look a lot like garlic but may not be. Planted here by previous tenants perhaps? Some of them were sadly crushed, but I&#8217;ll re-plant them once the earth cools down a little and I&#8217;m ready to plant some tulips I received as a gift.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi_JALLdVAI/UGaD2Bn8rCI/AAAAAAAACh8/7rwT0jBdT6E/s1600/garlic.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi_JALLdVAI/UGaD2Bn8rCI/AAAAAAAACh8/7rwT0jBdT6E/s640/garlic.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">we&#8217;ll see what occurs later</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></div>

Compared to Tumblr, it&#8217;s something that fell short of my &#8221;<a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/09/habit-zone.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NirAndFar+%28Nir+and+Far+Blog%29">habit zone</a>,&#8221; maybe because I felt less of a community there, or because the cascading photos serve so much better the action of basking in the beauty of something for three seconds before moving onto the next Amazing Thing That I Want to Try (like <i><a href="http://www.17apart.com/2012/02/how-to-grow-green-onions-indefinitely.html">growing green onions indefinitely</a>, WHOA</i>. Though, apparently the onions only last about 3 or 4 more chops, and get pretty bland). Compare to Tumblr, where the single-column feed of media encourages you to stay, and to read, and to discuss, at least a <i>little</i>&nbsp;longer.<br /><br />Something that Pinterest has about Tumblr is the sense of organization &#8211; my storage of links on Tumblr just gets larger and longer and harder to parse, especially with the overhead of adding tags (which may not match tags I already made, and which I might not have added at all, out of laziness). In contrast, organization in the form of boards is Pinterest&#8217;s foundation, and it also very easily keeps tracks of images and their source links for you. It&#8217;s also easy to skim even huge piles for what you want, or easy to just skim them with a smug sense of satisfaction at your gathered knowledge.<br /><br />Pinterest! The best way to visually organize cross-platform bookmarks in a way that makes you feel as productive as if you had actually been doing all the DIY things you&#8217;re marking to do Later.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So at the end of last May, I acquired a pair of air plants from a street fair, both of them mid-bloom. The one on the left is, I think, some kind of <i>Tillandsia&nbsp;stricta</i> (maybe the &#8221;<i>stricta rio</i>&#8221;?). I&#8217;m pretty sure the one on the right is <i>Tillandsia ionantha.</i><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zBiiauAqi3A/UE5Ia1nN2wI/AAAAAAAACdU/1yIk4UawYfQ/s1600/tillandsia1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zBiiauAqi3A/UE5Ia1nN2wI/AAAAAAAACdU/1yIk4UawYfQ/s640/tillandsia1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i left the flowers on even after they died because i thought it they still looked a little festive&#8230;</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After I bought them I started looking up how to take care of them, and was a disappointed that many websites say that air plants are monocarpic, meaning they flower once and die. (That&#8217;s what I get from picking the prettiest plants from the bargain bin, I guess.)<br /><br />Other things learned about air plants at the time:<br /><br /><ul><li>they need watering about once a week</li><li>though you can mist them to water them, it&#8217;s better to just dunk them underneath a sink to soak them them all the way through</li><li>air plant roots are primarily used for holding onto things, not for absorbing water</li><li>make sure to shake plants so they don&#8217;t have water pooling in crevices or near roots</li><li>hard water, which has a lot of minerals, can clog up the filaments in tillandsia leaves that draw in the plant&#8217;s nutrients; luckily, Pacific Northwest tap water is some of the softest water in the US ;D</li><li>filtered light (which is sunlight that goes through some sort of filter, like a window), is best</li><li>after air plants flower, they may reproduce, creating a new offset which is called a &#8220;pup&#8221;</li></ul><div><br />So I guess the plants might &#8220;pup&#8221;? I started a (somewhat inconsistent) regimen of dunk-watering about once a week. Four months later, I<i>&nbsp;</i>abruptly realized that my air plants <i>are</i>&nbsp;having pups!</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8230;I think? In any case, the <i>stricta</i> appears to have a little dent in its clutch of spiny leaves where something looks to be emerging:</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9e7VYtF_2uo/UE5Qp_Y7SmI/AAAAAAAACeU/HTakw2cvUn0/s1600/tillandsia2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9e7VYtF_2uo/UE5Qp_Y7SmI/AAAAAAAACeU/HTakw2cvUn0/s640/tillandsia2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">it&#8217;s a little blurry&#8230;</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After searching for a similar dent in the <i>ionata</i>, I realized that it the whole thing was in fact quickly becoming two plants:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-47Vq3KXPhwU/UE5RPuJm6DI/AAAAAAAACec/z605d1A5X6U/s1600/tillandsia3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-47Vq3KXPhwU/UE5RPuJm6DI/AAAAAAAACec/z605d1A5X6U/s640/tillandsia3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">near my thumb there!</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Hurray :)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.justairplants.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=68">It seems</a> that you can separate pups from the mother plant after they are about 1/2 or a 1/3 the size of the parent, but I&#8217;m not sure if I will yet. It also seems that plants show &#8220;an&nbsp;exaggeration&nbsp;of the natural curvation of their leaves&#8221; if they don&#8217;t have enough water so&#8230;oops. @__@ I thought these curves were pretty attractive but I guess I should soak these plants overnight. Which seems like it would kill them, but I haven&#8217;t found a source yet that says air plants are capable of being overwatered.<br /><br />Finding a book about air plants would be better than the soup of websites I&#8217;ve been finding, but I haven&#8217;t yet discovered one. Another book I&#8217;d like to find: one that discusses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marimo">marimo</a>, my newest &#8220;easy to care for living thing&#8221; interest.</div>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-S3g0jRylQ1A/UE4fWvHOgMI/AAAAAAAACbc/JITahodS8LA/s1600/ravnica.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="514" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-S3g0jRylQ1A/UE4fWvHOgMI/AAAAAAAACbc/JITahodS8LA/s640/ravnica.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of <a href="http://guildsofravnica.com/">guildsofravnica.com</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I&#8217;ve been following the developments of the new block of Magic cards, my fervor for them having not waned with the passing of werewolf creatures. It helps that the next block is Ravnica, which I had always admired for its gorgeous lands; an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenopolis">ecumenopolis</a>, it&#8217;s the sort of world I would be hard-pressed to find alternatives for (unlike Innistrad&#8217;s &#8220;gothic horror&#8221; world, for example).<br /><br />One social network advertising construct that WOTC is employing to hype up the release is this <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/leaderboard">guild leaderboard</a>&nbsp;thing where you can join a guild of your choice and start earning points for it by participating in certain activities, like answering daily online quizzes. &#8220;Which card art has better sound effects?&#8221; &#8220;Which card art is better for doing chores?&#8221;<br /><br />Here&#8217;s an unattractive but functional pie chart of the current points breakdown:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kw0fBjSarQQ/UE4iFz6D0SI/AAAAAAAACcY/MBqAXxsOsNQ/s1600/ravnicapoints.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="341" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kw0fBjSarQQ/UE4iFz6D0SI/AAAAAAAACcY/MBqAXxsOsNQ/s400/ravnicapoints.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">with bonus mismatched guild colors, aaahhh</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It&#8217;s cute and interesting how the top four guilds (red/blue Izzet, white/blue Azorious, blue/black Dimir, and blue/green Simic) all have blue. Assuming that the majority of people joined guilds thinking, <i>Yes, this guild personifies me,</i>&nbsp;does this mean that Magic players tend towards self-identifying as blue, which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering#Colors_of_Magic">Wikipedia</a> reminds me is &#8220;the color of intellect, reason, illusion, logic, knowledge, manipulation, and trickery&#8221;? I guess it makes sense &#8211; I mean, you&#8217;d imagine that a strategic trading card game would draw in people really into logic/knowledge/manipulation/trickery/etc.<br /><br />If the most popular guilds are the ones that Magic players might see their own characteristics in, then what are the characteristics that players <i>don&#8217;t</i>&nbsp;identify with, the ones of the least popular guilds? (Where &#8220;popularity&#8221; means not just joining the guild, but adoring it enough to complete arbitrary online activities for it?)<br /><br />Third from last, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/orzhov">Orzhov</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The Orzhov guild is founded on the beliefs that <b>wealth is power</b>, that structure breeds wealth, and that guilt creates structure. The guild is run like a combination <b>religion, credit-lending agency, and crime syndicate</b>. [&#8230;] Most Ravnicans see the Orzhov for the <b>corrupt organization</b> they are, but many are lured in by their promises of wealth, prestige, and longevity.</i></blockquote><br />Second from last, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/rakdos">Rakdos</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The Rakdos Cult is a large group of hedonists, <b>sadists, criminals, and psychopaths</b>&#8230;&nbsp;[&#8230;]The Rakdos Cult combines an instinctual bloodlust and desire for power. They’re sadistic and cruel simply for the fun of it. <b>Opportunistic violence</b> is their modus operandi. Mayhem and personal enjoyment is their goal&#8230;</i></blockquote><br />And finally, the Very Last, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/gruul">Gruul</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The Gruul are a loose affiliation of <b>savage clans who squat in Ravnica’s alleyways</b>, abandoned zones, and overgrown ruins. [&#8230;] Warfare among the Gruul is constant and almost ritualistic; the Gruul believe that <b>only the strong should survive and rule</b>. The Gruul are the most <b>anti-civilization</b> and <b>disenfranchised</b> of all of Ravnica’s guilds, and as such are the most ill at ease in a world covered by city.</i></blockquote><br />I guess it&#8217;s nice that the guilds that are flat-out described as being filled with sadists and criminals are the least popular? And maybe the unpopularity of Orzhov is a sort of Occupy Ravnica thing? It&#8217;s a little saddening to me that Gruul is the least popular, though. Out of the three of last-placers, it&#8217;s the one that doesn&#8217;t outright use negative words like &#8220;corrupt&#8221; or &#8220;violence;&#8221; on the whole, Gruul seems to embody poverty (&#8220;squat in Ravnica&#8217;s alleyways;&#8221; &#8220;disenfranchised&#8221;) and &#8220;savageness,&#8221; which historically is used to point at people and say, &#8220;You don&#8217;t know the same things I know and deem important; therefore, you are unintelligent and backward (and I&#8217;m never going to join your guild)!&#8221;<br /><br />Then again, it could just be a flavor thing; out of all the guilds, even to me Gruul seems unimaginative, compared to, say, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/izzet">Izzet</a>, which was intended to &#8220;provide solutions for public works projects (sewers, boilers, roadways), but&#8230;often produce mana geysers, spatial rifts, or arcane portals instead.&#8221;<br /><br />Anyway~ After taking the quiz myself, I ended up as <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/selesnya">Selesnya</a>. After taking the quiz a second time, I ended up <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/simic">Simic</a>. Since both are sort of nature-y and less manifest destiny then the other guilds, I have to say neither of these results were unexpected. The flavor pages for both guilds also feature mostly women characters, which is pretty cool. Selesnya even has <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/images/guildquiz/guildpage/GuildImage_Selesnya_03.jpg">a non-white-looking humanoid creature</a>! (I&#8217;m still waiting for a non-white human creature; apparently, despite being denizens of <i>an entire planet</i>&nbsp;converted into a city, all humans are white. Shrug. Sigh.)</div>
