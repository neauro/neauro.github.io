Now award-winning author Mark Kurlansky tells the remarkable story of New York by following the trajectory of one of its most fascinating inhabitants &#8211; the oyster, whose influence on the great metropolis remains unparalleled.<br /><br />For centuries New York was famous for its oysters, which until the early 1900s played such a dominant role in the city&#8217;s economy, gastronomy, and ecology that the abundant bivalves were Gotham&#8217;s most celebrated export, a staple food for the wealthy, the poor, and tourists alike, and the primary natural defense against pollution for the city&#8217;s congested waterways.<br /><br />Filled with cultural, historical, and culinary insight &#8211; along with historic recipes, maps, drawings, and photos &#8211; this dynamic narrative sweeps readers from the island hunting ground of the Lenape Indians to the death of the oyster beds at the rise of America&#8217;s environmentalist movement, from the oyster cellars of the rough-and-tumble Five Points slums to Manhattan&#8217;s poshest Gilded Age dining chambers.</i></blockquote><br />Reading history in general is a lot more palatable to me when it anchors itself on a single thing, especially if that thing is a food item (haha?). As such, I picked up&nbsp;<i>The Big Oyster:</i>&nbsp;a history of New York that revolves around a bivalve that apparently was once so populous there that people were like, &#8220;Oh, well, if poor people can&#8217;t afford to buy food, at least they can just dredge up oysters to eat!&#8221;<br /><br />It&#8217;s a book that made me wince at every page with the sheer amount of environmental pollution that people are willing to inflict on their environments, especially when the feedback of such destructive actions isn&#8217;t clear enough (like if all your sewage sinks into the bay, below sight&#8230;and right on the oyster beds). Consider &#8220;the Collect:&#8221;<br /><br /><blockquote><i>This pond where the Lenape [Native Americans] once fished, where the Dutch picnicked on an adjacent hill to have a view of it, was becoming a mucky, malarial swamp, strewn with trash and festering with disease.</i></blockquote><br />Or the quality of water in Manhattan:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Also, the city was running out of fresh water. The drinking water came from local wells that caught the rainwater that washed down the foul streets. By midcentury, the quality of Manhattan water had become so bad that out-of-town horses refused to drink it.</i></blockquote><br />Or what happened after the American Revolution:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Discarded trash would start to fill in around the piers and merchants, rather than cleaning it out, would extend the docks farther out and finish filling in the trash area with landfill until they had added several blocks to lower Manhattan at the expense of the East River, the harbor, and the Hudson.</i></blockquote><br />AAAAHHHH ;____;<br /><br />Something else that I appreciated about the book was that it didn&#8217;t stick strictly to the history of white settlers to New York, but also discussed the activities of people of color.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The first black in Manhattan was an explorer named Jan Rodrigues who came on a Dutch ship in 1613 [&#8230;] By the 1630s, a free black community had been established north of the pond. By 1750, Manhattan was 18 percent black, comparable to today&#8217;s ratio.</i></blockquote><br />And, did you know about Thomas Downing, who owned the Downing&#8217;s restaurant from 1830 to 1860, New York&#8217;s &#8220;most celebrated oyster cellar,&#8221; which catered Charles Dickens&#8217; visit to the United States? Downing also sent oysters to Queen Victoria, which she repaid by giving him a gold watch. Pretty cooool.<br /><br />There&#8217;s also notes made of women; here&#8217;s one concerning the opening of the Delmonica cafe, around 1824:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>For Americans, the initial curiosity of was the first female cashier they had ever seen, a new concept, entrusting women with money.</i></blockquote><br />That&#8217;s less than <i>200 years ago</i>. Also happening around this time: not women, but men doing grocery shopping and bringing the bags home. Because, as one man put it, &#8220;The man who was ashamed to carry home his dinner didn&#8217;t deserve any.&#8221; (Also, I guess men could more easily wade through the filth of the marketplaces, as they are socialized to wear trousers rather than long dresses. See how sexism hurts everybody?)<br /><br />There are, of course, a fair share of interesting oyster tidbits:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Producers discovered that oysters are educable. The grower would choose plump, large oysters and replant them closer to shore where they would be exposed for a few hours a day in low tide. After a few days, they would move the oysters a little farther up so that they were exposed for a few minutes longer in low tides. [&#8230;] The oysters learned to take a long hard drink before the water retreated and eventually would hold the water the entire time they were exposed.</i></blockquote>In conclusion: fun, easy to read, informative, inclusive.</div>

But beauty comes with a hidden price tag. Is Sara willing to pay?</i></blockquote><br />I was happy to rediscover Sara&#8217;s Face in one of my tubs of books in the garage. It&#8217;s a book that I scavenged from some many hundreds expelled from the city library, and I decided it was mine after I read the words <i>face transplant</i>.<br /><br />The book is written as if by a novelist playing the role of a journalist. He or she dissects the grosteque and still-mysterious events surrounding Jonathan Heat, an aging rockstar invested in his looks, and Sara Carter, a 17-year-old girl who wants to become famous, in a Manic-Pixie-Dream-Girl sort of way. <br /><br /><blockquote><i>It&#8217;s like, when people look at you and think, </i>Oh, she&#8217;s smaller than in real life,<i> because, see, actually, you&#8217;re not real life. It&#8217;s when people start talking to you in the street or on the bus because they think they know you, but they never even met you, or like you&#8217;ve got some secret they want to know but they never can. Like you&#8217;re a blessing. There&#8217;s something about you that inspires them to be more than themselves. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s what I want to be. Just like that.</i></blockquote><br />The book is written as if the event&#8217;s conclusion has already been well-disseminated amongst its fictional UK populace, and in some ways, you as the reader can have some very well-founded suspicions of What Happens at the End as well. Does that mean that the book isn&#8217;t exciting? I once read a blog post about writing (which I can&#8217;t find at the moment) which stated that, No, just knowing the ending isn&#8217;t enough to spoil the story; and in fact, sometimes knowing it full-out keeps you crawling toward it like a desperate person. &#8220;Have you ever heard of the time that I got shot?&#8221; Person X might say, and upon you replying, <i>No! Tell me about it,</i> Person X might answer, &#8220;Well, I wasn&#8217;t actually shot, but I certainly got you interested.&#8221;<br /><br />So &#8211; you kinda sorta maybe know what&#8217;s going to happen &#8211; kinda sorta? Maybe? Even so, I was engrossed in the proceedings as if they were happening &#8220;now,&#8221; as if the characters recounting their actions still had no idea what was going to happen. Every character offered in the story is meaningful, and full of motivation, action, and regret. The writing is easy to digest, straightforward, and full of punch. It takes only a couple sentences to understand who a character is.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>I need new tits. I need a whole new body, actually. I tell you, I get fatter when I&#8217;m dieting. I get fat just by breathing. I can turn air into fat. It&#8217;s a gift I have.</i></blockquote><br />Though the book is supposed to have been written by &#8220;a journalist,&#8221; occasionally things are portrayed with novelist-like omniscience:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>There was another huge bang, a bellow as if the Minotaur himself was coming, and then a man&#8217;s voice speaking out urgently but low, the words too blurred to make out. Then, there came the sound of a girl suddenly screaming in pain. It was truly dreadful, a cawing, screeching noise that [Sara] understood was coming from a pretty young throat.</i></blockquote><br />In this scene, only Sara is able to hear the screaming, and Sara hasn&#8217;t told her story to the journalist yet at this point; so why does the journalist detail it? For me, these small strangenesses were only very small bumps in the road; overall the book kept me ravenous to learn What Happens Next, and it was only grudgingly that I put it away to get some sleep, only to pick it up again at 6am to finish it.</div>

<br />Now that I&#8217;m moving into a place with a yard (!!), I&#8217;ve been eagerly making lists of easy and functional plants to attempt raising, such as rosemary, lavender, and mint. But then I saw blueberry plants at the farmer&#8217;s market! And I remembered that a blueberry bush subsists in my childhood home, which means it&#8217;s grown and borne fruit despite being under the care of a family with only a mildly green (like let&#8217;s say <span style="color: #78ab46;">#78AB46</span>) thumb.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-afLO_FHRiSE/UEUCkMAIZ-I/AAAAAAAACXg/aG6dEvq1rhs/s1600/blueberry.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-afLO_FHRiSE/UEUCkMAIZ-I/AAAAAAAACXg/aG6dEvq1rhs/s640/blueberry.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">blueberryyyy</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This is what I&#8217;ve learned thus far about blueberry plant care from the farmer who sold me the plant, as well as a variety of internet sources:<br /><ol><li>Fertilizer meant for azaleas and rhododendrons is best for blueberries, presumably because it is acidic, and acidity is what blueberries like. Also good: peat moss.</li><li>No chicken manure! (&#8220;It&#8217;s too sweet for them.&#8221;)</li><li>Blueberries like their soil kept moist, and like at least 1&#8221; of water a week. Water is important for fruit growth.</li><li>They prefer 6-8 hours of sun.</li><li>Pruning is recommended in winter, for good air circulation and generally healthy plant growth.</li><li>When pruning, don&#8217;t let branches crisscross; this helps the plant get good air circulation.</li><li>The particular breed I bought (&#8220;Jersey northern highbush&#8221;) yields blueberries late in the year (as in, around now, instead of July through August.)</li><li>The particular variety I got is also self-pollinating, but also appreciates bees visiting from other blueberry plants.</li><li>Blueberries can propagate from cuttings! Not sure if I&#8217;ll try this out immediately, though.</li></ol><div>Something else I&#8217;ve learned, unspecific to blueberries, is that I should really research plant care before purchase. The blueberry plant I bought has a lot of crisscrossing branches already, and some branches that droop so low they touch the ground&#8230;I&#8217;m sure I could have picked a better one if I knew what to look for.</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
When Andou and I <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/07/a-guide-to-some-touristy-things-of-oahu.html">visited Hawaii last month</a>, we had arranged for SpeediShuttle to pick us up on the 7th of July. We waited until about an hour before our flight before we quit calling their unresponsive hotline for reasons why they hadn&#8217;t shown up yet, and called a taxi instead.<br /><br />Well, last weekend we finally heard back from them &#8211; more than seven weeks after we arranged from them to pick us up. It turns out that someone had taken in our information and mis-typed it, somehow taking our request for a July 7th pick-up and noting it as&nbsp;<i>Pick these people up on August 30th.</i><br /><i><br /></i>Though it was a stressful situation at the time, to be honest, after seven weeks it&#8217;s hard to grasp at even a semblance of bitterness. Mistakes happen. Even so, the SpeediShuttle people we spoke to were very kind and offered us a refund, which was great! :) That at least pays for (most of) the taxi fare, haha.<br /><br />To be honest, the thing I&#8217;m most curious about now is how the mistake was made. No matter how I look at the keypad, it seems far-fetched to mis-type <i>8/30</i>&nbsp;instead of <i>7/7</i>&#8230;was the person who made the appointment maybe using an HTML-style form with drop-downs&#8230;even on drop-downs, &#8220;30&#8221; is pretty far from &#8220;7&#8221;&#8230;I mean, if someone&#8217;s just inputting data into a computer, then maybe you could just have users fill in the data themselves, right? Rather than calling a human being to input pickup data for them, and then have no confirmation that the input data was correct?<br /><br />Furthermore, the fact that someone may miss their flight out when their system fails is a pretty serious consequence, one that may warrant at least one person manning their hotline at all times. Or if the hotline could at least take messages when no one&#8217;s there?<br /><br />Shrug.</div>

I like that it has a focus mainly on puzzles (all of which always seem unique and new), and besides that the scenes are just beautiful.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2E48fFhY70s/UEInRHTCiCI/AAAAAAAACVU/6tO3b8Yp4Do/s1600/awakening.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2E48fFhY70s/UEInRHTCiCI/AAAAAAAACVU/6tO3b8Yp4Do/s640/awakening.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">you can&#8217;t even see the particle effects floatin&#8217; around this thing, wuuuut</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Like, don&#8217;t you just want to <i>be here</i>?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VLaygD7IeAY/UEIndRF0ZqI/AAAAAAAACVk/pxOcm2Y_1uU/s1600/awakening2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VLaygD7IeAY/UEIndRF0ZqI/AAAAAAAACVk/pxOcm2Y_1uU/s640/awakening2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">c&#8217;mon! who could turn down a <i>flying waterfall tree</i>?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The voice acting is a little weird, but overall Awakening is a good source of dopamine yielded by doing A to get B which is needed for C to get D for E, etc.</div>

In her sleeping cabinet behind the rubble of an old barbershop where she lives with her grandfather, she thinks about what is lost-how the world went from amusement parks, movie theaters, birthday parties, fathers and mothers &#8230; to ash and dust, scars, permanent burns, and fused, damaged bodies. And now, at an age when everyone is required to turn themselves over to the militia to either be trained as a soldier or, if they are too damaged and weak, to be used as live targets, Pressia can no longer pretend to be small. Pressia is on the run.<br /><br />Burn a Pure and Breathe the Ash &#8230; <br />There are those who escaped the apocalypse unmarked. Pures. They are tucked safely inside the Dome that protects their healthy, superior bodies. Yet Partridge, whose father is one of the most influential men in the Dome, feels isolated and lonely. Different. He thinks about loss-maybe just because his family is broken; his father is emotionally distant; his brother killed himself; and his mother never made it inside their shelter. Or maybe it&#8217;s his claustrophobia: his feeling that this Dome has become a swaddling of intensely rigid order. So when a slipped phrase suggests his mother might still be alive, Partridge risks his life to leave the Dome to find her. <br /><br />When Pressia meets Partridge, their worlds shatter all over again.</i></blockquote><br />(spoilers ahead)<br /><br />I finished <i>Pure</i>&nbsp;yesterday and I feel fairly mixed about it. The world itself is immensely intriguing, comprised of a vast wasteland and a &#8220;Dome.&#8221; The wastelands are populated with people who, after the &#8220;Detonations,&#8221; found themselves fused to objects, animals, even other people around them. One of the main characters, Pressia, wanders a market filled with emaciated citizens whose flesh is part-glass; she flees the &#8220;Dusts,&#8221; stone-fleshed people who were pressed into buildings; there are even &#8220;Groupies,&#8221; people fused to other people, who seem notorious for drunken-ness and trouble-making.<br /><br />Though at some times I could see it being considered sparse, I adored the to-the-point description.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The droning was some kind of air mission, and we wondered if there would be more bombs. But what would be the point? Everything was done, obliterated or swept up by the fires; there were dark puddles from black rain. Some drank the water and died from it. Our scars were fresh, our wounds and warpings raw. The survivors hobbled and limped, a procession of death, hoping to find a place that had been spared. We gave up. We were slack. We didn&#8217;t take cover. Maybe some were hoping it was a relief effort. Maybe I was too.</i></blockquote><br />Description coming from the characters&#8217; mouths, however, felt heavy and extraneous at times.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;Did you ever wonder why we&#8217;re not experiencing a full nuclear winter? Well, because it was orchestrated to avoid one. They used a cocktail of bombs &#8211; the Low Orbiting Focused Enhanced Radiation Neutron System satellites known as LoFERNS, and the High Orbiting Focused Enhanced Radiation Neutron System satellites, or HiFERNS, with electromagnetic pulse &#8211; EMP &#8211; magnification.&#8221;<br /><br />[&#8230;]<br /><br />&#8220;And how did Dusts come about? The bombs disrupted molecular structures. The cocktails included the distribution of nanotechnology to help speed up the recovery of the earth &#8211; nanotechnology that promotes the self-assembly of molecules. The nanotechnology, speeded up by DNA, which is an informational material but also excellent at the self-assembly of cells, made our fusing stronger. And the nanotechnology that hit the humans trapped in rubble or scorced land helped them to regenerate. Even though they couldn&#8217;t completely free themselves, the human cells of the Dusts grew powerful and learned to survive.&#8221;</i></blockquote><br />I guess this all <i>might</i> be okay because the person speaking is characteristically pedantic? And is at the moment relaying &#8220;conspiracy theories&#8221; to a rebel audience? In the end, I suppose it&#8217;s my personal preference that details this specific about fake technology glossed over and left to stand real in their ambiguity.<br /><br />Characters also tend to realize things abruptly and completely believe in those realizations, or else remember something suddenly, pose it as a possible explanation for whatever is happening, and pages later accept it as fact.<br /><br />This book often references Japan due to the connection between &#8220;Detonations&#8221; and the effects of atomic bombs during World War II. I felt a little uncomfortable about Japan&#8217;s relation to the story, though, in ways that it&#8217;s difficult for me to describe. Pressia, who knows she&#8217;s half-Japanese (despite not knowing what &#8220;Japan&#8221; is), is described twice as having almond-shaped eyes, which feeds my personal pet peeve of non-white features described with food items (i.e. &#8220;caramel&#8221; or &#8220;chocolate&#8221; skin) &#8211; in some sense it serves as a reminder that everyone else in the book is European-descended (except, maybe, the character whose name is &#8220;El Capitan&#8221;).<br /><br />Later, another character theorizes,<br /><br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;Here&#8217;s my take. The man your mother had a child with, he was in one everything that the Japanese were doing &#8211; or trying to undo. Radiation resistance. Your mother fed him information. I agree with your mother&#8217;s decision there. <b>Some of the Japanese were really the good guys, if you ask me</b> [&#8230;]</i>&#8221;</blockquote><br />I don&#8217;t understand this part. If &#8220;some of the Japanese were really the good guys,&#8221; it kind of sounds like the majority of them are not? Or that it&#8217;s accepted knowledge that the majority of them were not? And what does &#8220;bad guys&#8221; mean in this scenario? I can&#8217;t imagine why anyone would think of radiation resistance scientists as &#8220;bad guys,&#8221; much less the civilian population affected by the bomb. By the end of the book, &#8220;Japan&#8221; ends up being nothing more than exotic wallpaper: almond-shaped eyes, shiny black hair, &#8220;even-toned skin&#8221; (what does this even mean and why is it ascribed to Pressia&#8217;s Japanese blood), a flashback of flowering branches, some random Japanese writing, and &#8220;some good guys.&#8221;<br /><br />One last thing that made me wince &#8211; this conversation, between a &#8220;Pure&#8221; person, Partridge, and Bradwell, who lived through the Detonations and was disfigured by them:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;Jesus!&#8221; [Bradwell] says, hit by a sudden flare of anger. &#8220;What&#8217;s it like to walk around perfect, huh, Partridge? No scars, no burns, no birds. To be a clean slate?&#8221;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>The question makes Partridge angry. &#8220;Just because I live in a Dome doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve never suffered. I mean, it&#8217;s not like your suffering. What could compare to this, huh? Do you want an award for it? A medal that says First Place Suffering? You win, Bradwell. Okay? You win.&#8221;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>[Partridge describes the death of his brother]</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Bradwell pauses a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about that.&#8221; It feels like an apology for a lot of things, actually, like thinking Partridge&#8217;s life was a cakewalk.</i></blockquote><br />This exchange was sigh-inducing to me because:<br /><br /><ol><li>Partridge is a character from a position of power that he <i>literally</i>&nbsp;has because his father orchestrated the bombing of all these people &#8211; who then demands from one of those people, &#8220;What about <i>my</i>&nbsp;problems?!&#8221;</li><li>Even if Partridge&#8217;s life was not 100% pure utter euphoria, his quality of life within the Dome (with edible food, education, general health) really just&nbsp;<i>can&#8217;t</i>&nbsp;be compared to Bradwell&#8217;s life, in which most days are described as a struggle, where everyone has been hurt by an elite few for the sake of the elite. </li><li>Even so, I guess it&#8217;s okay that characters from different backgrounds exchange sympathies? But in the end, Bradwell still feels like the bad guy &#8211; he sympathizes with Partridge, and Partridge doesn&#8217;t bother sympathizing with Bradwell at all.</li></ol><div>It&#8217;s just&#8230;sigh-inducing.</div><div><br /></div><div>There were a couple moments in the book where I was like, &#8220;Whoa, do you feel that? I just had the STRONGEST EMOTION,&#8221; so that was nice. I&#8217;m also curious to see how Fox 2000, who apparently has the film rights to this book, will depict a world in which the majority of people are visibly not &#8220;Pure.&#8221;</div></div>

For example, the following is wrong:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: html"><script src="game.js"></script> <!-- "WHERE IS #CANVAS" --><br /><canvas id="canvas"></canvas><br /></pre><br />In trying to do collision stuff, I also ran into a curious problem where the following did not work:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">if ( ((that.X-that.radius) &lt;= (player.X+player.width)) &amp;&amp;<br />(that.Y &gt;= player.Y) &amp;&amp;<br />(that.Y &lt; (player.y+player.height)))<br />collided = PADDLE;<br /></pre><br />But this <em>did</em>:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">var hit_paddle_side = beneath_paddle_top = above_paddle_bottom = false;<br /><br />if (((that.X-that.radius) &lt;= (player.X+player.width))) hit_paddle_side = true;                 if ((that.Y &gt;= player.Y)) beneath_paddle_top = true;<br />if ((that.Y &lt; (player.Y+player.height))) above_paddle_bottom = true;<br /><br />if (hit_paddle_side &amp;&amp; beneath_paddle_top &amp;&amp; above_paddle_bottom)<br />    collided = PADDLE;<br /></pre><br />Not sure why yet.<br /><br />All the code is <a href="https://github.com/neauro/html5pong">on my Github</a> for now.</div>
