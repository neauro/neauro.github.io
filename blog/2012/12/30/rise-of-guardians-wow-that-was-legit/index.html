By the end of the film, Jack&#8217;s character also undergoes a transformation to solve his problem:&nbsp;<i>My purpose is to share my love of &#8220;fun&#8221; with children, and now they believe in me. </i>In contrast, Ralph&#8217;s &#8220;transformation&#8221; seemed weak and frustrating to me personally; at the beginning he is a character who longs for recognition and acceptance, and at the end becomes happy because he gets&#8230;recognition and acceptance. It&#8217;s just a little boring. It&#8217;s like a story about someone who says, &#8220;You know what I would like? $5.&#8221; And then that someone meets a princess who gives him $5. The end!</li><li><b>The other primary characters interacted with Jack in ways that helped him with his transformation.</b>&nbsp;Santa teaches Jack the idea of a &#8220;center,&#8221; or something that Jack is <i>all about,</i>&nbsp;which Jack realizes he doesn&#8217;t know. Tooth teaches Jack that he was someone before he was Jack Frost, and later is an example of how the Guardians have become misaligned with their previous love of caring for children. Bunny is a sort of litmus test for Jack&#8217;s familiarity with the Guardians, and the Sandman&#8217;s death was what triggered Jack&#8217;s supercoldblizzard power (or whatever). The antagonist, Pitch, was also a foil for Jack, representing the &#8220;bad side&#8221; of wanting to be seen and recognized so badly that you would want children to fear you. In contrast, the interactions between Ralph and characters like Felix and <strike>Jane Lynch</strike> Sergeant Tamora were pretty shallow, and after the Hero&#8217;s Duty part of the movie, whenever you saw Tamora it was really just for romantic comedy fluff that had nothing to do with the movie&#8217;s title character.</li><li><b>The Tooth Fairy had her own not-man-related things going on, </b>including but not limited to control of whatever the fairy army is called and a love of gummy, bloody teeth that was amusingly ridiculous. Compare to the Sergeant, whose motivation is hate for the bug-things because they killed her husband (in her fake memories). It&#8217;s true that Tooth was fangirly about Jack&#8217;s teeth and all of her fairy minions were swooning over Jack&#8217;s hoarfrost bangs but I&#8217;ll take what I can get.</li><li><b>No romance! </b>(Beyond that too-long hug at the end between Tooth and Jack?)&nbsp;Just, thank you for not stuffing that into the movie, especially since it was already bursting its seams with all the fast-paced kingdom-touring and gold particle effects. (On a related note, #rainbowsnowcone and #frostbite seem to be what the shippers are calling Frost/Tooth.)</li></ul><br />There were a couple plot holes in the movie that bothered me somewhat (Why did they only need to round up teeth for one night to save Tooth? After everyone fell asleep in Jamie&#8217;s room, why were they suddenly in the sleigh, still-sleeping, later?) but I have been reading <i>Wired for Story</i>&nbsp;by Lisa Cron recently, and one of its tenets is that good stories are not about what just events that happen, but about the changes that happen in their characters. I&#8217;m not ready to forgive all plot holes for this reason, but it does give me a new lens into what details are the most important in story. In the case of these two movies, Jack&#8217;s change from the invisible, meaningless delinquent into someone that uses his fun for good is what made him so much more compelling to me, and enjoyable to watch as well.</div>
