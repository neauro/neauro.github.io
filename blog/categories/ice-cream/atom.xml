<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y46KRPk3WCc/ULg63-aWw9I/AAAAAAAAC1I/uxF40k4xeL4/s1600/DSC_0086.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y46KRPk3WCc/ULg63-aWw9I/AAAAAAAAC1I/uxF40k4xeL4/s640/DSC_0086.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sor-bay? sher-bet?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I made my first "real" sorbet today! ("Real" being my way of distinguishing this sorbet from my actual first sorbet-making experience, in which I fastidiously measured out a cup of pineapple juice into a sorbet mixture, and then poured into the ice cream maker not this mixture, but the leftover pineapple juice. Whoops.)<br /><br />I really adore ice cream and gave an ice cream maker to my mother last Christmas, which she gave back to me after admitting she'd probably never use it. Molly Moon's book -- with its color, environmentally friendly morals, and cheering that you can really do it, it's easy! -- is what really got me interested in trying to make ice cream. But, since it was on hold at the library, I found a different book to use for initial experiments.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OyXLb-jT3RU/ULg8XgnBOOI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/P9IThybKY2E/s1600/recipe-week-ice-cream-52-easy-recipes-for-sally-sampson-paperback-cover-art.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OyXLb-jT3RU/ULg8XgnBOOI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/P9IThybKY2E/s1600/recipe-week-ice-cream-52-easy-recipes-for-sally-sampson-paperback-cover-art.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this one! (<a href="http://www.tower.com/recipe-week-ice-cream-52-easy-recipes-for-sally-sampson-paperback/wapi/111692076">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470169451/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470169451&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Recipe of the Week: Ice Cream: 52 Easy Recipes for Year-Round Frozen Treats</a>&nbsp;</i>is just as simple as Molly Moon's book, and it emphasizes using more fresh ingredients to enhance ice cream flavor. This is my source for the sorbet above, which is really just coconut milk, pineapple juice, and orange juice, with a little bit of cinnamon on top because it seemed like it needed something for the photo.<br /><br />I didn't realize making ice cream was so easy. The ice cream maker, a contraption I always regarded as impermeably mysterious for some reason, is in fact just a sort of canister with frozen stuff in it, in which you're supposed to whip up your mixture such that it freezes along the sides and gets filled with air in the process. Most ice cream recipes seem like some variation of "Put cream and other things into a saucepan, bring it to a simmer, let it cool, then throw it in an ice cream maker."<br /><br />Here's to a cool future.</div>
