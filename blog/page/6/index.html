I can&#8217;t believe how much I&#8217;ve learned over the past four months, including but not limited to standard stuff like jQuery that I have always wanted to practice but hadn&#8217;t found the time for.<br /><br />This particular layout makes use of a new CSS trick that I learned, and really like &#8211; a way to resize the &#8220;top&#8221; div of a website so that it always fits in the space above the fold, no matter the size. All you need is a container div, and inside that two more divs: one for the area above the fold (the &#8220;landing&#8221;), and one for your &#8220;main&#8221; information.<br /><br />The CSS looks like:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:js">html,body {<br />margin:0px auto;<br />height:100%;<br />}<br /><br />div#container {<br />min-width:100%;<br />height:100%;<br />}<br /><br />div#landing {<br />width:100%;<br />height:100%;<br />background: #5d5d5d url("../images/header_bg.jpg") center center no-repeat;<br />background-size:cover;<br />}<br /><br />div#main {<br />background-color:#eeeee2;<br />}<br /></pre><br />And the HTML should be like:<br /><pre class="brush:xml">&lt;body&gt;<br /><div id="container">&nbsp;<br /><div id="landing">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top part of page<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;<br /><div id="main">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rest of the page<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div>&lt;/body&gt;<br /></pre><br />How exciting.</div>

The Sisterhood always knows best. The Guardians will protect and serve. The Unconsecrated will never relent. And you must always mind the fence that surrounds the village; the fence that protects the village from the Forest of Hands and Teeth. But, slowly, Mary’s truths are failing her. She’s learning things she never wanted to know about the Sisterhood and its secrets, and the Guardians and their power, and about the Unconsecrated and their relentlessness. When the fence is breached and her world is thrown into chaos, she must choose between her village and her future—between the one she loves and the one who loves her. And she must face the truth about the Forest of Hands and Teeth. Could there be life outside a world surrounded in so much death?</em></blockquote><br />I just finished reading The Forest of Hands and Teeth, which was okay. The premise was intriguing and I was looking forward to an engagement with The Whole Zombie Thing that didn&#8217;t have guns blazing. Overall the book&#8217;s mood is super introspective, with the protagonist Mary aching for the ocean, the concept of which has been handed down to her from her mother. Eventually, Mary sees the ocean in a photo and can describe it as having &#8220;whitecaps&#8221; despite possibly never seeing anything with whitecaps before?<br /><br />I wasn&#8217;t really invested in any of the characters. There are four &#8220;main&#8221; ones, all of whom are childhood friends: Mary, Cass, and Travis and Harry, who are brothers. Mary and Travis have a mutual love, and Harry loves Mary for some reason and gets betrothed to her, and Cass loves Harry for a reason but is betrothed to Travis, and stays betrothed to Travis even when she falls in love with Harry.<br /><br />&#8220;But we can make this work,&#8221; Mary says when she realizes this, at which point Cass hisses something like, &#8220;No! Harry chose you and I want Harry to be happy so I will go with his will! And Travis won&#8217;t make Harry sad either by taking you away from him, so there!&#8221;<br /><br />(Why do they all care about what Harry wants so much? I&#8217;m not sure.) <br /><br />The heights of emotional dialogue in the book involve characters getting flustered about whether or not Mary cares about them, and whether or not they are her #1 motivation (which, spoilers, is The Ocean).<br /><br />The book moves fast and feels cramped at times. In two pages Mary and Travis have their first mind-blowing kiss AND marvel in horror at the Fast Zombie Who Wears a Noticeably Red Vest (who I can only ever visualize as a cross between <a href="http://left4dead.wikia.com/wiki/The_Witch">a Witch</a> and <a href="http://gointothestory.blcklst.com/2012/03/great-character-the-little-girl-in-red-schindlers-list.html">that girl from <em>Schindler&#8217;s List</em></a>).<br /><br />Overall I wish there was more time to get settled into what daily life was like for these characters, surrounded by the undead. Mary spends a lot of time thinking about how awful it is to be surrounded by death but I would have liked to be struck with details about it &#8211; the way as children they might have played chicken out of the reach of desperate, broken fingers &#8211; more about their childhood, actually, would have made them bright and real, more than just a description like &#8220;we have always been friends.&#8221; I would have wanted to see what Harry excelled at if not shooting arrows, why Travis was lured by Mary&#8217;s stories to also long for Ocean-ness, how Cass&#8217;s &#8220;sunshine&#8221; was anything more than her bright hair or a weird smell her flesh gave off.<br /><br />Something else about this book that gave me a niggling feeling was how much time Mary spent bemoaning how bad her life was surrounded by &#8220;so much death.&#8221; The pre-zombie days seem far back away from her time &#8211; so far enough back that I don&#8217;t quite buy how much she wants them. How can she miss something she never really had? Despite being told a lot about The Good Old Days through various mediums, I personally can&#8217;t find myself really aching for them, despite the intimidating problems we have now, like horrendous pollution, wealth disparity, Facebook-derived social anxiety, and so on.<br /><br />I still have enough interest in the idea of how hope can perservere in such a world that I&#8217;m tempted to pick up the next book.</div>

(&#8220;Real&#8221; being my way of distinguishing this sorbet from my actual first sorbet-making experience, in which I fastidiously measured out a cup of pineapple juice into a sorbet mixture, and then poured into the ice cream maker not this mixture, but the leftover pineapple juice. Whoops.)<br /><br />I really adore ice cream and gave an ice cream maker to my mother last Christmas, which she gave back to me after admitting she&#8217;d probably never use it. Molly Moon&#8217;s book &#8211; with its color, environmentally friendly morals, and cheering that you can really do it, it&#8217;s easy! &#8211; is what really got me interested in trying to make ice cream. But, since it was on hold at the library, I found a different book to use for initial experiments.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OyXLb-jT3RU/ULg8XgnBOOI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/P9IThybKY2E/s1600/recipe-week-ice-cream-52-easy-recipes-for-sally-sampson-paperback-cover-art.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OyXLb-jT3RU/ULg8XgnBOOI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/P9IThybKY2E/s1600/recipe-week-ice-cream-52-easy-recipes-for-sally-sampson-paperback-cover-art.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this one!

This is my source for the sorbet above, which is really just coconut milk, pineapple juice, and orange juice, with a little bit of cinnamon on top because it seemed like it needed something for the photo.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t realize making ice cream was so easy. The ice cream maker, a contraption I always regarded as impermeably mysterious for some reason, is in fact just a sort of canister with frozen stuff in it, in which you&#8217;re supposed to whip up your mixture such that it freezes along the sides and gets filled with air in the process. Most ice cream recipes seem like some variation of &#8220;Put cream and other things into a saucepan, bring it to a simmer, let it cool, then throw it in an ice cream maker.&#8221;<br /><br />Here&#8217;s to a cool future.</div>

The popularity&nbsp;of <em>Skyfall</em> didn&#8217;t mean that <em>Wreck-It&nbsp;</em><em>Ralph</em> had open seats, however, so Andou and I&nbsp;opted to see the still-open 3D movie.<br /><br />[spoilers]<br /><br />It was super beautiful, and all the video game&nbsp;references at the beginning were pretty delightful,&nbsp;yet not, in my opinion, cheesy and overwhelming. It&nbsp;was fun to hear people practically scream at the&nbsp;Metal Gear Solid reference, though my personal&nbsp;favorite was a shot of Sonic blinking and losing his&nbsp;rings after being hit by that spaceship thing :D<br /><br />Overall I was really impressed by the clarity of the&nbsp;story, especially given the risk of confusion&nbsp;resulting from relying on too much video game&nbsp;esoterica or fanservice. Certain words and certain&nbsp;settings threw their weight into the plot&#8217;s goings-on, and it was nice to feel that the things&nbsp;you saw were, for the most part, not just shiny&nbsp;fluff, but would actually deliver on some interesting and relevant happening.<br /><br />One thing that I just couldn&#8217;t stand was the&nbsp;character Vanellope.&nbsp;I couldn&#8217;t muster up sympathy for her at all. @__@  I&nbsp;guess the idea is that her immaturity, selfishness,&nbsp;and spontaneity are okay because she&#8217;s a child and&nbsp;she has enormous caramel apple-colored eyes? As a&nbsp;character who seems solely there to be &#8220;adorable&#8221; and&nbsp;act as a motivation for the protagonist, I felt&nbsp;mixed&#8230;and had a lot of weird feelings about the&nbsp;character interactions in general.<br /><br />On one hand, it&#8217;s nice that Ralph finally finds&nbsp;&#8220;goodness&#8221; not in the accumulation of shiny extrinsic things&nbsp;(like that &#8220;Hero&#8221; medal), but rather in helping&nbsp;others (specifically, Vanellope). On the other hand,&nbsp;the whole &#8220;I&#8217;m Ralph and just seeing Vanellope be&nbsp;happy is what I need to be happy :&#8217;)&#8221; had a heteronormative tinge &#8211; <em>Helping children be&nbsp;</em><em>happy is the most important thing in the world!&nbsp;</em>&#8211; and ultimately I feel like I wish Ralph had come&nbsp;to learn more about what he does personally that make&nbsp;him uniquely happy, rather than having his newfound&nbsp;happiness hinge so much on helping a specific person realize their aspirations. I mean, the movie is called <em>Wreck-It <strong>Ralph</strong></em>, right?<br /><br />The inevitable marriage between the only other female main character and the only other male main character was also hugely wince-inducing, just because it seemed so&#8230;forced&#8230;and inevitable. (Ack! I wince just thinking about it!)<br /><br />Anyway, Vanellope seems unexpectedly popular on Tumblr, so I&#8217;m still musing on the reasons why I don&#8217;t like her. Maybe I missed something&#8230;</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So I found a gifset of Sword Art Online on Tumblr and decided that I wanted to watch it, because the art is pretty and also because the characters looked familiar, probably because Sword Art Online is one of the light novels I bought (and subsequently lost) some time ago.  <br /><br />Well, no matter!<br /><br />Sword Art Online (SAO) details the adventures of Kirito, who is one of ten thousand players trapped in the newly-released &#8220;virtual reality&#8221; MMORPG of the same name. The creator of SAO, who turns out to be some kind of eccentric psychopath, removes the &#8220;Log Out&#8221; button on the first day of open play and announces that everyone will have to reach and defeat Floor 100 in order to return back to the Real World. In the meantime, if you die in the game, you die in real life.<br /><br />I was excited because Kirito has bangs (my favorite ridiculous anime hair affectation) and spends the opening looking Dark and Tormented (my favorite ridiculous anime stereotype). Additionally, the &#8220;main&#8221; female character, Asuna, appears in the opening running around and doing things.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SVwGKD2OF2Y/UKRq787wvXI/AAAAAAAACyY/FAquBkYgszk/s1600/sao.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="387" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SVwGKD2OF2Y/UKRq787wvXI/AAAAAAAACyY/FAquBkYgszk/s640/sao.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">go, asuna, go! clear that low bar of agency!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />[spoilers ahead]<br /><br />Inevitably this first season was full of the same old tired female character stereotypes/storylines/actions, including but not limited to:<br /><br /><ul><li>female characters that basically act as pretty receptacles and mirrors for Kirito&#8217;s feelings, for example:</li><ul><li>Silica, Dragon Tamer Girl: who appeared for one episode to be Kirito&#8217;s &#8220;little sister,&#8221; with bonus panicked upskirts</li><li>Lisbeth, Smith Girl: who appeared for one episode to be a love interest that is irrelevant after the one episode</li></ul><li>male characters not caring that female characters don&#8217;t like them or want to be near them, for example:</li><ul><li>That one guy refuses to stop being Asuna&#8217;s escort, and says he&#8217;ll only leave her alone if Kirito wins against him a duel (what)</li><li>The leader of Asuna&#8217;s guild, who, when Asuna tells him she wants to leave the guild, says she can only leave if Kirito wins against him in a duel (what)</li></ul><li>There&#8217;s also a sub-plot that involves a woman who is murdered by her husband because, in the life-threatening situation of Sword Art Online, she stopped being &#8220;cute and obedient&#8221; and became instead a &#8220;lively and active&#8221; guild leader&#8230;<em>what?</em> It&#8217;s obvious that this particular guy character is horrible, but I guess I&#8217;m bewildered by this story, which seemed to come out of nowhere, and didn&#8217;t really serve to teach any characters about anything. Maybe if at the end Kirito had thought something like, <i>Wow, this really makes me appreciate Asuna&#8217;s fighting skill more</i>&#8230;?</li></ul><br />The things that I <em>did</em> enjoy about this anime were the little game-related details, which take on a &#8220;private joke&#8221; feeling that I think was delightful and <em>not</em> uncomfortably blatant with fanfare and winking (&#8220;Hey! That was a game reference! Get it? Eh? <em>Ehhhh</em>?&#8221;). Characters gossip about other characters who have legendary status because their &#8220;HP bar has never fallen to yellow.&#8221; At some point Kirito hits a wall in anger and the wall flashes with a notification &#8211; <code>IMMORTAL OBJECT</code> &#8211; indicating that it&#8217;s inanimate and&nbsp;indestructible&nbsp; Best part: this little moment turns out to have plot significance later. Whoa! I <em>really</em> appreciate the meaningful subtlety.<br /><br />It&#8217;s also fun to view what happens to characters as they become trapped in the digital world, though I wish it were explored more, perhaps in lieu of unnecessary female character fanservice. Some people commit suicide; some dedicate themselves to fighting on &#8220;the front lines&#8221; to free everyone; some people become merchants and smiths to support the fighters. One old man, thinking that he&#8217;d never get his real-life job back anyway, decides that he&#8217;ll perfect in-game fishing.<br /><br />Inevitably Kirito and Asuna fall into a relationship, an unexpectedly intense and serious romance that involves them getting married (in-game) and living together in a cabin in the woods (on the game&#8217;s Floor 22) and eventually meeting a girl that they &#8220;adopt&#8221; as their daughter (who later turns out to be a game process AI). Something that&#8217;s refreshing about their relationship is the trust they have in each other &#8211; Kirito&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;hangs behind while Asuna fights, and at one point just smiles when someone tries to warn him to get his wife out of the way of a giant attacking fish. Though they were rarer than the opposite, I appreciated the parts where Kirito gave Asuna a place to stand on her own and defend and be appreciated for her actions and thoughts and talents, which weren&#8217;t all Kirito-centered (for example, her&nbsp;experimentation&nbsp;with cooking and seeing which mixture of in-game loots and essences could make real-world flavors like soy sauce).<br /><br />Given the intensity of their dedication to each other (Kirito declares to Asuna that his entire self belongs to her; Asuna says that if Kirito dies, she&#8217;ll commit suicide), it&#8217;s uncomfortable and bewildering why the second season of SAO, which is still on-going, keeps pushing this love triangle forward between Kirito and his sister-who-is-actually-his-cousin. I mean, this isn&#8217;t going to pan out, right? Is this just an excuse to keep having unrequited romantic (slash incestuous and forbidden) tension in the show to keep people watching? Is devoted love so boring? After all that the two characters have been through together, and after the show gives you so much reason to invest in the semi-doomed lovebank of Kirito/Asuna, it&#8217;s hard to see this extra, new girl as anything but annoying fan service. <br /><br />Something else a little depressing is the impending descent of Asuna into a caged bird that doesn&#8217;t do much but stare forlornly into space whenever her captor, a despised fiancé in a real-world arranged marriage who is keeping her unconscious and trapped in a new MMORPG, comes to threaten her warmly with sexual assault or erasure of her memories. In the most recent episode, Asuna sneakily watched him unlock the door to her cage, which made me assume hopefully that she would try to escape on her own. Unfortunately, she just collapsed on her knees and cried, &#8220;Save me, Kirito!&#8221;<br /><br />It&#8217;s not that I blame her for her circumstances or think that she could fight her way out of it if she wanted&#8230;I just don&#8217;t want her to become a full-on damsel in distress. :(<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LxyJxHtHaZ4/UKRswdDNWJI/AAAAAAAACyg/8JOOm1RLdCk/s1600/sao2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="366" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LxyJxHtHaZ4/UKRswdDNWJI/AAAAAAAACyg/8JOOm1RLdCk/s640/sao2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">low bar of agency: not cleared (<a href="http://kimmygawa.tumblr.com/post/34445253622/weird-guy-that-smell-asunas-hair-made-her-cry">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Having met the end of the anime that&#8217;s presently out, I&#8217;ve been devouring the light novels, where fanservice-y upskirts are not as prominent and where Asuna is more of an active character during the &#8220;fairy&#8221; arc, escaping and fighting and doing what she can. As a series the whole thing is&nbsp;<i>really </i>fun to watch &#8211; it&#8217;s&nbsp;beautiful, and really stretches, embroiders, and <i>uses</i> its theme of video game worlds and realities.</div>

Asuna Yuuki is a heroine and the partner of Kirito in the Sword Art Online series. Her original avatar in <a href="http://www.cosplayfield.com/sword-art-online-alo-c-545_550.html" rel="nofollow">ALfheim Online</a>, was as Fairy Queen, Titania. She wore a white outfit, with a white long skirt, tube top showing her belly, along with a red ribbon that goes around the top part of her top that comes together to make a bow. She goes barefoot, and wears a white strip around her ankles! This <a href="http://www.cosplayfield.com/sao-alfheim-online-asuna-yuuki-cosplay-costume-p-523.html" rel="nofollow">Asuna Yuuki cosplay costume</a> looks like a long dress, and this is why I love it very much!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Ever since my old roommate Molly made butternut squash a couple years ago, I&#8217;ve really wanted to try making it myself. My first experience with it was like <i>whoa</i>. Who knew such decadence could some from such an unassuming squash?<br /><br />I found <a href="http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/detail.asp?docid=31244">a recipe from the online version of Cook&#8217;s Illustrated</a>&nbsp;to try out, since other recipes I found toss in tons of cream and recommend roasting the squash to dehydrate it and bring out its flavor, and I didn&#8217;t want to go through the extra effort and ingredients.&nbsp;What no one mentions, however, is that the most time-consuming part of cooking butternut squash soup is actually processing the squash in the first place. I tried three different knives to peel and cube this thing, each less sufficient than the last.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q435kdunnFQ/UI2gz-YbrdI/AAAAAAAACu8/EBkYIteOgnQ/s1600/butternut1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="380" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q435kdunnFQ/UI2gz-YbrdI/AAAAAAAACu8/EBkYIteOgnQ/s640/butternut1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">@_____@</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The next obstacle was my lack of a Dutch oven, which is what the recipe suggests you cook everything in. An internet search seemed to suggest that any old pot with some foil put over the top of it would suffice, so I tried that, but then came across Problem #2: my pot was way too small to fit all the squash and leeks, much less another four cups of vegetable broth. So, I decided to cook two halves of the soon-to-be-soup separately, except probably this pot was really not the best pot to use in the first place, because it became severely burnt.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fhks8KwDpiw/UI2g1EliJVI/AAAAAAAACvM/XUevdLW3rIU/s1600/butternut3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fhks8KwDpiw/UI2g1EliJVI/AAAAAAAACvM/XUevdLW3rIU/s640/butternut3.jpg" width="562" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i really doubt this is the &#8220;fond&#8221; that&#8217;s supposed to form at the pot&#8217;s bottom</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I moved to a shallower pan and that seemed to work.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eqJHjzzHAvA/UI2g1prxHEI/AAAAAAAACvU/Tr74gpu-aKU/s1600/butternut4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eqJHjzzHAvA/UI2g1prxHEI/AAAAAAAACvU/Tr74gpu-aKU/s640/butternut4.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">&#8230;maybe?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />By the time all of the squash had been boiled down, it still wasn&#8217;t quite&#8230;soupy.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5MAPtVEXTYQ/UI2g2U-TAHI/AAAAAAAACvc/b5e8R9SW08Q/s1600/butternut5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5MAPtVEXTYQ/UI2g2U-TAHI/AAAAAAAACvc/b5e8R9SW08Q/s640/butternut5.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">:C</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I thought I would be okay without a blender, but the soup at this stage was very fibrous and chunky and unappealing. Enter Problem #3: I have no food processor!<br /><br />Luckily the neighbors do, so we ran over there just to make use of their Vitamix.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QVtCSxR0fMc/UI2g2-VznJI/AAAAAAAACvk/l749c7wmNw4/s1600/butternut6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QVtCSxR0fMc/UI2g2-VznJI/AAAAAAAACvk/l749c7wmNw4/s640/butternut6.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">YES. IT LOOKS LIKE SOUP. YESSS</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Final touch: a swirl of sour cream, which sounded questionable but actually complemented the flavors very well.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jpH3ScABd-4/UI2g3UUSZ1I/AAAAAAAACvs/WihZfU0D9SY/s1600/butternut7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jpH3ScABd-4/UI2g3UUSZ1I/AAAAAAAACvs/WihZfU0D9SY/s640/butternut7.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">woo!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It was delicious! Hopefully I&#8217;ll have the chance to make this recipe again before the season&#8217;s out.</div>

Their personalities clash and contrast in a way that&#8217;s fun to read, and their personalities also reflect the basic &#8220;archetypes&#8221; of this future world: people who are excited to buy in (Cecily), people who want to fight the supposed inevitable (Rhine), and people who just want &#8220;a luxurious place to die&#8221; (Jenna). Each character has their their own talents and even&nbsp;<i>use</i>&nbsp;them for things relevant to character emotion/development, for example Cecily knocking out furious symphonies on the piano when Jenna dies.<br /><br />In contrast, none of the male characters are that interesting. Linden, the grieving and oblivious head of house, is predictable and boring in his fumbling and innocent adoration of Rhine. The dark secrets of his wives (that they were abducted for his pleasure, that Jenna&#8217;s sisters were murdered when Jenna was taken) are kept from him, and I wish that he <i>had</i>&nbsp;learned of them, just to stir things up.&nbsp;Gabriel, a servant who is Rhine&#8217;s secret (and inevitable) love interest, is kinda cute in his sneaking candy to Rhine beneath breakfast pancakes, but isn&#8217;t anything more than a blue-eyed guy who is described to like ships. Ordinarily I would appreciate that Gabriel liked <i>something</i>, but unlike the girls having a talent and executing on it, Gabriel does little to prove he likes boats other than talk about it sometimes. I guess I would better appreciate ships being really integral to him &#8211; not just something in the side &#8211; I wish he looked out hazy-eyed as if to an ocean, I wish when he made pancakes for Rhine he shaped them not like towers but like ships. When he told Rhine she was named after a river I wish he hadn&#8217;t learned randomly, but that he had seen it because he was looking at rivers, imagining how he would sail them.<br /><br />I won&#8217;t go into too much detail of the flawed plot and world-building since other reviews do that quite well already, in particular <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/117137212">this one</a>, which points out that hurricanes can&#8217;t happen in a world where there are no more continents except North America. It also notes that if the polar ice caps had really melted in Rhine&#8217;s world, then very little of Florida, the book&#8217;s main setting, would be above water. I personally don&#8217;t mind if books are not scientifically plausible &#8211; it&#8217;s fiction! &#8211; but it did grate on me when Rhine, the main character, started learning about Christopher Columbus.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>I educate myself on the polar ice caps, vaporized long ago by warfare, and an explorer named Christopher Columbus who proved the earth was round.</i></blockquote><br />I guess it just figures that the world would be completely destroyed but the myth of Columbus would still somehow be perpetuated above anything else that&#8217;s ever happened in thousands of years of human history. Also uncomfortable is the ethnocentrism of North America being the only continent &#8220;technologically advanced&#8221; enough to escape world war as anything other than a tiny landmass invisible from space. I mean, you know other countries have technology too, right? People from other countries even <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/year/">win Nobel Prizes</a>!<br /><br />It also figures that memories of Asian countries of the future would be condensed into exotic caricatures, that Japan is nothing more than cherry blossoms and geishas, and India is nothing more than saris and bindis that the characters emulate by pressing stickers on their foreheads. This <i>isn&#8217;t</i>&nbsp;cultural appreciation; it&#8217;s an erasure of the fact that Japanese and Indian people are more than just neat costumes you wish you had.</div>

It contains fava beans, olive oil, tomatoes, green onions, feta, boiled egg, and other things I can&#8217;t remember. You eat it with crisp, freshly-made baguette bread, and it&#8217;s one of the most startlingly wonderful and fresh tastes I&#8217;ve ever discovered.</div>

I finally had the chance to make cupcakes the other day for the Halloween Sakura-Con staff party!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jqQNPOsnygY/UInWQfOAxUI/AAAAAAAACsI/PLLIU0ZglHg/s1600/peanutcupcake1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jqQNPOsnygY/UInWQfOAxUI/AAAAAAAACsI/PLLIU0ZglHg/s640/peanutcupcake1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">yum</td></tr></tbody></table><br />These are peanut butter and jelly cupcakes from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307460444/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307460444&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Martha Stewart cupcake book</a>, which I appreciate for its large, inspiring photos and general ability to strike me with cupcake inspiration every once in a while. Unlike other cupcake books, it contains a variety of <i>recipes</i>, and not just different ways to arrange colored frost for the holidays.<br /><br />For these cupcakes, I lacked jelly, so instead used some &#8220;huckleberry creamed&#8221; honey retrieved from a market near Ellensberg.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jb0geUWmtA0/UInWP_D_03I/AAAAAAAACsE/bmX3awvr5k8/s1600/peanutcupcake.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="498" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jb0geUWmtA0/UInWP_D_03I/AAAAAAAACsE/bmX3awvr5k8/s640/peanutcupcake.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i think they still tasted fine</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I&#8217;m not actually a fan of peanut butter sweets, so next time I&#8217;ll probably go for the tried-and-true (and favorite) Oreo cheesecake cupcakes, or the blackberry cornmeal ones.</div>
