I haven&#8217;t done <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> before because it&#8217;s an event that seems to me to stress quantity over quality, and if there&#8217;s something that I know I&#8217;ve been doing since I was in junior high, it&#8217;s writing a lot.  I have hundreds of pages of 8.5pt Verdana Word Documents, for a story that I would still consider myself in the process of writing, though it&#8217;s undergone pretty drastic changes since back then (most of them for the good).  My old .doc files that contain culled stuff (just in case) is longer than the actual story itself.  I mean, I started writing a <em>sequel</em> to this story before it was even finished.  (O you eighth grade self!)<br /><br />So, I don&#8217;t usually feel accomplished if I reach a certain count of words.<br /><br />That being said, I don&#8217;t usually feel accomplished either if I don&#8217;t write anything at all, so in between work, school, and bouts of Magic I&#8217;ve been chipping away at my own NaNo.  I&#8217;ve fallen a bit behind but am certain I can catch up over Thanksgiving break.<br /><br />&#8230;but only if I can&#8217;t get a copy of Skyward Sword. o___o<br /><br />The story itself is set in Anthem, the of my semi-inactive <a href="http://opalitewires.blogspot.com/">Opalite Wires</a> writing practice blog thing.<br /><br />Here are the first two paragraphs:<br /><br /><blockquote>In Quartzal, the gravity was a little lighter than usual.  This is why it was the main Lower Anthem district for the passerine, who find their flight more easily won in the skies there; a few powerful rows and you’re off, unlike in lower districts where some passerine struggle or else don’t visit at all.  A favorite tagline for passerine tourist was that in Quartzal, one’s wings often open by themselves, which indeed seems to be the case, especially in narrow restaurants where this sort of abrupt twitch can be taken very poorly.  The most popular restaurant in Quartzal served soup comprising a variety of things harvested from the explored regions of Anthem (fungus from Slatemet, cuttles from Obsidash, lightning from Tonsor) in tiny pots balanced on the backs of salamanders, who especially didn’t take kindly to abrupt movements.  Singed tongues, brows, and too much ruined furniture led the proprietors of that particular store to adopt a bound-wing policy, in which winged guests such as the passerine would be required to don a semi-attractive set of belts that had been repurposed to hold wings shut in the unfortunate but inevitable event that Quartzal’s mysterious lightness would force them open.<br /><br />It was one of the few places where rain was welcomed; for with the biannual season of downpours came a great amount of mud, which transformed choking crystalline dust into fine pearly mud that passersby were loathe to scrub from their vehicles, whether they were carriages or cycles or the long, equinal dragons that were the present fashionable mount of Quartzal’s earth-bound bipedal beings.  Rain that fell from beyond the perimeters of the district Quartzal was the only kind of liquid which would render the dirt of Quartzal in this way; water that had been stored in cisterns for the dry season would fail to bring about the same effect, as would water hauled from the lower oceans, as far below as Coralanem, where indeed someone had tried to harvest the water that loved its depth so much it would struggle against the vases of abductors with churning and hisses.  It had to be rain - rain fallen fresh and cool from the skies, water that had rested in the clouds for so long that it had forgotten everything but dozing in the breeze, sometimes calm, sometimes with fits.</blockquote></div>

Yeah!  I actually really wanted to make &quot;Her Will&quot; into a Flash platformer (http://neauro.com/content/writing/herwill/writing.pdf) but couldn&#39;t quite think of a good mechanic to build around.  You should let me know if you come up with any ideas!  I&#39;d be up for doing fun storygame stuff outside of normal work.</div>

Werewolf deck is getting more complete than it was <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/10/silly-werewolf-decklist.html">before</a>, thanks to trades and gifts from Chris and Edison-san!<br /><br />Here&#8217;s the newer version:<br /><br /><br /><strong>Creatures</strong><br />4x Reckless Waif<br />4x Kruin Outlaw<br />3x Instigator Gang<br />2x Daybreak Ranger<br />4x Mayor of Avabruck<br />2x Gatstaf Shepherd<br /><br /><strong>Spells/Artifacts</strong><br />2x Ranger&#8217;s Guile<br />4x Full Moon&#8217;s Rise<br />4x Moonmist<br />3x Incinerate<br />3x Shock<br /><br /><strong>Lands</strong><br />4x Rootbound Crag<br />2x Kessig Wolf Run<br />1x Copperline Gorge<br />10x Mountain<br />8x Forest<br /><br /><br />Also, reasons why:<br /><ul><li>No more red two drops in the form of Village Ironsmith, but given the choice of having Village Ironsmith or Kruin Outlaw, I&#8217;d always want Kruin, even if it took another turn to get out.</li><li>I initially had some Prey Upons as kill cards, but the problem with them is that they are Sorceries, which means I need to play them on my turn if I ever want to use them &#8211; my precious turn, which I could have instead used to play nothing, in order to transform wolves.  Awoooo~</li><li>Incinerates/Shocks are Instants and can be played on the opponent&#8217;s turn, which means I can skip my own turn to go wolves, then still kill things.  Hurray!  (To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure why I didn&#8217;t have many of these earlier.)</li><li>Less Instigator Gang: because Andou explained to me that when you get 4 of something, that means that you usually want a high chance of getting that card on your opening hand, and Instigator Gang (with a cost of 4 mana) is really more of a later-game thing.</li><li>Max Mayor of Avabruck: because he&#8217;s a two drop which can buff either humans or werewolves, and also potentially generate 3/3 Wolf tokens in the end step, which can block hits on the opponent&#8217;s next turn if I happen to go all in with werewolves at the end of my turn.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FrivM_1Q3zk/TrijFXjAuKI/AAAAAAAAAhM/TZTkhlZJeQU/s1600/827_mayorofavabruck_alt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="251" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FrivM_1Q3zk/TrijFXjAuKI/AAAAAAAAAhM/TZTkhlZJeQU/s320/827_mayorofavabruck_alt.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">and how can you say no to this mustache?<br />(<a href="http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/donath.html">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li>No more Manabarbs: because I really wanted them to be successful, but I was never able to pull them off.  I guess the problem is that with werewolves you really have to watch your spell usage in general, and if it&#8217;s my turn I&#8217;d rather be playing Full Moon&#8217;s Rise, or another werewolf.</li><li>No more Caravan vigil or Traveler&#8217;s Amulet or Shimmering Grotto: because those were really just there as substitutes for Rootbound Crags or Copperline Gorges, which I now have 4 and 1 of, respectively.  Both can tap for red or green, but Rootbound Crag will come into play tapped if you do not already control a Forest or Mountain, and Copperline Gorge will come into play tapped if you already have more than two lands in general.  It is a little weird to have just one Copperline Gorge; on one hand I&#8217;d benefit by having a lot of them because then I&#8217;d be sure to get them in an opening hand (meaning they would be able to come into play untapped), on the other hand I&#8217;d have a lot of them, and even if I got them in my first hand, that would mean that one of them would definitely come into play tapped.</li></ul><br />Thus far werewolf deck is faring pretty well against Andou&#8217;s white token deck and is kinda-sorta even with his white/green humans.  I&#8217;m not sure how to improve upon it anymore, except to keep balancing mana; I recently took out a Shock and an Incinerate and replaced them with more land, but then felt like I was getting gluts of useless land every turn when really a burning spell would have been nice.  So it goes.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Two weekends ago, I did what I said I would never do.<br /><br />I bought a box of Magic: The Gathering cards.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Am5D7PU8S4M/TqNJRm0wFcI/AAAAAAAAAe4/z5RkvDWsx0c/s1600/IMG_0086%255B1%255D.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Am5D7PU8S4M/TqNJRm0wFcI/AAAAAAAAAe4/z5RkvDWsx0c/s320/IMG_0086%255B1%255D.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">faux depth-of-field courtesy of<a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Back in the day I was unreasonably obsessed with the Pokemon TCG.  To this day I remember a couple of my more memorable trades in Latchkey &#8211; a Dewgong and a Machoke for a Clefairy, a Zapdos for a first edition Base Charizard (then around $120, now about $300 or so, though I&#8217;d invite you to see that <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/Pokemon-/2610/i.html?_nkw=1st+edition+charizard">the offers I referenced don&#8217;t actually have any bids on them</a>, haha).  I used to go to Toys R US on Saturdays to participate in the Pokemon League Thing, where a lot of people gathered to fight each other.  I had a Psychic/Normal deck (because Psychic types were only weak to Psychic types, and because Normal types had a natural resistance to the Psychic types my Psychic Pokemon would be weak to, and because I didn&#8217;t have enough of any other Energy type with which to build a deck with).<br /><br />My most memorable battle is one that I waged against this much-older woman.  We both had one prize left.  She had an 80 HP Dragonair with 50 damage and had just knocked out one of my Pokemon.  I had a 50 HP Mew left, and with trepidation I placed it into battle position, or whatever that position is called where your Pokemon is placed when it is now ready to face off.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YHAhLwIyR7s/TqNkCn4lKuI/AAAAAAAAAfE/-67m2dvudTk/s1600/PZOP0075_500.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YHAhLwIyR7s/TqNkCn4lKuI/AAAAAAAAAfE/-67m2dvudTk/s320/PZOP0075_500.jpeg" width="230" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Mew (<a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?t=127345&amp;page=40">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I attached a Psychic energy to my Mew and with a small voice said, &#8220;I use Devolution Beam.&#8221;<br /><br />The woman shrugged.  &#8220;Alright.&#8221; She put the Dragonair back in her hand.  We stared at each other.  Finally I told her, &#8220;You&#8217;re dead.&#8221;<br /><br />Her devolved Dragonair had become a 40 HP Dratini with 50 points of damage on it.<br /><br />We shook hands.  Mine was shaking from the trauma of triumphing over a stranger so much older, and I don&#8217;t remember any battle after that one, though this is less because of fear and more because my father was tired of bringing me and my friends to Toys R Us on weekends and also remarked that Pokemon were a waste of money.  I looked down at the Typhlosion I had just gotten and realized, <em>Yeah.  This is kind of a waste of money</em>.<br /><br />Fast-forward to the present, where I realize Magic&#8217;s newest set, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innistrad">Innistrad</a>, features <em>werewolves</em>.  I <em>love</em> werewolves.  In the past I have not played Magic as much as I have admired and hungered over the art and flavor text of the cards.  I love how Magic creates its own narrative and fiction &#8211; when reading the cards&#8217; stories and abilities you can totally <em>feel</em> the power and coolness of each character, you can see yourself as mighty planeswalker summoning beings to wage battle, you can see this strange, dark dystopian country filled with girls that walk the night alone and turn into monsters when confronted by predators.  I&#8217;ve always just confined myself to just watching games and reading from the sidelines, but if Magic is going to have werewolves, well, shoot.  I&#8217;m not 11 years old anymore.  I have a job!<br /><br />And a healthy sense of beginner&#8217;s luck.  Every pack in Innistrad contains a rare card (either rare or the rarer &#8220;mythic rare&#8221;), as well as a shapeshifting card (either common, uncommon, or rare), and a potential holographic extra card (which itself can be common, uncommon, or rare/mythic rare).  In one pack I managed to score THREE RARES.  That&#8217;s the usual rare, a rare shapeshifter, and a holographic rare Stormkirk Noble.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x6U41JAUu-4/TqNsunj_TUI/AAAAAAAAAfc/uvyuGoahLuM/s1600/IMG_0087%255B1%255D.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x6U41JAUu-4/TqNsunj_TUI/AAAAAAAAAfc/uvyuGoahLuM/s320/IMG_0087%255B1%255D.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so beautiful. and blurry</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also got a card which depicted what I first described with delight as an Asian mage, until Andou heard me and exclaimed, &#8220;A <em>SNAPCASTER MAGE</em>?&#8221; Apparently this is one of the more valued cards of the set due to its Flash ability as well as its ability to allow its player to cast spells from the graveyard.  Since it is blue and I am primarily interested in red/green werewolves, it was mildly less exciting to receive, but hey!  It&#8217;s an Asian-looking mage.<br /><br />On a similar note, another thing that I like about the werewolves of Innistrad is that there are some female ones like <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=222111">Reckless Waif</a> and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=222118">Daybreak Ranger</a> which have cool costumes not as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_gaze#The_Male_Gaze_and_feminist_theory">male gaze</a>-y as, say, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230779">Crossway Vampire</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3TLuLmL8oug/TqNxvNZsRZI/AAAAAAAAAf0/h_ixxd_n6zk/s1600/reckless%2Bwaif.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="222" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3TLuLmL8oug/TqNxvNZsRZI/AAAAAAAAAf0/h_ixxd_n6zk/s320/reckless%2Bwaif.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Reckless Waif (<a href="http://www.blackborder.com/q/node/13241">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UqvV6PJlK2M/TqN4LWjd_-I/AAAAAAAAAgM/Q6pvPNlIPiw/s1600/5l0fgfboyl_en.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UqvV6PJlK2M/TqN4LWjd_-I/AAAAAAAAAgM/Q6pvPNlIPiw/s320/5l0fgfboyl_en.jpg" width="229" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Crossway Vampire (<a href="http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75842/28283735/ISD-ICD_Crossway_Vampire">source</a>, plus some bonus boob-filled discussion for your perusal)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also welcome the fact that these women, if a player does not cast a spell on their turn, then proceed during upkeep stage to turn into huge, powerful, vicious creatures that can&#8217;t be considered conventionally attractive in the same way the Undead women of WOW are.  I only compare them because I would expect a race like &#8220;Undead&#8221; to be, like werewolves, kind of horrific, or at least a little more horrific than their present depiction. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U7f0kUj-GyE/TqN1bL985EI/AAAAAAAAAgA/rv9PnbUzXCY/s1600/6a00d834515f7269e200e54f1659bd8834-640wi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U7f0kUj-GyE/TqN1bL985EI/AAAAAAAAAgA/rv9PnbUzXCY/s320/6a00d834515f7269e200e54f1659bd8834-640wi.jpg" width="319" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">yeah, i do consider big boobs, a thin figure, and full lips to be conventionally attractive (<a href="http://www.wonderlandblog.com/wonderland/2007/02/women_of_wow.html">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This reminds me that the first time that I visited our local card store and confessed to the proprietor that I wished to purchase a box of cards, he said, &#8221;<em>Why</em>?&#8221;<br /><br />His tone of voice was almost accusatory.  I&#8217;m not really an aggro type of person so I stammered with pseudo-wit, &#8220;Because &#8211; I &#8211; want to have fun &#8211;&#8221; and he waved me off with an explanation that he was joking.  He then asked Andou if he was teaching me how to play.<br /><br />Just a microaggression.  After all, he was just joking, right?  And my boyfriend <em>was</em> teaching me how to play right?  And girls <em>are</em> pretty rare in this scene, right?  Like, probably mythic rare.<br /><br />I guess I just like the idea that I should be able to go somewhere and spend $98 on cardboard without anyone having to tie my interests to a nearby boy.  And I also like the idea that people playing with these fancy cardboards should be able to see women on them whose appearance is not always tied to seduction of men.<br /><br />For now I give Local Card Store the benefit of the doubt, since the proprietor kindly let me choose which Innistrad box I wanted, and it turned out to be so filled with wonderful things, and also let me know about Friday night Magic gatherings which I may visit sometime if I can get over my general shyness about battling strangers, and also master the basics.  Last weekend, Andou and I went back to grab another Innistrad box, and this time the first booster that I opened had a <em>Liliana of the Veil.  Omg.  <a href="http://www.toywiz.com/mtginnistradlilianaoftheveil.html">What.</a></em><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kKMewAoNUOw/TqNsiQIS9GI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/AX313FQrg3Q/s1600/IMG_0091%255B1%255D.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kKMewAoNUOw/TqNsiQIS9GI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/AX313FQrg3Q/s320/IMG_0091%255B1%255D.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">36 Christmas presents</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It also contained another Snapcaster Mage and the true treasure, a holographic Kruin Outlaw for my werewolf deck.  This past weekend I put all my werewolves in red sleeves and put them in their own deckbox and then took them to work, which was kind of a silly move on my part because I don&#8217;t actually have anyone there to play with.  I feel like a dog with a stick and no one to play tug with.</div>

With much help from <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/">Alex</a> on the building of our trampoline web mechanic, I think we were able to make a pretty interesting game, one that I think would be fun to take to other places (if I ever find the time, gah).<br /><br />The theme of our game jam was &#8220;restraint,&#8221; which immediately made me think about spiderwebs, and from there me and my teammate came up with a cute story relating to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spider's_Thread">The Spider&#8217;s Thread</a>, which is an old Japanese short story.  From there I super focused on re-learning <a href="http://flixel.org/">Flixel</a>, and team-mate handled art assets and story, which luckily he was quite enthusiastic about.<br /><br />Flixel has a lot of cool things now, like an interactive debugger which acts as a trace log as well as a running poll for whatever variable you wish, and can also allow you to rewind and pause gameplay.  (To open it, press &#8220;~&#8221; while your game is running.) Luckily, it is easy to get the hang of, even when trying to remember how to make a FlxRect.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gFziC3DIE1I/TqEAEAHjgcI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/M9JF_rreJMc/s1600/proto4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gFziC3DIE1I/TqEAEAHjgcI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/M9JF_rreJMc/s320/proto4.png" width="212" /></a></div><br />Alex helped a ton with the web mechanic.  The idea is that the player would be able to draw webs between obstacles in order to propel themselves towards the heavens and nirvana.  However, the web for some reason wouldn&#8217;t anchor on some of the obstacles, so we secretly made it so that you could draw webs anywhere on the screen, and since we explained the mechanic as &#8220;Anchor your webs on obstacles!&#8221; no one knew the difference. :D<br /><br />Other interesting design-y things:<br /><ul><li>I initially wanted to make the obstacles randomly generate and fall down, but then we discussed what would happen if blocks fell in an unfortunate pattern that hemmed a player in, so we made the blocks breakable &#8211; hopefully allowing players to have a feeling of happiness when destroying something</li><li>This meant the player would need health to limit from just breaking through everything, and may have to make grueling decisions like &#8220;Should I just bust through this obstacle for mad points&#8221; or &#8220;Should I take the long route to replenish my health with a floating, rotating soda can&#8221;</li></ul><br />Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to revisit this project again sometime to really polish it up.  In the meantime, you can read more about this project and the other game jam projects on Fugazo&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fugazo.com/archives/1715">blog</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IsnU69WbRd8/TqMoufbw2FI/AAAAAAAAAes/4j2cpl2pRiM/s1600/proto7.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IsnU69WbRd8/TqMoufbw2FI/AAAAAAAAAes/4j2cpl2pRiM/s320/proto7.png" width="214" /></a></div></div>

Our CEO and one of the designers attended the conference and were subsequently impressed by the fact that many of the finalists, like Sissy’s Magical Ponycorn Adventure, had been created in one or two days during the <a href="http://arisgames.org/global-game-jam-2011/">2011 Global Game Jam</a>.<br /><br />So, now we&#8217;re having a company-wide game jam!<br /><br />I don&#8217;t yet have a &#8220;dedicated&#8221; programmer on my team, so I&#8217;m programming for myself.  I haven&#8217;t touched Flixel in 4 months but maybe if I hit myself against it hard enough, for for long enough, everything will be just fine.<br /><br />Our theme was &#8220;restraint&#8221; (a theme from a previous GGJ).  Our game&#8217;s present working title is just &#8220;Spider,&#8221; and I need to get back to it!<br /><br /><strong>Update:</strong> &#8220;Finished&#8221; game post is <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/10/game-itsy-bitsy-spider-of-cosmos.html">here</a>.</div>

Man, that jumping mechanic was hard to get the hang of.<br /><br />From the beginning I had a definite <em>Ender&#8217;s Game</em>-y feeling that my mission (something to the effect of &#8220;Go to an alien planet to disarm a bomb pointing at the earth!&#8221;) was not what it seemed.  Sober, slow piano does not exciting background music to alien killing make.  The hint/instruction system, in the form of your commander in the top-left corner, also plays its part distributing uneasy feelings: though the earth is in imminent danger, the commander does not worry about its people but rather spends time giving you instruction, praising you when you launch yourself aggressively at alien ships (<em>&#8220;Nice shot!&#8221;</em>), and grumbling when you reach new sectors in the alien world (e.g. <em>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never understand this place.</em>&#8221;).<br /><br />Still, I move on.  Why?  Because it&#8217;s a game, I guess.  It&#8217;s a challenge.  There are glowing things in the environment, that&#8217;s pretty nice.  Someone is telling me to press on.  It&#8217;s not quite the same as <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> where I can see my goal (sleeping there peacefully in the big main shrine), but as per your usual game, all you can do within its realm is move forward.<br /><br />The game rewards you at the end with a poem or song which speaks about how <em>sacrifice will always be remembered</em>, and it reminds me of <a href="http://gawker.com/5847338/steve-jobs-was-not-god">this article</a>&nbsp;on Gawker, about Steve Jobs&#8217; death:<br /><br /><blockquote>Real outpourings of public grief should be reserved for those people who lived life so heroically and selflessly that they stand as shining examples of love for all of humanity. People like, for example, the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, who—along with his family—was bombed, beaten, and stabbed during his years of principled activism in the US civil rights movement. Shuttlesworth died yesterday, the same day as Steve Jobs. He did not die a billionaire.<br /><br />All deaths are sad for the living. Everyone deserves to be mourned, and well-known people will inevitably be mourned more loudly than others. But it is actually important to keep our grief in perspective. When we start mourning technocrats as idols, we cheapen the lives of those who have sacrificed more for their fellow man.</blockquote><br />For me, there&#8217;s no constructive thought to be had in playing obituary olympics, but it does make me think more about what it means to &#8220;cheapen&#8221; someone&#8217;s life.  Is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Shuttlesworth">Reverend Shuttlesworth</a> cheapened because no one laid iPad candles on his grave?  In contrast, is Jobs&#8217; life posthumously enriched by the Tweets of gadget-wielding strangers?<br /><br />If life can be viewed as a brief (normal, chemical) candle flame, I think that the best way to cheapen it, to waste someone&#8217;s &#8220;sacrifice,&#8221; would be to let that person&#8217;s flame die out without ever touching yours.  It&#8217;s hard to imagine what I, as a Filipino girl, can do to feel or express what I would feel comfortable calling &#8220;true reverence&#8221; for the death of a black man activist minister who lived so far away.  Shuttlesworth&#8217;s (and Job&#8217;s) work might not have been done; but we continue it in doing the best by others, and by our selves.  All we can do is move forward.</div>

I&#8217;m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.  You&#8217;ve got to find what you love, and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers.  Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.  And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.  If you haven&#8217;t found it yet, keep looking, and don&#8217;t settle.  As with all matters of the heart, you&#8217;ll know when you find it.  And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.  So keep looking.  Don&#8217;t settle.<br /><br />Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.  You are already naked.  There is no reason not to follow your heart.</blockquote><br /><br />My first class this week for my HCDE program started with the usual ice breakers, and led eventually to our professor hauling out dozens of <em>Wired</em> magazines from the early 90s, just as oddly textured and bright neon as the <em>Wired</em> magazines of present day.  One of the first things that I saw in my Septemer 1998 issue was an advertisement for FAT32, Microsoft&#8217;s newest, fastest and most efficient file system.  One of the main features of this particular issue was Furby, and there was also a smaller article whose intent was to &#8220;debunk memes;&#8221; Bluetooth, it said, was estimated to be a hot topic for about the next 24 months, and would only really be marketable once portable devices like PDAs came to be everywhere.  <em>And even then, people looking to move data between gadgets might find it hard to sever their emotional connection to the entrenched wireline option.</em><br /><br />We started sharing articles.  Someone mentioned that in his issue, Apple was bringing back Steve Jobs as a consultant, and our professor said, &#8220;And that pretty much saved the company, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221;<br /><br />I guess it&#8217;s strange to think that this history of &#8220;silly technology&#8221; &#8211; digital cameras boasting a whole three feet of electrical cord, failed internet &#8220;walled gardens&#8221; like AOL and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)">Prodigy</a> &#8211; is really quite young.  The Macintosh computer (pitched to shareholders in 1984) was the first commercially successful computer with a graphical user interface, and that computer, for me, is the cornerstone of what I&#8217;m studying now.  Human-Computer Interaction is not only my academic focus but something that permeates <em>my life</em>; I am at a computer or interacting with things thanks to computers throughout my day more often than I am not.  Working, writing papers for class, corresponding, paying bills, learning about health insurance and oppression and red spider lilies&#8230;<br /><br />COOL MAN, STEVE.  I&#8217;m glad that technology&#8217;s history (and future?) is marked not with <em>Let&#8217;s use this to get all the money</em>, but rather with, <em>Let&#8217;s do this because this is what we love.</em></div>

<br />I&#8217;ve recently come into the bittersweet situation in which I am too busy actually doing things to write about them.<br /><br />In particular, since my new job at Fugazo reimbursed me for an iPod Touch, I have been playing tons of games on it, as well as exploring this previously mysterious world of being able to take pictures or video of whatever I want to on the fly.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OMKiFF1sHwg/ToecxPNVHVI/AAAAAAAAAdc/SSzbWDm5rh0/s1600/tumblr_ls8ry5Bjz11qdycalo1_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OMKiFF1sHwg/ToecxPNVHVI/AAAAAAAAAdc/SSzbWDm5rh0/s320/tumblr_ls8ry5Bjz11qdycalo1_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">not that my iPod is as good as my 35mm</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><h3>Hot Springs Story</h3>The first game that I ended up actually purchasing was <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id408854559">Hot Springs Story</a> (or, &#8220;SpaVille,&#8221; according to Andou).  It was developed by Kairosoft, which also made <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/game-dev-story/id396085661?mt=8">Game Dev Story</a>, beloved by so many real game developers.  I didn&#8217;t like Game Dev Story too much, but was immediately hooked by Hot Springs Story, due in the majority to this screenshot from <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2011/03/03/hot-springs-story-review/">Touch Arcade</a><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SscUwZBoLSE/ToefLRaWnTI/AAAAAAAAAdk/OWbpgtd5Vz0/s1600/mzl.pniydziy.320x480-75.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SscUwZBoLSE/ToefLRaWnTI/AAAAAAAAAdk/OWbpgtd5Vz0/s320/mzl.pniydziy.320x480-75.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://toucharcade.com/2011/03/03/hot-springs-story-review/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In Game Dev Story, you start out in a full, gray, square office.  In Hot Springs Story, you start out in this hardwood- and tatami-floor building which is both surrounded and filled by all these trees and blossoming plants which change their appearance throughout the season.  It&#8217;s also, to me, filled with less complexity in the beginning of the game; in GDS you&#8217;re immediately given all these options about what programmer to hire for your project, and all the potential programmers have all these different skills, and it&#8217;s so confusing.  What do these skills even mean yet?!<br /><br />HSS is pretty similar &#8211; a lot of the small icons aren&#8217;t understandable and a lot of the mechanics are something you grow into or discover later in game (for example, what &#8220;compatible facilities&#8221; are and what they do), but in HSS it felt a little more forgiving to make mistakes in the beginning.  The feeling of productivity also came more easily in HSS; you could set down trees and see the happy little &#8220;Scenery increased!&#8221; pop-ups, or else see people come in and level up in satisfaction, and so forth.<br /><br />I also started giving Pocket Academy a try today, but like GDS it has such a variety of options and &#8220;chances of messing up&#8221; from the very beginning that it almost stresses me out to play. Thanks to HSS, though, I think I&#8217;m getting the hang of Pocket Academy&#8217;s rules more easily, and I do like that Pocket Academy allows you to have a more personal connection with gameworld entities.  In HSS every guest is a faceless instance of a catergory of customers &#8211; a &#8220;Hiker,&#8221; a &#8220;Young Couple&#8221; &#8211; but in Pocket Academy every student and teacher has a name and a set of strengths and weaknesses which are all level-up-able.  You can even see which students are friends with which!  It&#8217;s a veritable Dwarf Fortress.<br /><br /><br /><h3>The Secret of Chateau de Moreau</h3><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mgiYp9F5XNs/Toer10BUzVI/AAAAAAAAAds/LP1UbeMdSVo/s1600/Chateau-De-Moreau1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="142" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mgiYp9F5XNs/Toer10BUzVI/AAAAAAAAAds/LP1UbeMdSVo/s320/Chateau-De-Moreau1.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://ifanzine.com/the-secret-of-chateau-de-moreau-giveaway-2-10-itunes-gift-cards-up-for-grabs">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Chateau de Moreau went on sale recently and after seeing something in a review to the effect of &#8220;this game is like Phoenix Wright&#8221; I grabbed it immediately.  It&#8217;s essentially an adventure game wrapped around a mystery.  The Count, your adoptive father, is dead; can you prove that you, the apparent inheritor of all his wealth, didn&#8217;t murder him?  It&#8217;s quite like Phoenix Wright in the conversations you get to have with characters and the dinner scenes each night, which are like the court scenes in Ace Attorney.  The characters are interesting to get to know, clichéd as some of them are (The Responsible Eldest Son, The Cheerful/Ditzy Maid).  My only problem with it thus far is that it&#8217;s too hard to move around the chateau using a touchscreen &#8211; I wish I could just click rooms and head directly to them, instead of clumsily moving the character through this sparse black-and-white overhead map step by step.  In fact, why does there need to be a map in the first place?  In the two hours that I&#8217;ve played the game thus far I can&#8217;t think of one instance in which I thought, <em>Wow, this is a great use of an overhead map that is nothing but white lines and text on a black background.</em><br /><br />The mansion has a ton of rooms, but only a subset of them are unlocked and actually visit-able in each chapter.  So why even show those other rooms?  Is the sense of the largeness of the chateau worth conveying hand-in-hand with the frustration that comes when all but four of the rooms of that huge chateau are inexplicably locked?<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>Sword and Sworcery</h3><br /><br /><center><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="265" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/10066962?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="400"></iframe><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/10066962">Walk in the Woods</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/sworcery">Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery </a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a></center><br /><br /><a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/">Alex</a> has been encouraging me to play this game for its <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/brainhex/seeker.html">Seeker</a> quality unusual to iOS games.  It is the type of game that is fun to just &#8221;<em>be</em> in&#8221; &#8211; to look at that calm forest all pixelated and yet somehow filled with so much depth.  The dialogue and world-building is also hilarious at times.  Scythians, dude.  They hate those rainbows.</div>
