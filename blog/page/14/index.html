  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<a href="http://www.spryfox.com/">Spry Fox</a> recently released their game Triple Town on iOS!  It lags a bit and takes time to load, but it&#8217;s a wonderful, addictive match-3-esque game.  It&#8217;s freemium; the first thousand or so &#8220;steps&#8221; are free, and you can purchase more steps with coins you earn as you complete levels.  Or, you can purchase the game for $3.99 in the App Store.<br /><br />You match three &#8220;Grass&#8221; to make a &#8220;Bush;&#8221; three &#8220;Bush&#8221; to make a &#8220;Tree;&#8221; three &#8220;Tree&#8221; to make a &#8220;House;&#8221; and so on.  Bears emerge randomly and three of them, trapped between landscape features, become gravestones that coalesce into a &#8220;Church.&#8221;  A starting board is a mostly-clear glade of grass and stones; successful boards are freckled with red-bricked civilization.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_Y2LY7M-xcQ/TzFgCE8mlvI/AAAAAAAAApE/7zu4Cj_O_LI/s640/blogger-image-1126259615.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_Y2LY7M-xcQ/TzFgCE8mlvI/AAAAAAAAApE/7zu4Cj_O_LI/s640/blogger-image-1126259615.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a screenshot of Triple Town</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I remember testing a bit of this game at the first <a href="http://www.seattleindies.org/">Seattle Indies</a> meet-up, and hearing Dan Cook tell me about how TT is at its heart <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/danctheduck/status/168044325006086144">a tragedy</a>.  The world starts bare and green, and inevitably you fill it with your colonization, reducing native bears to treasure-yielding clusters of churches.  I both appreciate this level of depth and am uncomfortable with this limited level of engagement of the important, sad, and real history of imperialism which still oppresses people today.  In this game there is nothing but to be the colonizer.  There is no success reachable through means alternative to keeping bears exactly where you want them, preventing movement until finally they homogenize into something beneficial to you.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OFKgNppvbDc/TzFgCoQT5tI/AAAAAAAAApM/iOp5cEdbdg8/s640/blogger-image--987295304.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OFKgNppvbDc/TzFgCoQT5tI/AAAAAAAAApM/iOp5cEdbdg8/s640/blogger-image--987295304.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">occupy, bears!!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Games go on until the entire board is filed with items, at which point any bears you have become gravestones and your score is tallied. &nbsp;Even when you lose, you still come away with something, whereas your &#8220;opponent&#8221;, the bears, will always die.<br /><br />It&#8217;s a wonderful game,&nbsp;<i>just</i> a game, <i>just</i> a brown bear and a gray headstone. &nbsp;But it does make me aware that some people can simply enjoy this game for what it is, even muse of its tragedy, and never have to feel like it&#8217;s their own.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
This past Superbowl Sunday a subset of ex-Dathouse roommates (plus me) got together, ate some chips, and had a draft!<br /><br />We went with three packs of Dark Ascension, which was a little &#8220;meh&#8221; since I feel unimpressed by DA rares. &nbsp;My first was a Fiend of Shadows that I passed up for a Lingering Souls. &nbsp;My second was Flayer of the Hatebound, and my third was Havengul Lich, which would have been<i>&nbsp;really</i>&nbsp;nice to open first&#8230;.aahhh. &nbsp;As it was, I had already drafted green/red/white, which is what I find myself doing 90% of the time. &nbsp;(But man, can you imagine a deck revolving around Havengul Lich and Hatebound? &nbsp;That would have been so fun! &nbsp;Casting low-cost creatures from the graveyard just to deal damage with Hatebound&#8230;I&#8217;d even passed on a Curse of Bloodletting at some point.)<br /><br />I started off unreasonably salty because Andy at my right had picked up all the Immerwolves I had hoped to get, but I ended up finishing second (to Andy!). &nbsp;I had three Nearheath Stalkers and a couple Flings which (when equipped with an Executioner&#8217;s Hood against a blue/black deck) put in the work.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HJlK3_DP4G0/TzDL7kJQ8GI/AAAAAAAAAo8/irHnIqXOBWA/s1600/nearheath-stalker.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HJlK3_DP4G0/TzDL7kJQ8GI/AAAAAAAAAo8/irHnIqXOBWA/s320/nearheath-stalker.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">have you ever looked closely at this art? &nbsp;it&#8217;s terrifying (<a href="http://theroundtablet.com/2012/01/10/nearheath-stalker-by-michael-c-hayes/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Since I didn&#8217;t have the Immerwolves, I experimented splashing white for a Niblis of the Urn, a pair of Burden of Guilts, and a Curse of Exhaustion, which I just wanted to play with. &nbsp;I managed to get it out once, but not during any clutch games. &nbsp;At the end of it all, Andou noted that in draft people often spend a lot of their mana playing one heavy drop during their turn, rendering something like Curse of Exhaustion not as useful.</div>

<i>This quarter I am facilitating a game design class at Puget Sound Community School for fun and lols. &nbsp;This is my story.</i><br /><br /><i>Other weeks can be found <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">here</a>.</i><br /><br />Last week&#8217;s game was <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/587905">/ ESCAPE \</a>. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a simple yet compelling game; you press the escape key to wall-jump, timing it right so you don&#8217;t get&nbsp;electrocuted&nbsp;by spikes embedded by the walls or the huge laser approaching you from the bottom.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_rajI-3FEw/T0pxVu3Q9mI/AAAAAAAAArg/iUKjsetx2c4/s1600/escapescreen.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_rajI-3FEw/T0pxVu3Q9mI/AAAAAAAAArg/iUKjsetx2c4/s400/escapescreen.png" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of / ESCAPE \</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The students said they could feel a sense of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>, and that when they lost, it was in a way so brief and shameless that they found themselves launching right back into the game again without really feeling like they had ever &#8220;stopped&#8221; playing. &nbsp;The fact that the music continued to play on even after death contributed to this, and someone pointed out that the background music made them want to tap ESC to the beat, which was relevant, because the topic of the day was sound.<br /><br />I started with asking what games they felt had strong &#8220;sound design,&#8221; whatever that means, and people listed off games like Metroid and Limbo for its sense of loneliness, Bioshock for its background music immersing you into its bygone pseudo-golden era. &nbsp;Andou supplied me with a particularly moving section of Limbo with which to show the class and everyone shuddered appreciatively.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/i3wmQb7LWZc" width="560"></iframe></center><br /><br />Some applications of sound that I found presented on the internets, as well as some that we brainstormed:<br /><br /><ul><li>Sound can make you feel emotional &#8211; sad, afraid, victorious</li><li>Sound can be used as positive or negative feedback &#8211; <i>You did something right!</i> &nbsp;Or, <i>NO, STOP IT</i></li><li>Sound can be used to give NPCs life, i.e. when they look over at your character dashing by them in a loud rush</li><li>Sound can be used as a reward, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgjHZa6Ag58">a la Zelda</a></li></ul>I also found and presented parts of&nbsp;<a href="http://cruiseelroy.net/2011/06/portal-2-music/">this very lovely breakdown</a>&nbsp;of what makes the music in Portal 2 so delightful and downright wonderful, which was good especially for me since I consider myself not extremely music-savvy, and I think would be hard-pressed at times to think about music and the effect that it&#8217;s having on me and my psyche. &nbsp;Contrast with Andou, who at any given moment during a game or movie will remark something like, &#8220;Oh look, it&#8217;s an intimate moment because romantic music is playing,&#8221; and I&#8217;ll realize that oh right, there <i>is</i>&nbsp;music playing.<br /><br />Following that article, I talked about encoded and embodied sounds, the ~*Universal Language*~ of music and how music in games, rather than speaking about the actions occurring <i>now</i>, may be more important in telling the player what will happen <i>next</i>: in the case of Limbo especially, blaring horns signal significant events, echoing splashes mean you&#8217;re moving deeper into an enormous lonely world.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

something called <a href="http://axcho.com/wordloops">Wordloops</a>, based on this year&#8217;s theme of &#8220;ouroboros.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is that you connect words together, starting the next word on the letter the previous word ended with, and after you fill certain criteria you &#8220;complete the loop&#8221; and proceed on to Loop N+1. &nbsp;Alex told me that it&#8217;s much better to make loops of small words, since you&#8217;re trying to get the most loops out of 3 minutes of play, but I personally found it really satisfying to make nice, long, wandering loops, and one of the students helped me see why: it&#8217;s because when you type a letter, a sound plays, and that sound goes higher the more letters you play. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the sound of <i>increasing</i>, <i>progressing,</i>&nbsp;<i>getting better</i>. &nbsp;And it&#8217;s at odds with the idea that<i>&nbsp;the smaller loop is best</i>.<br /><br />Sounds!<br /><b><br /></b><br /><b>Sources</b><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2263/gdc_2005_report_what_makes_music_.php">Gamasutra: GDC 2005 Report: What Makes Music for Games &#8216;Music For Games&#8217;</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2232/postcard_from_gdc_2005_gdc_mobile_.php">Gamasutra:&nbsp;Postcard From GDC 2005: GDC Mobile - Novel Ways to Use Audio in Games</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2189/enhancing_the_impact_of_music_in_.php">Gamasutra: Enhancing the Impact of Music in Drama-Oriented Games</a></li></ul></div>

I&#8217;ve started another story. &nbsp;I&#8217;m confident about this one. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t finish last year&#8217;s <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/2011-nanowrimo-limning.html">NaNo</a>&nbsp;but I&#8217;m&nbsp;placing my palms on it, shoving and shoving until its sputum can be resurrected as a passable plot.<br /><br />Mmm.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve discovered (not unexpectedly) that writing on the computer is, for me, a lost cause. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MyzI0jY_Bzk/TytZ60DNvkI/AAAAAAAAAos/Ch2z_vwGufc/s1600/472d84164e1a11e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MyzI0jY_Bzk/TytZ60DNvkI/AAAAAAAAAos/Ch2z_vwGufc/s320/472d84164e1a11e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i&#8217;m going to run out of moleskine soon</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There are too many distractions. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been weaned too well to the Information Age. &nbsp;A newly-transferred Twitter packet is the sweetest nectar. &nbsp;The &#8220;(1)&#8221; notification that appears to the left of the title of my Facebook tab sends my endorphins flying (though 90% of the time it&#8217;s just a request from CastleVille).<br /><br />I&#8217;ve also started assembling a playlist of songs Pandora has suggested to me, which I&#8217;ve found surprisingly stirring of the misery-hope emotions that fuel my inspiration so well. &nbsp;You can find it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD2A04B5DCB06A2D9">here</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLD2A04B5DCB06A2D9&amp;hl=en_US" width="560"></iframe></center><br /><br />Last but not least, an excerpt which I hope won&#8217;t jinx my endeavors:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;It will feel better once you open your eyes,&#8221; Candle suggested, sounding shameful now, &#8220;sorry I can&#8217;t keep it smooth,&#8221; but though Win indeed felt sick, she couldn&#8217;t bring herself to do it &#8211; to open her eyes, to look down and realize that she was miles away from home.  If she fell, how long would it take for her to return?  To fall past Quartzal and Agatava and all of Tenor Anthem, the journey that had taken days in elevators, in short trains weaving on zippered tracks past caves of stationary monsters, in carriages fixed to the back of cliffdragons whose gangly shoulderblades made the entire carriage sway as they navigated aggressive granite striae.  The journey of days could be undone in hours of freefall.  Minutes, if she didn&#8217;t hit anything.</blockquote></div>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e7bdL7k_Dc0/Tx5Y6nhukPI/AAAAAAAAAoE/Uj4vbQx1NIA/s1600/KT-slate-02-lg._V166940136_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="308" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e7bdL7k_Dc0/Tx5Y6nhukPI/AAAAAAAAAoE/Uj4vbQx1NIA/s320/KT-slate-02-lg._V166940136_.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eReader-eBook-Reader-e-Reader-Special-Offers/dp/B0051QVESA">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I thought that my loyalty to books would last &#8211; I thought I would shun anything else that lacked their comforting weight, their pulpy baleen. &nbsp;And still I found myself drawn uncomfortably to the Amazon page for the Kindle for months, thinking, <i>Should I&#8230;?</i><br /><br /><i>No way. &nbsp;There are already so many physical books! &nbsp;So many!</i><br /><br />I finally relented after realizing that you can read PDFs on a Kindle, which is nice because my course this quarter requires a <i>lot</i>&nbsp;of reading, most of which I can no longer print out for free at the CSE undergrad labs. &nbsp;Squinting at scanned inky text on a screen that can sear it into your vision long after you&#8217;ve actually stopped reading is unpleasant, and so, Kindle.<br /><br />I learned then quickly of the resources available to Kindle users who belong in my particular demographic, that is, a student in Seattle:<br /><br /><h3>  You can get Amazon Prime for half its normal yearly fee.</h3>Students can pay half the standard $80 fee per year for free two-day shipping and access to Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Lending Library, which can be browsed on a Kindle or online <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_nr_p_n_feature_browse-b_mrr_2?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_85%3A2470955011%2Cp_n_feature_browse-bin%3A618073011&amp;bbn=283155&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320670642&amp;rnid=618072011?tag=publishmarket-20">here</a>.  It says that you can borrow a book a month, but I think (<em>think</em>) that you can borrow a single book per month, but return it if you want to get another book before the time is up.  I am unclear on this and cannot completely verify yet, having difficulties finding the answer and also having not loaned out anything for a complete month yet.  The collection is enormous and what you&#8217;ll notice about it immediately is the presence of The Hunger Games, the poster child of the Lending Library, a little medal of, <em>Look!  There are even recent, popular books here!  For free (for $49/year)!</em><br /><br /><h3>  You can borrow ebooks from the Seattle Public Library.</h3>The waiting lists are long, but there are enough &#8220;unpopular&#8221; books to tide you over until the holds let up.  You can have holds on 25 books maximum.  You can borrow 25 books maximum, each for up to 21 days maximum.  Here&#8217;s the tricky thing that took me an annoying while to figure out: returning books is not done through the Seattle Public Library&#8217;s <a href="http://spl.lib.overdrive.com/">online site</a>, but through the &#8220;Manage Your Kindle&#8221; link on Amazon.com.<br /><br />Browsing the ebook collection is also frustratingly tedious &#8211; more on that later.  Suffice to say that browsing ebooks is something I reserve for mindlessly doing between builds.<br /><br /><h3>  There are tons of public domain books available on Amazon for free.</h3>They are odds and ends of things, but I really enjoy random tidbits like <em>Character</em> and <em>Home Vegetable Gardening -a Complete and Practical Guide to the Planting and Care of All Vegetables, Fruits and Berries Worth Growing for Home Use</em>, so, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/The%20http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;node=154606011&amp;redirect=true&amp;sort=daterank&amp;field-price=0-0">there</a> you go!</div>
