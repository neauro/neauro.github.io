From <em>Re-Space-ing Place: &#8220;Place&#8221; and &#8220;Space&#8221; Ten Years On</em>:<br /><blockquote>My goal [in this paper] is to understand two related developments over the last decade. <strong>One is the way in which the conceptual distinction between place and space has been taken up by [computer-supported cooperative work] researchers</strong>, and to see what kinds of light we might be able to cast on this by returning to the roots of this distinction in fields such as geography and urban studies that have something to say about the social organization of spaces. The other is the ways in which our heightened understanding of the issues of mobility and information as an aspect of everyday life, emerging out of studies and experiences with mobile technologies, might reinvigorate a conceptual exploration of questions of practice and spatiality, and help us deepen our understandings of the implications of arguments about place and space.<br /></blockquote><br />I&#8217;m always surprised by HCI&#8217;s pure ability to study People Doing Things, whether its people out living their lives in the world, or <em>other people studying HCI.</em></div>

Bus drivers in Seattle will sometimes talk to passengers as they enter the bus.  As passengers step up, the drivers will put their hands over the little fare box to obstruct it, and repeat, loudly, &#8220;Pay as you leave.  <em>Pay as you leave.  PAY AS YOU LEAVE.</em>&#8221;<br /><br />Alas!  It&#8217;s too late.  The person was talking on their cellphone and already swiped their Orca card on the Orca card reader.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bC74HOcr-8/UCLmDvd3phI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/U-4kald-qnA/s1600/3465566019_86060511e0.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bC74HOcr-8/UCLmDvd3phI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/U-4kald-qnA/s320/3465566019_86060511e0.jpg" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">photo by JeanineAnderson (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeanineanderson/3465566019/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After doing this, the bus driver will usually just sigh.<br /><br />Orca is (essentially) just a fancy debit card for public transportation in some counties around southern Puget Sound.  To use, you fill it up with money and then press it against the Orca card reader, which is located further away than the bus driver can reach to block it from hasty passengers responding to habit and the design of the bus entranceway.  Swiping your Orca card incorrectly may result in some weird things happening with your fare (things possibly related to how your transfers are monitored), and though I don&#8217;t know the exact repercussions of paying when you enter the bus instead of when you exit, it is kind of sad to see bus drivers being frustrated with this, especially since I learned in an Informatics class last year that bus drivers have some pretty serious rules governing their work.<br /><br />Also especially since I feel like there are a couple ways you could mitigate this frustration:<br /><ul><li><strong>Move the Orca card reader closer to the bus driver.</strong>  Then the bus driver could reach over and cover the card reader much in the same way I see them covering the fare box.  I think this could be the least expensive solution.</li><li><strong>If someone tries to pay when they are not supposed to, the Orca reader shouldn&#8217;t charge them.</strong>  There are already <a href="http://www.onebusaway.org/">technologies</a> in use that make use of what I assume is a capability to know where a bus is at a certain time, which could be used to know when people should be charged, and for what rate.  (Presently drivers fiddle with the Orca card readers to make sure that people get charged properly, which seems like it may be an unnecessary task.) People try to pay for the bus all the time in the Ride Free area and it doesn&#8217;t matter how many nice, green &#8220;Ride Free&#8221; signs there are, they just don&#8217;t read &#8211; so just account for it.  Extra advantage: bus driver thinks less about fares in general, and more about just driving.  (Disadvantage: This doesn&#8217;t account for cash fares.  Also, how are you really supposed to know when people are entering or exiting, to figure out whether they should be charged?<ul><li>Use cameras to measure differences in position to determine a passenger&#8217;s direction?</li><li>Count the number of times a door opens and closes?</li><li>Or, since you don&#8217;t really need to touch Orca cards directly to the Orca card reader and James keeps talking about how easy it is to sniff data from Orca cards, maybe the transaction should just happen as people are standing on the bus, so they don&#8217;t pause to pay with an Orca at all.  Thus you could have something like: a) Charge everyone as they get on the bus, b) If a person leaves the bus in a Ride Free area, put the money back on the card, c) Else, if the person leaves the bus after leaving the Ride Free Area, just leave the charge on the card.)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Granted, these are all probably past the power of our struggling transportation system (though I admit I only describe as struggling due to <a href="http://seattlebikeblog.com/2011/11/09/seattles-prop-1-soundly-defeated/">Prop. 1</a> failing recently and grumbling anecdotes on Facebook about the inefficiency of buses).</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Last week I was convinced to join another tourney at The Dreaming, this time for constructed decks (i.e. decks that you make beforehand with love and high hopes, versus <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/bx-mz7fg7.html">drafted</a> decks).  I say &#8220;convinced&#8221; because I was not planning on participating but rather on sitting on the sidelines writing <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/2011-nanowrimo-limning.html">NaNo</a> and challenging people to friendlies, but then the store worker person came around and said that they were one person short for the &#8220;casual&#8221; tourney (which is a little more low-key than the &#8220;competitive&#8221; tourney, and everyone comes away with a prize of some sort), so I was like, Alright, fine, why not?<br /><br />(Later, I realized that in the first round of the casual tourney, Andou had gotten a by.  Which meant that they actually had the right amount of people for a tourney!  Wat!)<br /><br /><a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/silly-werewolf-deck-v2.html">Werewolf deck</a> was fun (as usual) but I ended up winning only one of my matches, against someone who purportedly threw his deck together for lols and was planning to dismantle it immediately after the tourney.<br /><br />Themes I noticed/learned:<br /><ul><li><strong>I was able to consistently pull off <em>super</em> strong openings</strong>, to the extent that people I was playing against would sigh and say &#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re going to win this one&#8221; before thoroughly putting me down some turns later.  Still, dat strong opening!  Turn 1 Reckless Waif, turn 2 transform and play Full Moon&#8217;s Rise and swing for 4.  <em>Go Waif go!</em></li><li><strong>One of the most stark problems I had was resisting creature spot removal</strong>, i.e. that one match where the guy kept using Arc Trail to pick off my werewolves and then hitting me and then putting out Stormblood Berserker, ugh.  Not to mention that he would usually be able to play multitudes of spells which could either prevent transformation or force it back to humans.</li><li><strong>You can target Illusions with Kessig Wolf Run to kill them!</strong>  That&#8217;s pretty useful.</li><li>Also useful (though not for me): cards like Ratchet Bomb, which can destroy things with 0 mana cost for free.  <strong>Apparently werewolves in transformed form technically have 0 mana cost</strong> and can therefore instantly die.  Blagh.</li></ul><br />In the end, all was well and good because I still got a foil <a href="http://magiccards.info/zen/en/170.html">Nissa Revane</a> (though it&#8217;s already rotated out of standard and can&#8217;t be played legally in formal tourneys anymore, I guess) and Andou (who won the entire tourney) opened up a foil Instigator Pack which I instantly begged for and received.  Werewolves &lt;3<br /><br />Afterward and over the weekend I played more and came up with more ideas about improving upon Werewolf Deck in general:<br /><br /><ul><li><strong>Birds of Paradise.</strong>  Why?  Because Turn 1 Forest and Birds.  Turn 2, Mountain, and tap all three lands for Daybreak Ranger.  Turn 3, some other land, then tap four for Instigator Gang.  Oh, what?  Your 0/1 Birds can now attack as a 1/1 (or 3/1, if Instigator is transformed)?!</li><li><strong>Spellskite.</strong>  You can use it to pay two life and have any spell or ability&#8217;s target changed to Spellskite, which is a 0/4 too meaty for a single shot with Incinerate, Shock, etc.  Plus it&#8217;s only a 2 drop, which means you can get a really good, cheap defender which can keep werewolves alive from all that sniping!  Cons: It&#8217;s popular in general and therefore about $10 a pop.  Bleh.</li><li><strong>Mask of Avacyn?</strong>  Pro: Also can prevent sniping of werewolves, and also gives extra defense, which wolves lack.  Con: It&#8217;s expensive (2 to summon, 3 to equip) and I haven&#8217;t yet used it successfully.</li><li><strong>Less Daybreaks and Kruins,</strong> i.e. maybe not a set of each in my deck, because I keep getting them in my opening hand an wishing I had either or instead.  Dang you, $1 MTG binder that had Daybreaks.  I was so excited to have as many as possible.</li><li><strong>Red Sun Zenith?</strong>  Because against decks that just fatten the heck up, it&#8217;s hard to find anything to kill large creatures.  Cons: It&#8217;s a sorcery, so, no transformation on the turn I might need it.</li></ul><br /><br />One of the better ways of thinking of ways to improve Werewolf Deck would probably be to find some award-winning werewolf deck online, but I kind of enjoy doing it on my own.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Two weeks ago I attended my first Magic: The Gathering draft tournament at The Dreaming.<br /><br />This is how you draft:<br /><ol><li>Pay some money.  This money pays for 3 booster packs.</li><li>Sit around a table with some other people, all of which also have 3 booster packs.</li><li>Open a pack.</li><li>Select a card from the pack.</li><li>Give the person on your right or left the rest of the cards from this pack.  You too will receive a set of cards from someone on your right or left.</li><li>Select another card.</li><li>Repeat until all cards are gone; then open another booster pack, and repeat until all cards are gone; etc.</li><li>Once you have made your selections, create a deck, using an &#8220;infinite&#8221; stock of mana from the host.</li><li>After that, battle!</li></ol><br />The first rare card that I got was an Angel of Flight Alabaster, so I started grabbing all the spirits and white creatures in general I could find, then eventually split into grabbing red creatures as well, mostly vampires and also a holographic Village Ironsmith that I couldn&#8217;t resist.  (Werewolves &lt;3)<br /><br />I ended up only winning one match that night (against Kelly and his preponderance of Unruly Mobs) but still got away with an extra booster pack as a prize, which is not bad.  It was pretty fun to play with new people in general, though I tend to be pretty shy and besides that forget a lot of rules.  In particular I&#8217;m not yet used to declaring everything that I&#8217;m doing, or in responding to things in a timely manner, so people would declare attackers, I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Uh?  Okay,&#8221; and then they&#8217;d just go on and attack before I realized that that was the time I was supposed to tap things out with Avacynian Priest so that they wouldn&#8217;t deal me damage.<br /><br />Cool.<br /><br />Things to remember for next time:<br /><ul><li>One drops are important for constructed decks, but not really for limited decks, I guess.  I imagine that&#8217;s because getting your &#8220;fatty creatures&#8221; out is more successful in the long run than nicking away at someone at the beginning of the game?  Those Selfless Cathars and Doomed Travelers sure came in handy, though.</li>  <li>Geistflame and Feeling of Dread were so useful, <em>wow</em>.  The first because it&#8217;s so low cost and has Flashback, which means I have potential removal <em>twice</em>.  The second because it really seemed to frustrate people when I used it, haha.</li>  <li>A better deck will have a good focus, i.e. if you decide on getting things like Lumberknot, keep in mind that you will want to kill creatures, and pick out cards accordingly.</li>  <li><a href="http://www.magicdraftsim.com/">Practice more!</a></li>  </ul></div>

I haven&#8217;t done <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> before because it&#8217;s an event that seems to me to stress quantity over quality, and if there&#8217;s something that I know I&#8217;ve been doing since I was in junior high, it&#8217;s writing a lot.  I have hundreds of pages of 8.5pt Verdana Word Documents, for a story that I would still consider myself in the process of writing, though it&#8217;s undergone pretty drastic changes since back then (most of them for the good).  My old .doc files that contain culled stuff (just in case) is longer than the actual story itself.  I mean, I started writing a <em>sequel</em> to this story before it was even finished.  (O you eighth grade self!)<br /><br />So, I don&#8217;t usually feel accomplished if I reach a certain count of words.<br /><br />That being said, I don&#8217;t usually feel accomplished either if I don&#8217;t write anything at all, so in between work, school, and bouts of Magic I&#8217;ve been chipping away at my own NaNo.  I&#8217;ve fallen a bit behind but am certain I can catch up over Thanksgiving break.<br /><br />&#8230;but only if I can&#8217;t get a copy of Skyward Sword. o___o<br /><br />The story itself is set in Anthem, the of my semi-inactive <a href="http://opalitewires.blogspot.com/">Opalite Wires</a> writing practice blog thing.<br /><br />Here are the first two paragraphs:<br /><br /><blockquote>In Quartzal, the gravity was a little lighter than usual.  This is why it was the main Lower Anthem district for the passerine, who find their flight more easily won in the skies there; a few powerful rows and you’re off, unlike in lower districts where some passerine struggle or else don’t visit at all.  A favorite tagline for passerine tourist was that in Quartzal, one’s wings often open by themselves, which indeed seems to be the case, especially in narrow restaurants where this sort of abrupt twitch can be taken very poorly.  The most popular restaurant in Quartzal served soup comprising a variety of things harvested from the explored regions of Anthem (fungus from Slatemet, cuttles from Obsidash, lightning from Tonsor) in tiny pots balanced on the backs of salamanders, who especially didn’t take kindly to abrupt movements.  Singed tongues, brows, and too much ruined furniture led the proprietors of that particular store to adopt a bound-wing policy, in which winged guests such as the passerine would be required to don a semi-attractive set of belts that had been repurposed to hold wings shut in the unfortunate but inevitable event that Quartzal’s mysterious lightness would force them open.<br /><br />It was one of the few places where rain was welcomed; for with the biannual season of downpours came a great amount of mud, which transformed choking crystalline dust into fine pearly mud that passersby were loathe to scrub from their vehicles, whether they were carriages or cycles or the long, equinal dragons that were the present fashionable mount of Quartzal’s earth-bound bipedal beings.  Rain that fell from beyond the perimeters of the district Quartzal was the only kind of liquid which would render the dirt of Quartzal in this way; water that had been stored in cisterns for the dry season would fail to bring about the same effect, as would water hauled from the lower oceans, as far below as Coralanem, where indeed someone had tried to harvest the water that loved its depth so much it would struggle against the vases of abductors with churning and hisses.  It had to be rain - rain fallen fresh and cool from the skies, water that had rested in the clouds for so long that it had forgotten everything but dozing in the breeze, sometimes calm, sometimes with fits.</blockquote></div>

Yeah!  I actually really wanted to make &quot;Her Will&quot; into a Flash platformer (http://neauro.com/content/writing/herwill/writing.pdf) but couldn&#39;t quite think of a good mechanic to build around.  You should let me know if you come up with any ideas!  I&#39;d be up for doing fun storygame stuff outside of normal work.</div>

Werewolf deck is getting more complete than it was <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/10/silly-werewolf-decklist.html">before</a>, thanks to trades and gifts from Chris and Edison-san!<br /><br />Here&#8217;s the newer version:<br /><br /><br /><strong>Creatures</strong><br />4x Reckless Waif<br />4x Kruin Outlaw<br />3x Instigator Gang<br />2x Daybreak Ranger<br />4x Mayor of Avabruck<br />2x Gatstaf Shepherd<br /><br /><strong>Spells/Artifacts</strong><br />2x Ranger&#8217;s Guile<br />4x Full Moon&#8217;s Rise<br />4x Moonmist<br />3x Incinerate<br />3x Shock<br /><br /><strong>Lands</strong><br />4x Rootbound Crag<br />2x Kessig Wolf Run<br />1x Copperline Gorge<br />10x Mountain<br />8x Forest<br /><br /><br />Also, reasons why:<br /><ul><li>No more red two drops in the form of Village Ironsmith, but given the choice of having Village Ironsmith or Kruin Outlaw, I&#8217;d always want Kruin, even if it took another turn to get out.</li><li>I initially had some Prey Upons as kill cards, but the problem with them is that they are Sorceries, which means I need to play them on my turn if I ever want to use them &#8211; my precious turn, which I could have instead used to play nothing, in order to transform wolves.  Awoooo~</li><li>Incinerates/Shocks are Instants and can be played on the opponent&#8217;s turn, which means I can skip my own turn to go wolves, then still kill things.  Hurray!  (To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure why I didn&#8217;t have many of these earlier.)</li><li>Less Instigator Gang: because Andou explained to me that when you get 4 of something, that means that you usually want a high chance of getting that card on your opening hand, and Instigator Gang (with a cost of 4 mana) is really more of a later-game thing.</li><li>Max Mayor of Avabruck: because he&#8217;s a two drop which can buff either humans or werewolves, and also potentially generate 3/3 Wolf tokens in the end step, which can block hits on the opponent&#8217;s next turn if I happen to go all in with werewolves at the end of my turn.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FrivM_1Q3zk/TrijFXjAuKI/AAAAAAAAAhM/TZTkhlZJeQU/s1600/827_mayorofavabruck_alt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="251" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FrivM_1Q3zk/TrijFXjAuKI/AAAAAAAAAhM/TZTkhlZJeQU/s320/827_mayorofavabruck_alt.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">and how can you say no to this mustache?<br />(<a href="http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/donath.html">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li>No more Manabarbs: because I really wanted them to be successful, but I was never able to pull them off.  I guess the problem is that with werewolves you really have to watch your spell usage in general, and if it&#8217;s my turn I&#8217;d rather be playing Full Moon&#8217;s Rise, or another werewolf.</li><li>No more Caravan vigil or Traveler&#8217;s Amulet or Shimmering Grotto: because those were really just there as substitutes for Rootbound Crags or Copperline Gorges, which I now have 4 and 1 of, respectively.  Both can tap for red or green, but Rootbound Crag will come into play tapped if you do not already control a Forest or Mountain, and Copperline Gorge will come into play tapped if you already have more than two lands in general.  It is a little weird to have just one Copperline Gorge; on one hand I&#8217;d benefit by having a lot of them because then I&#8217;d be sure to get them in an opening hand (meaning they would be able to come into play untapped), on the other hand I&#8217;d have a lot of them, and even if I got them in my first hand, that would mean that one of them would definitely come into play tapped.</li></ul><br />Thus far werewolf deck is faring pretty well against Andou&#8217;s white token deck and is kinda-sorta even with his white/green humans.  I&#8217;m not sure how to improve upon it anymore, except to keep balancing mana; I recently took out a Shock and an Incinerate and replaced them with more land, but then felt like I was getting gluts of useless land every turn when really a burning spell would have been nice.  So it goes.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Two weekends ago, I did what I said I would never do.<br /><br />I bought a box of Magic: The Gathering cards.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Am5D7PU8S4M/TqNJRm0wFcI/AAAAAAAAAe4/z5RkvDWsx0c/s1600/IMG_0086%255B1%255D.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Am5D7PU8S4M/TqNJRm0wFcI/AAAAAAAAAe4/z5RkvDWsx0c/s320/IMG_0086%255B1%255D.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">faux depth-of-field courtesy of<a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Back in the day I was unreasonably obsessed with the Pokemon TCG.  To this day I remember a couple of my more memorable trades in Latchkey &#8211; a Dewgong and a Machoke for a Clefairy, a Zapdos for a first edition Base Charizard (then around $120, now about $300 or so, though I&#8217;d invite you to see that <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/Pokemon-/2610/i.html?_nkw=1st+edition+charizard">the offers I referenced don&#8217;t actually have any bids on them</a>, haha).  I used to go to Toys R US on Saturdays to participate in the Pokemon League Thing, where a lot of people gathered to fight each other.  I had a Psychic/Normal deck (because Psychic types were only weak to Psychic types, and because Normal types had a natural resistance to the Psychic types my Psychic Pokemon would be weak to, and because I didn&#8217;t have enough of any other Energy type with which to build a deck with).<br /><br />My most memorable battle is one that I waged against this much-older woman.  We both had one prize left.  She had an 80 HP Dragonair with 50 damage and had just knocked out one of my Pokemon.  I had a 50 HP Mew left, and with trepidation I placed it into battle position, or whatever that position is called where your Pokemon is placed when it is now ready to face off.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YHAhLwIyR7s/TqNkCn4lKuI/AAAAAAAAAfE/-67m2dvudTk/s1600/PZOP0075_500.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YHAhLwIyR7s/TqNkCn4lKuI/AAAAAAAAAfE/-67m2dvudTk/s320/PZOP0075_500.jpeg" width="230" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Mew (<a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?t=127345&amp;page=40">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I attached a Psychic energy to my Mew and with a small voice said, &#8220;I use Devolution Beam.&#8221;<br /><br />The woman shrugged.  &#8220;Alright.&#8221; She put the Dragonair back in her hand.  We stared at each other.  Finally I told her, &#8220;You&#8217;re dead.&#8221;<br /><br />Her devolved Dragonair had become a 40 HP Dratini with 50 points of damage on it.<br /><br />We shook hands.  Mine was shaking from the trauma of triumphing over a stranger so much older, and I don&#8217;t remember any battle after that one, though this is less because of fear and more because my father was tired of bringing me and my friends to Toys R Us on weekends and also remarked that Pokemon were a waste of money.  I looked down at the Typhlosion I had just gotten and realized, <em>Yeah.  This is kind of a waste of money</em>.<br /><br />Fast-forward to the present, where I realize Magic&#8217;s newest set, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innistrad">Innistrad</a>, features <em>werewolves</em>.  I <em>love</em> werewolves.  In the past I have not played Magic as much as I have admired and hungered over the art and flavor text of the cards.  I love how Magic creates its own narrative and fiction &#8211; when reading the cards&#8217; stories and abilities you can totally <em>feel</em> the power and coolness of each character, you can see yourself as mighty planeswalker summoning beings to wage battle, you can see this strange, dark dystopian country filled with girls that walk the night alone and turn into monsters when confronted by predators.  I&#8217;ve always just confined myself to just watching games and reading from the sidelines, but if Magic is going to have werewolves, well, shoot.  I&#8217;m not 11 years old anymore.  I have a job!<br /><br />And a healthy sense of beginner&#8217;s luck.  Every pack in Innistrad contains a rare card (either rare or the rarer &#8220;mythic rare&#8221;), as well as a shapeshifting card (either common, uncommon, or rare), and a potential holographic extra card (which itself can be common, uncommon, or rare/mythic rare).  In one pack I managed to score THREE RARES.  That&#8217;s the usual rare, a rare shapeshifter, and a holographic rare Stormkirk Noble.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x6U41JAUu-4/TqNsunj_TUI/AAAAAAAAAfc/uvyuGoahLuM/s1600/IMG_0087%255B1%255D.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x6U41JAUu-4/TqNsunj_TUI/AAAAAAAAAfc/uvyuGoahLuM/s320/IMG_0087%255B1%255D.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so beautiful. and blurry</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also got a card which depicted what I first described with delight as an Asian mage, until Andou heard me and exclaimed, &#8220;A <em>SNAPCASTER MAGE</em>?&#8221; Apparently this is one of the more valued cards of the set due to its Flash ability as well as its ability to allow its player to cast spells from the graveyard.  Since it is blue and I am primarily interested in red/green werewolves, it was mildly less exciting to receive, but hey!  It&#8217;s an Asian-looking mage.<br /><br />On a similar note, another thing that I like about the werewolves of Innistrad is that there are some female ones like <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=222111">Reckless Waif</a> and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=222118">Daybreak Ranger</a> which have cool costumes not as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_gaze#The_Male_Gaze_and_feminist_theory">male gaze</a>-y as, say, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230779">Crossway Vampire</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3TLuLmL8oug/TqNxvNZsRZI/AAAAAAAAAf0/h_ixxd_n6zk/s1600/reckless%2Bwaif.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="222" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3TLuLmL8oug/TqNxvNZsRZI/AAAAAAAAAf0/h_ixxd_n6zk/s320/reckless%2Bwaif.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Reckless Waif (<a href="http://www.blackborder.com/q/node/13241">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UqvV6PJlK2M/TqN4LWjd_-I/AAAAAAAAAgM/Q6pvPNlIPiw/s1600/5l0fgfboyl_en.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UqvV6PJlK2M/TqN4LWjd_-I/AAAAAAAAAgM/Q6pvPNlIPiw/s320/5l0fgfboyl_en.jpg" width="229" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Crossway Vampire (<a href="http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75842/28283735/ISD-ICD_Crossway_Vampire">source</a>, plus some bonus boob-filled discussion for your perusal)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also welcome the fact that these women, if a player does not cast a spell on their turn, then proceed during upkeep stage to turn into huge, powerful, vicious creatures that can&#8217;t be considered conventionally attractive in the same way the Undead women of WOW are.  I only compare them because I would expect a race like &#8220;Undead&#8221; to be, like werewolves, kind of horrific, or at least a little more horrific than their present depiction. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U7f0kUj-GyE/TqN1bL985EI/AAAAAAAAAgA/rv9PnbUzXCY/s1600/6a00d834515f7269e200e54f1659bd8834-640wi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U7f0kUj-GyE/TqN1bL985EI/AAAAAAAAAgA/rv9PnbUzXCY/s320/6a00d834515f7269e200e54f1659bd8834-640wi.jpg" width="319" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">yeah, i do consider big boobs, a thin figure, and full lips to be conventionally attractive (<a href="http://www.wonderlandblog.com/wonderland/2007/02/women_of_wow.html">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This reminds me that the first time that I visited our local card store and confessed to the proprietor that I wished to purchase a box of cards, he said, &#8221;<em>Why</em>?&#8221;<br /><br />His tone of voice was almost accusatory.  I&#8217;m not really an aggro type of person so I stammered with pseudo-wit, &#8220;Because &#8211; I &#8211; want to have fun &#8211;&#8221; and he waved me off with an explanation that he was joking.  He then asked Andou if he was teaching me how to play.<br /><br />Just a microaggression.  After all, he was just joking, right?  And my boyfriend <em>was</em> teaching me how to play right?  And girls <em>are</em> pretty rare in this scene, right?  Like, probably mythic rare.<br /><br />I guess I just like the idea that I should be able to go somewhere and spend $98 on cardboard without anyone having to tie my interests to a nearby boy.  And I also like the idea that people playing with these fancy cardboards should be able to see women on them whose appearance is not always tied to seduction of men.<br /><br />For now I give Local Card Store the benefit of the doubt, since the proprietor kindly let me choose which Innistrad box I wanted, and it turned out to be so filled with wonderful things, and also let me know about Friday night Magic gatherings which I may visit sometime if I can get over my general shyness about battling strangers, and also master the basics.  Last weekend, Andou and I went back to grab another Innistrad box, and this time the first booster that I opened had a <em>Liliana of the Veil.  Omg.  <a href="http://www.toywiz.com/mtginnistradlilianaoftheveil.html">What.</a></em><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kKMewAoNUOw/TqNsiQIS9GI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/AX313FQrg3Q/s1600/IMG_0091%255B1%255D.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kKMewAoNUOw/TqNsiQIS9GI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/AX313FQrg3Q/s320/IMG_0091%255B1%255D.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">36 Christmas presents</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It also contained another Snapcaster Mage and the true treasure, a holographic Kruin Outlaw for my werewolf deck.  This past weekend I put all my werewolves in red sleeves and put them in their own deckbox and then took them to work, which was kind of a silly move on my part because I don&#8217;t actually have anyone there to play with.  I feel like a dog with a stick and no one to play tug with.</div>
