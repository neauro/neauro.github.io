  <h3><em>Dream Builder</em> and <em>Elements</em></h3>

  <p>
  <em>Dream Builder: Amusement Park</em> is a casual simulation PC game where players create an amusement park. I led design for a team of four artists and one programmer. I also programmed UI and UI animations, and oversaw overall scheduling as well as in-house playtests.

  While working at Fugazo, I also oversaw the design and concept of an unreleased casual hidden-object game with the working title “<em>Elements</em>.”

  <h3>Player Feedback on <em>Dream Builder</em></h3>
  <blockquote>
    “I played this game on a Beta test a month ago, and have been anxiously awaiting the finished product to appear on Big Fish. I was so happy to see it there today. I did the trial hour before buying just to make sure that I liked all the changes that had been made. I was not disappointed. It is a fantastic [time management] Game.”
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    “This has been a complete joy to play. I own many amusement park building games and usually after awhile I have to take a break but I couldn't stop playing this one. It has SO many different things to it it's hard to understand how someone can stop or dislike it.”
