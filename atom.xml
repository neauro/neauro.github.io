<p><em>Thomas Was Alone</em> was super cute, if more ambiguous than I personally like. I liked the personality given to all the different shapes, though their common heroism and conceit got a little old as the game went on, which was why Laura&rsquo;s cynicism made her my favorite (though I felt compelled inexlicably to keep calling her &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo;). I loved that the levels were tilted, the play of light, the strange colors. (Though I wonder if any colorblind users had a hard time playing?)</p>

<p>One thing I think the game could have been improved was the game&rsquo;s sense of progression; though numbers ticked up each level, after a while they became meaningless, and now that the game is finished I&rsquo;m not totally sure what I would use them for. The introduction of each of the colored shapes, Thomas&rsquo;s &ldquo;death,&rdquo; and the era of the gray shapes seemed to be the largest movements in the story, and though each was accompanied with a fun snippet of &ldquo;The AIs are gaining sentience!&rdquo; flavor I didn&rsquo;t really have a sense that things were reaching their end until the end came suddenly to meet me. Some levels seemed like little &ldquo;drabbles&rdquo; and experiments, which I completed without much more effort than would take for me to click a cow in Farmville, and it would have been cool to see something else related to AIs breaking their previous ways of being. Breaking through the borders of levels — intentionally disobeying orders — something to add to the flavor text.</p>

<p>I played <em>Thomas Was Alone</em> on a projector and if you have the opportunity to do so yourself I recommend it. All those rectangles are like way better when they&rsquo;re as big as your face.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been putting off getting a virtual machine running on the Mac computer I use for work, mostly because I wanted to forget the existence of &lt;IE9 browsers entirely. Unfortunately, the visual bugs accumulating across my projects were starting to get a little ridiculous.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://neauro.github.io/images/proleft.png" alt="Screenshot of IE8 errors"/></p>

<p class="caption">omg why</p>


<p>After some hours of searching and fiddling, I discovered my favorite solution for running IE on a Mac. It goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the relevant/recent version of Oracle&#8217;s <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>.</li>
<li>Use the Terminal and and run <code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | env IEVMS_VERSIONS="8 9" bash</code> to download 2 virtual machines; one that can run IE8, and one that can run IE9.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s it! Once that&rsquo;s finished, you can open VirtualBox and you&rsquo;ll see your boxes all ready to go.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://neauro.github.io/images/virtualbox.png" alt="Screenshot of IE8 in VirtualBox"/></p>

<p>Other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>border-radius</code>, <code>rem</code>, and <code>opacity</code> are some of the many words not recognized by IE8.</li>
<li>PressF12 to open up IE8&#8217;s Developer Tools.</li>

<p>For whatever reason, <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> is becoming my social media site of choice, probably because its humor appeals to me so much. I also love that it supports people easily creating blogs that cater to specific topics &mdash; like <a href="http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/">people of color in medieval art</a>, or <a href="http://moviecode.tumblr.com/">source code in TV and films</a>, or <a href="http://tabcloseddidntread.com/">intrusive pop-ups</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve made my own tumblr for gathering examples of <a href="http//delightful-ux.tumblr.com">delightful user experience</a>, which is my main interest when it comes to the wide world of human-centered design. Even though I love it, I&rsquo;m still muddy on what comprises a delightful user experience, and thus far have tossed in examples of <a href="http://adobe.breach.il.ly/#/about">useful websites with friendly wording</a>, as well as <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/post/71660750263/hells-pizza-coffin-box-new-zealand-based-hell">pizza box designs with unnecessary but awesome utility</A>, and <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/post/71681828062/australian-sharks-send-tweets-to-warn-swimmers">sharks with Twitter accounts</a>.</p>

<p>For now, when deciding whether to add an example, I ask myself, &ldquo;Could this Thing accomplish what it currently accomplishes, but in a more boring way?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Does this Thing solve for an action that is not-that-fun to do?&rdquo; And if the answer to either is &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; — lo, thusly do I deem it delightful.</p>

<p>I understand that second question might still catch Things that are not entirely playful — but I&rsquo;m not going to stress out about differentiating between design that&rsquo;s good and design that fulfills some nebulously defined good feel.</p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/10/24/phoenix-wright-dual-destinies-review-f8ea4d29/">via</a>)</p>


<p>After NaNoWriMo finished, my pastime of choice during my commute became playing through <em>Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies</em>.</p>

<p>[ spoilers ahead ]</p>

<p>Athena was a cool protagonist, though scenes where she was relegated to &ldquo;cyncial dude&rsquo;s naive, enthusiastic female sidekick&rdquo; were yawny. (Come on! Maya and Trucy are already these characters, we don&rsquo;t need more of them.) Ultimately it&rsquo;s nice to see that Athena has her own reasons for entering the attourneyforce, and though they were man-centered they were also totally platonic, which was nice. Athena&rsquo;s devoting to &ldquo;saving&rdquo; Blackquill also mirrored her desire to save her best friend, Juniper Woods, which meant her dramatic, heroic tendencies at least were in character.</p>

<p>Mostly I was happy to see old characters again, even Apollo Justice, who I disliked before but liked in <em>Dual Destinies</em>, probably because he was now a familiar face, haha. What I wanted most out of this game was to see Maya again, but I guess a note from her will do in lieu of <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>I also liked <em>Dual Destinies</em>&lsquo; execution of &ldquo;telling the end at the beginning.&rdquo; One of my favorite parts was realizing that Apollo had had an eyepatch over his eye even <em>before the courtroom explosion</em> — it was a fun/cute manipulation of the audience&rsquo;s assumptions that that particular bandage was just part of his injuries.</p>

<p>Good examples of &ldquo;the end at the beginning&rdquo; does <em>not</em>, however, include all the times that the game felt obliged to either tell you who the antagonist was, or make it clearly obvious, and PWDD&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&comic=123013">serious case of the hand-holdies</a>&rdquo; led to me to really only loving the game&rsquo;s final case, and feeling shruggy about the others. It would have been nice if each case had contributed more to each character&rsquo;s development as well; &ldquo;Ninetails Vale&rdquo; in particular didn&rsquo;t feel tied to anything in the larger story, and as a standalone wasn&rsquo;t terribly interesting to me either.</p>

<p>Documentaries are my whitenoise of choice. Due to studying, I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot more of them on Netflix.</p>

<p>More recently, I&rsquo;ve two documentaries about orcas: <em>Killer Whales</em> by the Discovery Channel, about the behavior of killer whales in the wild; and <em>Blackfish</em>, about orcas held in captivity. They&rsquo;re both pretty incredible; I&rsquo;m shocked at how much footage there is of killer whales doing things, whether it&rsquo;s hunting poisonous sting rays in New Zealand or yanking human beings into pools by their ankles.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hilarious to watch the footage of killer whales hunting seals in the first documentary, with a voiceover of a man marveling at their intelligence; and to watch this footage again in the second, where the background noise is preserved, and a woman is panicking, &ldquo;Oh no! Oh no! <em>On noooo</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Blackfish</em> also connected nicely with the last essay in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Science-Nature-Writing/dp/0547350635">The Best American Science and Nature Writing (2011)</a>, though the writer states there that one of the orca trainers was pulled by her hair into the water, whereas trainers in the <em>Blackfish</em> movie argue that this is a lie, another way to &ldquo;blame the victim&rdquo; of the orca attack, rather than the orca itself and the poor treatment that drove it to &ldquo;psychopathy.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://neauro.github.io/images/frozen-poster.jpg" alt="Frozen poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=109012">via</a>)</p>


<p>A and I went to see <em>Frozen</em>, a movie I had very little interest in seeing until I realized Idina Menzel was voicing a main character. There&rsquo;s been a lot said already for the lack of diversity amongst the characters (regarding both <a href="">race</a>, as well as <a href="http://sapphicdalliances.tumblr.com/post/68881922280">the representation of women</a>) and my disappointment about these issues in <em>Frozen</em> has exhausted me utterly. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it. Instead, I want to note aspects of the overall story that A and I discussed after the movie.</p>

<p>[ spoilers ahead ]</p>

<h2><em>Frozen</em> is about Elsa and Anna</h2>

<p>This is great. From the trailers, there was almost no indication that the story&rsquo;s main conflict involved the relationship between two women. Anna struggles somewhat with the men in the story, and though she desires &ldquo;true love&rdquo; at its beginning, lovers never usurp her existing relationship with her sister. At the end, Anna even plays the main role in saving both Elsa and herself, through the power of ~<em>True Love</em>~! Hurray!</p>

<h2>But what does <em>Frozen</em> do with &ldquo;True Love&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>&ldquo;True Love&rdquo; seems to be Frozen&rsquo;s main theme. Elsa&rsquo;s version of True Love is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t harm those who you love,&rdquo; and requires her to isolate herself as a precaution to harming her sister; the fact that doing so makes both her and Anna unhappy are not as important as Anna&rsquo;s safety. At the end of the movie, Elsa realizes (somewhat abruptly) that her version of True Love is flawed, presumably because it&rsquo;s more about fearing herself, rather than loving someone else. (…right? This actually happened so suddenly that I&rsquo;m just going to believe that this is the case.)</p>

<p>In contrast, Anna&rsquo;s version of true love — which could be described as &ldquo;Always believe in someone that you love&rdquo; — has absolutely no fear involved. Despite everyone&rsquo;s warnings and panic, Anna continues to believe the best of Elsa, even when Elsa actually <em>does</em> harm her.</p>

<p>I like how Elsa and Anna&rsquo;s interpretations of love clash in this movie, but one thing I don&rsquo;t like is that, though Elsa&rsquo;s view of love evolves by the end of the movie, Anna&rsquo;s view remains static. From the beginning Anna is the same &ldquo;open to loving people!&rdquo; character that she&rsquo;s shown to be from the beginning, despite events that show people can harm her: Elsa ostracizes her, Love Interest #1 (Hans) betrays her. That these events don&rsquo;t change her outlook on life feels like a waste; rather than actively choosing to love people, for Anna it&rsquo;s just a given, and this takes away from her complexity and agency as a character.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that the events of the movie are put into motion by Elsa&rsquo;s fear that she might kill Anna, and by the end of the movie, it&rsquo;s revealed that there was no way that Elsa could have ever killed Anna at all. The entire time, Anna had a magical understanding of &ldquo;True Love&rdquo; that could have <em>always</em> saved her from Elsa&rsquo;s power, which makes the entire plot somewhat of a non-issue.</p>

<h2>And what did the other characters do?</h2>

<p>Given that the movie&rsquo;s main conflict is Elsa and Anna&rsquo;s relationship, and true love, the other major characters — Kristoff, Olaf, and Hans — all felt thrown in. I would have loved to see them all focused to serve the &ldquo;true love&rdquo; theme by addressing love in different ways. Treated differently, Kristoff could have been a great catalyst for Anna&rsquo;s development of her version of love. I&rsquo;m inagining him, a character distrusting of other humans, teaching her about the horrible things humans do; she fights it (&ldquo;No way, humans are inherently Lawful Good!&rdquo;); Kristoff then points out that her sister is laying waste to their kingdom and also has been pretty mean in general to people; Anna cracks a bit; and then, right on cue, Anna is betrayed again by Hans.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://neauro.github.io/images/anna.jpg" alt="Frozen poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">omg will she now become totally jaded? or will she still choose looove? (<A href="http://turntherightcorner.com/2013/09/27/movie-trailer-for-disneys-frozen/disneys-frozen-2013-screenshot-princess-anna/">via</a>)</p>


<p>Kristoff&rsquo;s dislike of humans is played up without explanation of how it came to be, as if he had simply dropped out of the sky as a perfectly-formed gruff male love interest. I would have loved to see more time spent on him and his relationship with Sven and the snow trolls, rather than other seemingly extraneous details of his character. For example, why is it important that Kristoff is an ice merchant, and what was the point of the opening scene that is dedicated to showing his childlike failure at selling ice? You learn later that Kristoff was adopted by the trolls, and distrusts other humans; so if Kristoff was actually homeless at the beginning of the movie, why did he have a sled and ice-harvesting tools at his disposal? (Or was he not homeless? Are we just supposed to be okay with his abduction?) My headcanon involves Kristoff having saved Sven from the cruelties of humans in his life — meeting the trolls — realizing that they&rsquo;re way better.</p>

<p>Olaf was a character I grimaced at in the movie trailers and ended up being pleasantly entertained by.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://neauro.github.io/images/olaf.gif" alt="Frozen poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">oh youu (<A href="http://worldbuiltfor2.tumblr.com/post/69015715475/when-someone-emotionally-hurts-you-but-you-have-to">via</a>)</p>


<p>Even though his main purpose is comedic entertainment, it would have been nice to see more about what he means to Anna and Elsa&rsquo;s relationship. He&rsquo;s their precious childhood snowman, and is really the only indication Anna has that Elsa still treasures her after years of being isolated.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://neauro.github.io/images/olaf.jpg" alt="Frozen poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">love again, anna! do iiit! (<A href="http://www.rotoscopers.com/2013/09/27/ten-things-we-loved-about-the-new-frozen-trailer/">via</a>)</p>


<p>As for the last major-ish character, Hans: I wasn&rsquo;t too interested in him, and wish that all the time devoted to him was given to the other characters instead. Hans is too flat, an antagonist that comes out of nowhere, affects no one uniquely, and isn&rsquo;t redeemed. Anna could have been betrayed by any other person; Kristoff could have found any other, more character-specific reason to back off from being with Anna.</p>

<h2>In conclusion</h2>

<p>I had a lot of fun watching <em>Frozen</em>, particularly with the ~<em>twist</em>~ of Anna saving herself. And her kiss at the end with Kristoff was such consensual wow! Also, the particle effects were great.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Fire, Kristin Cashore]]></title>
    <link href="http://neauro.github.io/blog/2013/12/16/fire/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://neauro.github.io/images/cover_fire.jpg" alt="Fire cover"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6137154-fire?from_search=true">via</a>)</p>




<blockquote><p>It is not a peaceful time in the Dells. The young King Nash clings to his throne while rebel lords in the north and south build armies to unseat him. The mountains and forests are filled with spies and thieves and lawless men.</p>

<p>This is where Fire lives. With a wild, irresistible appearance and hair the color of flame, Fire is the last remaining human monster. Equally hated and adored, she had the unique ability to control minds, but she guards her power, unwilling to steal the secrets of innocent people. Especially when she has so many of her own.</p>

<p>Then Prince Brigan comes to bring her to King City, The royal family needs her help to uncover the plot against the king. Far away from home, Fire begins to realize there&#8217;s more to her power than she ever dreamed. Her power could save the kingdom.</p>

<p>If only she weren&#8217;t afraid of becoming the monster her father was.</p></blockquote>


<p>[spoilers below]</p>

<p><em>Fire</em> was alright. I liked the strangeness of monsters and their many colors; I liked all the politics, the twist that Fire had killed her own father and the general confusion of royal bloodlines. As in <em><a href="http://neauro.github.io/blog/2013-12-16-graceling/"/>Graceling</a></em>, the non-drama of sexual relationships is a relief. While reading, I hated Archer for being a posessive male character that we are meant to sympathize with; but thinking back, I don&rsquo;t think that his possessive behavior was ever excused by the story&hellip;except, I guess, for Fire&rsquo;s musing about how her innate monster beauty may have compelled Archer to become as horribly possessive as he was. This is uncomfortable because of its similarity to modern &ldquo;victim-blaming&rdquo; narratives, even if <em>Fire</em> explores Fire&rsquo;s strange ability to compel all humans when they look at her, not just men. It&rsquo;s also nice to see a romance not totally typical of YA: a non-virgin woman who falls in love with a man who already has a child.</p>

<p>One downside is that the voice of Fire herself doesn&rsquo;t differ too much from Katsa&rsquo;s in <em>Graceling</em>. Fire feels like a parallel universe Katsa, whose story ultimately isn&rsquo;t as interesting. One of the main reasons I was so attracted to the <em>Graceling</em> was — well — the Graces — and since the Dell doesn&rsquo;t have them, and since Katsa&rsquo;s world doesn&rsquo;t have monsters, this book feels like it&rsquo;s set in an entirely different universe. There&rsquo;s none of the excitement of familiarity, the fun of adding to the breadth and meaning of <em>Graceling</em>&rsquo;s world. The one connection between <em>Graceling</em> and <em>Fire</em> is Leck, but we barely know him from the first book, and I&rsquo;m not interested in any mysteries about how he came to be, since by the end of <em>Graceling</em> he&rsquo;s already dead. Leck&rsquo;s descent into sadism in <em>Fire</em> isn&rsquo;t particularly complex, either; he is shown to be a sociopath from the very beginning, and all interactions that he has with Fire feel tacked on and separate from Fire&rsquo;s own character growth. Had there been more of a commonality with <em>Graceling</em>, <em>Fire</em> would have been more of a hit with me.</p>

<blockquote><p>Katsa has been able to kill a man with her bare hands since she was eight - she&#8217;s a Graceling, one of the rare people in her land born with an extreme skill. As niece of the king, she should be able to live a life of privilege, but Graced as she is with killing, she is forced to work as the king&#8217;s thug.</p>

<p>When she first meets Prince Po, Graced with combat skills, Katsa has no hint of how her life is about to change.</p>

<p>She never expects to become Po&#8217;s friend.</p>

<p>She never expects to learn a new truth about her own Grace - or about a terrible secret that lies hidden far away&#8230;</p></blockquote>


<p>[spoilers below]</p>

<p>I finished <em>Graceling</em> and its companions in less than a week. I liked them — I liked the fairytale-ish turn of phrases (&ldquo;she had one eye blue and one eye green&rdquo;), the strangeness and OPness of Graces, the nondrama of sexual relationships. In <em>Graceling</em>, I can see how Katsa comes to like Po, and how her attraction to him is unique to her and her situation — being unable to trust that she wouldn&rsquo;t hurt anyone, he gives her a situation in which she can finally be herself.</p>

<p>The pacing was a little strange. One chapter near the beginning is devoted to exposition about the world, and is incredibly difficult to read through: there are so many new names to remember, so much information that gets in the way of the action I wanted to return to. The ending of the story drops suddenly as well: after Katsa primes the pirates to be ready for Leck&rsquo;s possible attack, it turns out Leck has already arrived at her supposed safehaven. Some of the motivations were tough for me to understand as well. How did Katsa and Po know so abruptly that Bitterblue was to be protected, at the cost of their own life? If Katsa was so adamant about not having children, why did she feel so strongly protective of Bitterblue? (I understand that you can not want to have children, and still like them; but there wasn&rsquo;t much other evidence for why Katsa would take to Bitterblue so strongly, especially given the distance with which she seemed to hold other acquaintances.) Why was Po ashamed of being blind? In fact, what was the purpose of those chapters at the end where the main Leck-related conflict has already been resolved, and all that&rsquo;s left is to angst about Po&rsquo;s blindness?</p>

<p>Overall <em>Graceling</em> was an entertaining read, and all the more fun because Katsa&rsquo;s &ldquo;true&rdquo; Grace was hinted at pretty well and it was fun to figure out for yourself what her talent actually was. I&rsquo;m also a fan of how she worked out what sort of relationship that she wanted with Po in the end, though, like with Brave, I felt a little dissonance with what she perceived marriage to be. It&rsquo;s strange to read fantasy and sit tight for explanations of multiple kingdoms and magic powers — and yet never be told why there are such conservative constructions of marriage, and why they have remained unchallenged. The limitations that we have in Real Life — patriarchy, religious morals — aren&rsquo;t elaborated on in <em>Graceling</em> and some other fantasy novels. It&rsquo;s strange to read books where misogyny exists because that&rsquo;s &ldquo;just the the way it is,&rdquo; even if characters challenge it later.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After eight years using Blogger, I&rsquo;ve finally decided to move away. One of the first reasons I first started using it in high school was because Blogger was one of the only free hosting services I knew where I could also control the styling; but after several Blogger updates, and several years of telling myself I&rsquo;d eventually learn Blogger syntax well enough to style as I like, I&rsquo;ve given up. I have other things I&rsquo;d rather do than invest time parsing Blogger, and Octopres offers more built-in tools <em>and</em> flexibility: I can have <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/code/">nice code snippets</a> and have whatever extra scripts I&rsquo;d like without worrying they&rsquo;d interfere with Blogger esoterica. Additionally, after reading <a href="https://medium.com/p/c7cc156bc5d9">this article</a> I&rsquo;ve been a little more wary of data ownership, and with Octopress, I can host on Github where I know everything is mine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been eyeing <a href="https://ghost.org/">ghost</a> recently and though it looks awesome, I decided against it for now for several reasons. Currently, there&rsquo;s no easy way to import posts from Blogger, and I didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the extra overhead of figuring out where to host. A couple days ago I received access to Ghost&rsquo;s subscription hosting, but I don&rsquo;t want to commit to paying money when this blog is mostly for lolzy purposes.</p>

<p>So, this is how I got my blog set up again:</p>

<h2>Get Octopress Up and Running</h2>


<p>To actually figure out how to get Octopress running, I referenced several tutorials:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">Octopress: Blogging Basics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/applications/getting-started-with-octopress/">Webdesign Tuts+: Getting started with Octopress</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/22/goodbye-blogger-hello-octopress/">iAlja&#8217;s Blog: Goodbye Blogger, Hello Octopress!</a></li>
</ol>




<h2>Convert Old Blogger Posts to Be Octopress-Readable</h2>


<p>
From one of the previous links, I learned how to convert all my old posts to a form Octopress could work with. To do it, open up your old blog in blogger, then go to <code>Settings &gt; Other &gt; Export</code> to download your blog as an XML file. Then, I used <a href="https://gist.github.com/juniorz/1564581">this script</a> to run the conversion.</p>

<p>I ran into some issues here, mostly with titles that contained quotation marks or tags that contained colons; whenever this happened I went through the XML and just removed the symbols that were causing things to explode.</p>

<h2>Deploy to Github Pages</h2>


<p>Finally, I followed <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">these instructions</a> to deploy my blog for free to Github Pages. I still ran into some problems here — when I deployed, the online version of the blog on Github lacked all styles and scripts — this requried a change to the <code>root</code> in config.yml to be <code>/liwanag</code>, since on Github the blog is acccessed through the URL <a href="http://neauro.github.io/liwanag.">http://neauro.github.io/liwanag.</a> Making this change to root upsets the styles and scripts linking locally, though&hellip;so I&rsquo;ve still got to iron this out and find the magical tweaks that will allow one root value to work both locally and online. There&rsquo;s also the matter that my blog is big enough that running &ldquo;rake generate&rdquo; takes a minute or so to run&hellip;but I&rsquo;m willing to accept that for now.</p>

<h2>That&#8217;s it!</h2>


<p>As one final change, I&rsquo;ve changed the name of this blog. Previously, it was &ldquo;nuubu&rdquo; — a romanization of &ldquo;noob&rdquo; spelled in Japanese, chosen offhandedly because I originally intended this blog to be my corner for new things I&rsquo;ve learned. Because &ldquo;nuubu&rdquo; may be appropriative, and because I don&rsquo;t feel particularly strongly about clinging to the identity of &ldquo;noob&rdquo; anyway, I&rsquo;ve now named it &ldquo;liwanag,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;light&rdquo; in Tagalog. To be honest, I couldn&rsquo;t really think of another name at the time, and &ldquo;liwanag&rdquo; just sounds nice and makes me think of how blog-writing (that is, writing for an unknwon audience, or &ldquo;bringing things to light&rdquo;) helps me think more clearly.</p>

<p><a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com">nuubu</a> remains active, because many of the images linked to here point to where they&rsquo;ve been uploaded on Blogger, and because I don&rsquo;t want to lose what little bit of popularity those posts have accumulated (specifically, the Rosetta Stone error, and Alpacasso). But overall I&rsquo;m excited and happy for this bright new world. ✧ʕ̢̣̣̣̣̩̩̩̩·͡˔·ོɁ̡̣̣̣̣̩̩̩̩✧</p>

    <id>http://neauro.github.io/blog/2013/11/19/allegiant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well! It&rsquo;s over.</p>

<p>I download <em>Allegiant</em> from the Seattle Public Library&rsquo;s eBook collection as soon as it became available, and read it over the course of a couple days, despite the looming presence of NaNoWriMo (which I&rsquo;ve been keeping track of in <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/nnwm2013">my Tumblr</a>).</p>

<p>[spoilers ahead]</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t have much to say about it. The writing wasn&rsquo;t that interesting. There are a smattering of issues that other reviews have already discussed — such as how Tris and Four&rsquo;s voices were barely distinguishable from each other, something especially tough to deal with when reading on a Kindle. In some places <em>Allegiant</em> felt repetitive. Tris was repeatedly described as either &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;pale,&rdquo; and it felt like eyes carried many of the discussions in this book. (Though I admit I&rsquo;m not overly fond in the first place of eyes described as communicating incredibly detailed emotions.)</p>

<blockquote>Now she looks pale and small, but her eyes make me think of wide-open skies that I have never actually seen, only dreamed of.</blockquote>




<blockquote>There is a wavering expression in her eyes, like she is a heap of leaves about to be scattered by the wind.</blockquote>




<blockquote>He has kept his eyes averted since I sat in the chair and they cut the strip of plastic binding my wrists together. For just for a moment, his eyes touch mine, and I know it’s time to start lying.</blockquote>




<blockquote>Her fingers are on his throat, taking his pulse, and her eyes are wide and empty. […] Her dark eyes are wide with fear as she says, “Are you hurt?”</blockquote>




<blockquote>She looks up at me, her eyes clear and eager.</blockquote>




<blockquote>She smiles, but her eyes are glassy, like a dormant part of her is fighting its way out and spilling over.</blockquote>


<p>I wasn&rsquo;t too interested in the big reveal of genetic tampering. Because it was just barely related to any events or concepts introduced in earlier books, it felt totally out of the blue. I could force a connection if I tried hard enough — maybe all the genetic stuff plays into the significance in earlier books about how &ldquo;one choice can define you&rdquo; —  but ultimately the genetic experiments felt unpleasantly disconnected and abrupt. Reveals are exciting and fun when you anticipate them, when you look back and realize that all the signs pointed toward them; not when they just slap you in the face under the guise of being totally mind-blowing.</p>

<p>I was also disappointed that two of the more obvious characters of color — Tori Wu, and Uriah — were killed off. Uriah&rsquo;s death acted solely as a catalyst for more of Four&rsquo;s angst, which he had enough of already, between worrying about his parents and worrying about his genetic purity. Tori&rsquo;s death accomplished nothing but the sorrow of a secondary character I hardly knew. Their deaths felt like a lazy way to get a rise out of the reader by taking away characters that had always been &ldquo;good people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the way that I feel about Tris&rsquo;s death as well. Her final reason for sacrificing herself wasn&rsquo;t related to anything else that she desired so desperately in the book: for her community to not die, for her to be with Four. I do like the twist in her character — how she first chose Dauntless, and then, in the end, chose again to be selfless Abegnation — but because I didn&rsquo;t see how it fit into an overall theme for the third book, this too felt like a cheap way to get me to have emotions about what was going on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried a couple times now to explain more about why the ending of Allegiant was so disappointing to me, but I&rsquo;ve found <a href="http://myallegiantreview.blogspot.com/2013/11/breaking-down-ending-to-allegiant.html">this blog post</a> that has already done all of the (super comprehensive) work.</p>

<p>The fact that this ending has, for many readers, &ldquo;ruined the entire series&rdquo; also reminds me of <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_kahneman_the_riddle_of_experience_vs_memory.html">this TED Talk</a>, in which the speaker talks about how the end of an experience can ruin the entire thing.</p>

<blockquote>But now there is another question: &#8220;How much did these patients think they suffered?&#8221; And here is a surprise. The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B. The stories of the colonoscopies were different, and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great &#8211; but one of them is this distinct &#8230; (Laughter) but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end; it&#8217;s a bad story. How do we know that? Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy, and much later, too, &#8220;How bad was the whole thing, in total?&#8221; And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.</blockquote>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZKxZeym4hI/UnhNh5LTGHI/AAAAAAAAER8/ijPCNF5uWhM/s1600/pokemonxy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZKxZeym4hI/UnhNh5LTGHI/AAAAAAAAER8/ijPCNF5uWhM/s640/pokemonxy.jpg" width="510" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshots of the websites for Pokemon X &amp; Y<br />Japan (above), Netherlands (bottom)</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">A couple weeks ago we analyzed the marketing sites for Pokemon X and Y across different countries. It turns out that all sites for Pokemon X and Y are the same — except for the one in Japan, which is shown at the top of the screenshot above.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The differences between the Japanese site and the rest-of-the-world sites include:</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1"><br /></div><h4>Feature Descriptions</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites contain more information about the game, for example, direct links to features like the Pokemon Global Link; on the Japanese site, these are internal.</div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Hype</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites feature a large image carousel on their homepage, which shows other features of the game, all shown to excite:&nbsp;<i>Discover the Might of Mega-Evolved Pokemon! A New World of Amazing Pokemon!</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div>In contrast, the front page of the Japanese site merely says:&nbsp;<i>Pokemon, heading to a brand new dimension</i>! (Referring, I think, to the 3D?)</div></div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Obvious Marketing</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites contain immediate links to buy the game, as well as the 3DS; the Japanese site does not. (According to Julius, the 2DS isn&#8217;t even available in Japan, perhaps because &#8220;Everyone there already has a 3DS!&#8221;)</div></div><div><h4><br /></h4><h4>JavaScript</h4><div>The Japanese site has very little Javascript, and each page looks to be straight HTML. Additionally, text is often baked straight into the images, rather than being left as straight text, which is often the case in websites due to accessibility issues. (Text on images cannot be easily parsed by screenreaders. Some users also prefer to render text on websites to be more readable, for example, through the excellent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.beelinereader.com/">BeeLine</a>&nbsp;app.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Description vs. Instruction</h4><div>The Japanese site is more descriptive of the story and characters of the game; the non-Japanese site is more instructive of how to play the Pokemon game.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="p1">We chalked up the majority of the differences the fact that Pokemon is more popular in Japan; Japanese game-players may not need to be particularly taught about Pokemon, or persuaded to buy it. But, this exercise makes me more interested in other facets of Japanese web design. Why is there so much baked-in text, why aren&#8217;t there fancy hover menu states, why is the design so flat compared to the chrome and bevels of the non-Japanese sites? Is web accessibility less important in the Japanese corner of the internet, or is it handled in a way that&#8217;s different in the US?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">One final note: out class lecture that week was done by Kate Edwards, current Executive Director of IGDA, who shared some cool stories regarding the &#8220;culturization&#8221; problems she&#8217;s encountered when helping to ship games across international borders. Something she noted was that, in the Netherlands, &#8220;adult&#8221; games don&#8217;t need to be localized into Dutch because the adults there prefer to play the games in English. So, the fact that the Pokemon X and Y site text is all written in Dutch…</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><br /><div class="p1">…well…you can totally still enjoy the world of Kalos as a grown-up grad student with a full-time job. Just saying!</div></div>

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth&#8230;and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.</blockquote><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">I saw <i>Gravity </i>with A last week. It was alright. People warn that the movie will cultivate in you a brand-new fear of nothingness but I have to say that what terrified me the most was the crescendo of the soundtrack, thickening and filling me with anxiousness before anything had even happened. The death of Goerge Clooney&#8217;s Matt also seemed to me to be unreasonably tragic, especially given the fact that he could have been <a href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/386990527406563329">easily rescued</a>.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I would have liked Matt&#8217;s sacrifice to be foreshadowed more clearly; the reasons for his final no-nonsense altruism were unclear. Did he sacrifice himself out of a sense of duty? Out of logic? Out of love for Ryan? The story poses life as utterly valuable — worth proceeding with, despite internal struggles and pain — yet allows Matt to give up his existence so easily. I don&#8217;t understand how he came to decide Ryan&#8217;s life was valuable. I don&#8217;t even understand how Ryan herself decided this about her own life at the end, laughing and monologuing and screaming as she fell back to the earth.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I&#8217;m biased, maybe — why someone would want to cling to life in the immensity of space is something I was anticipating this movie would explore. Since my personal contemplation of space eventually lends itself to existential panic and dismay that my life is so small compared to a millennia of life and death and nothingness,&nbsp;I wanted to see how this movie would handle it, to see how many mad hyperventilating spirals it would take to get down to hell and come out the other side. I wanted to know what it was people were really missing out there in space, and what was it that kept pulling them back to Earth.</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">(&#8230;.eh? <i>Ehhhh?</i>)</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2">On a completely different note, the morning before I watched <i>Gravity </i>was the morning I started reading about the Kessler syndrome in <i>Best American Nature and Science Writing 2011</i>…what a weirdly exciting coincidence. I wanted to stand up in the theater. &#8220;Guys! GUYS&#8230;IT&#8217;S THE KESSLER SYNDROME!&#8221;</div></div>

As someone on Reddit stated, one great thing about it is that the director does not underestimate the intelligence of his audience.

(Will the victims ever be okay again? What does &#8220;okay&#8221; even look like anymore?) <i>Upstream Color </i>requires an intellectual athleticism that leaves you a little sore by the end, in a way that&#8217;s not unpleasant.</div></div>

One hundred and eighty voices - male and female, young and old, from all walks of life and all over the country - talk intimately to the reader. Combining great humor and pathos this remarkable selection of stories from the thousands submitted to NPR&#8217;s Weekend <i>All Things Considered</i> National Story Project gives the reader a glimpse of America&#8217;s soul in all its diversity.</blockquote><br /><div class="p1"><i>I Thought My Father was God </i>is a compilation of short stories submitted by listeners to NPR&#8217;s National Story Project, and is fantastic. The events of each story are poignant in their mundanity; the fact that some of these stories were carried throughout the years and then threaded into words gives them a special impact, even if the events themselves are ordinary.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I was the third to be passed this book, after S and A, who read it over the course of several weeks. They found the stories too emotionally heavy to read more than a handful at a time; I found them too delicious to restrain myself. Each story is a good example of how small moments in someone&#8217;s life can resonate through years, through actions, through all parts of you; each one reminds me of the impact my own actions can make, however small, and reminds me the the lives of people around me are larger than the glances we exchange as we pass by on the sidewalk.</div><br /><div class="p1">My favorite story is <i>Iceman of Market Street</i>, especially given recent discussions about <a href="http://grist.org/cities/the-dark-side-of-startup-city/">the dark side of San Francisco&#8217;s transformations</a>.</div></div>

But she can&#8217;t outrun her past or her destiny for long.<br /><br />The Darkling has emerged from the Shadow Fold with a terrifying new power and a dangerous plan that will test the very boundaries of the natural world. With the help of a notorious privateer, Alina returns to the country she abandoned, determined to fight the forces gathering against Ravka. But as her power grows, Alina slips deeper into the Darkling&#8217;s game of forbidden magic, and farther away from Mal. Somehow, she will have to choose between her country, her power, and the love she always thought would guide her&#8211;or risk losing everything to the oncoming storm.</em></blockquote><br /><div class="p1"><i>Siege and Storm </i>is the second book in The Grisha Trilogy, and I picked it up because <i><a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/12/shadow-and-bone-leigh-bardugo.html">Shadow and Bone</a> </i>was alright, and I like finishing what I start. <i>Siege, </i>unfortunately, felt much messier than <i>Shadow — </i>details and characters were everywhere — they didn&#8217;t seem to stick to their identities, and sometimes did things or were capable of things I didn&#8217;t understand. Why does Alina, on page 200, suddenly cite an &#8220;inner cartographer&#8221; when cartography doesn&#8217;t affect anything but her description of a single room? How do Mal&#8217;s tracking skills lead to him being able to track what should have been a mythical creature, in an environment he&#8217;s presumably never been in before? Why is he capable of such observance that he can track animals, but can&#8217;t parse Alina&#8217;s secrets, despite being her childhood friend? Why does Genya stay with the Darkling in the beginning, instead of fleeing?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Speaking of Genya, when she re-appears later in the story, mutilated, what is it supposed to accomplish? It isn&#8217;t to show that the Darkling is evil — we already know that — he&#8217;s murdered people and blinded his own mother. Did the Darkling torture Genya for fun? Did he do it because Genya tried to fight him or escape? Did he do it just to bother Alina? The treatment of Genya in particular sickens me, because it accomplishes nothing significant story-wise, and is violent. It reeks of <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Women_in_refrigerators">fridging</a> (even though Alina, the protagonist, is female), especially since it was hinted that Genya was sexually assaulted in the first book.</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">Genya is a flat character; she exists in <i>Siege</i>&nbsp;to be beautiful and then to be &#8220;ruined&#8221; for no given reason, so harshly that Alina finally develops into someone ruthless. Alina snaps not when she learns thousands have lost their lives to the Darkling and his actions, and not when she learns Ravka&#8217;s monarchy is incompetent at best and cruel at worst — she snaps when she learns that there are peasants who call Genya &#8220;The Ruined.&#8221; Alina thereafter orders repeat offenders to have their tongues cut out.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Maybe the reason why Genya is Alina&#8217;s breaking point is because the Darkling&#8217;s actions are finally personal to Alina now, but even so, I don&#8217;t feel that I have enough of a grasp on Alina&#8217;s motivations and feelings to understand how Genya in particular affected her. Throughout the book Alina cites her desire to save her country, to prevent unnecessary deaths; but the deaths of anonymous villagers and even of almost all of the Grisha don&#8217;t move her the same way Genya&#8217;s mutilation does. Alina&#8217;s overall motivations through the book feel hand-waved. Why does she want to save Ravka? Just Because? What has it ever done for her?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The world-building felt especially messy. Both the sea whip and the firebird are creatures that are supposedly famous and well-told in Ravkan stories, but we never hear these stories being told. It&#8217;s tough to feel that either are so notorious or venerable without evidence, though I would have really enjoyed reading about them if they had been alluded to more in the first book. I&#8217;m also still not clear on what exactly &#8220;sun summoning&#8221; is, and since there&#8217;s a lot made of how Ravka&#8217;s canon magic &#8220;only messes with what exists, and doesn&#8217;t create anything new from nothing&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure how Alina can just summon light out of nowhere in the first place.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I&#8217;m also not a fan of the Russian (Russian-esque?) words thrown into the book at various places. I&#8217;m not sure what they&#8217;re supposed to accomplish. A sense of exoticism? Why are some words italicized and some not, like &#8220;Etherealki&#8221; versus &#8221;<i>grenatki,</i>&#8221; or &#8220;samovar&#8221; versus &#8221;<i>kvas</i>&#8221;? The flavor is too inconsistent — and for me, too meaningless — to enjoy.</div><br /><div class="p2">Though I still didn&#8217;t find many reasons to like Mal, I <i>really </i>enjoyed reading about<i>&nbsp;Siege</i>&#8217;s&nbsp;newest character, Nikolai, to extent that I wished that the entire book was about him instead, haha. Nikolai, a rebellious privateer prince who desperately cares for others and deeply understands human nature, is way more compelling than another naturally handsome teenage peasant whose biggest problem is his commoner&#8217;s bloodline. Bardugo&#8217;s dialogue in general also has Whedon-esque punchyquipness and I loved reading it.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2">For the third book: I&#8217;m excited to see what reasons the Darkling had to commit all the atrocities he did. I really am! I also hoped Nikolai survived. <i>Please. Think of the quips!</i></div></div>

And weirdness! And mysteriousness!</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Spoilers ahead.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>1.</h2></div><div class="p1">One of my favorite parts of adventure games is the characterization that rises through interaction with items. Do characters like a certain item, or dislike it? Does the item bring up deep heartbroken memories of the past? How do they parse and react, and what does their rumination say for who they are? I&#8217;m reminded of Nancy Drew&#8217;s endearing enthusiasm for lifting up random objects (&#8220;This plastic DNA model will be useful!&#8221;) and Phoenix Wright&#8217;s skeptical amusement when things like puppies are added to his inventory.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The most interesting item in the game for me was the toy cat, which I enjoyed petting all the time to accrue invisible &#8220;sanity&#8221; points. Engaging with the cat toy in particular puts you in the shoes and brain of the lone survivor himself, tinkering with a plush at the end of the world, just to have something light-hearted to do.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>2.</h2></div><div class="p1">Speaking of the cat plush, I loved the detail of this game — the unidentifiable flesh-like substances stretching across the wall — the way your map was dark unless you viewed it under sources of light — the specific food items like Delicious Ham, the creepy bottomless repositories of pills and Rotten Meats.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>3.</h2></div><div class="p1">A criticism of <i>Lone Survivor</i> seems to be that it was not scary enough. I played it at the height of summer and even then it was plenty terrifying, even if most of my stress and fear stemmed from being unable to hoard my bullets as obsessively as I would have liked.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Another scary part: putting your hand in that horrifying pink-red flesh-pixel hole. I <i>really </i>did not want to do that.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>4.</h2></div><div class="p1">The dream sequences were cool, and the characters therein intriguingly surreal, which I loved. Ultimately, however, I didn&#8217;t feel that these scenes contributed to a larger understanding of what was going on, which was disappointing. Rather than deep, the first ending I received was vague, and a letdown. After carrying and caring for this dude I&#8217;d wanted a little more than a whiff of a broken heart. I wanted to know more about what this girl meant to the protagonist, how her departure left his life with zombie-filled corridors.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>5.</h2></div><div class="p1">I got my ending by playing as paragon as possible. I wanted to see if other endings would give me closure, so I found them on Youtube. Each one seemed vaguer than the last, and didn&#8217;t interest me that much. I don&#8217;t have a particular love of multiple endings and for me it&#8217;s because they lack impact: I&#8217;ve only rarely encountered any set that comfortably resolves all issues and tension introduced in the game, and the way that such endings are reached never quite seems to match the decisions you made to get there.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">In the case of <i>Lone Survivor, </i>the decisions that you make add to an invisible calculator which eventually spits out one of these endings: for example, killing more monsters gives you endings that imply you&#8217;re mentally unstable. But why? What is it about killing these things makes you this way? The worst ending can also be achieved not just by killing monsters, but &#8220;eating food when not hungry or hurt&#8221; and &#8220;sleeping for no reason&#8221; (per <a href="http://lonesurvivor.wikia.com/wiki/Endings">this wiki</a>). What&#8217;s <i>that </i>connection?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>6.</h2></div><div class="p1">This was my other favorite part: getting that white cat to come live with me. I guess it&#8217;s strange to be saying that after my demands for meaningfulness, since other than the invisible points, hanging out with the cat doesn&#8217;t reveal any more of the protagonist&#8217;s inner story. But playing with the cat, I felt for the first time that I was doing something in the game that I personally wanted, like it was really <i>me</i> in there, and not me poking through things in a dude-shaped glove.<br /><br />Come here! Come <i>here</i>, little digital thing!<br /><br /></div><div class="p1"><i>come and be with me forever</i><br /><i><br /></i><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tvhPIy5tDo/UilDcBOQcrI/AAAAAAAAEBc/f6aLd4GxHlk/s1600/Sunny.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tvhPIy5tDo/UilDcBOQcrI/AAAAAAAAEBc/f6aLd4GxHlk/s1600/Sunny.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://lonesurvivor.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><i><br /></i></div></div>

I loved <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/10/bastion-logtistical-est.html">Bastion</a> and I&#8217;m super super super excited for <i>Transistor</i>, because it has a female protagonist with curly hair. <i>Curly hair!</i><br /><br />(Or at the very least, <i>wavy hair!</i>)<br /><br />I was not keen on attending PAX this year until I found a friend selling tickets and my compulsion to hoard scarce resources broke through my skepticism of the event. I first went in 2009 and stopped out of boredom and <a href="http://debacle.tumblr.com/">discomfort</a>, but decided I&#8217;d give this year another try, not because I think trivializing rape is okay (I <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/genesis-2.html">don&#8217;t</a>) but because I wanted to see if the environment has changed since <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2013/06/full-ign-interview-with-anita-sarkeesian/">Tropes Vs Women</a>. I also really, really, <i>really</i> wanted to see <i>Transistor</i>.<br /><br />Since I got my tickets late, I started cosplay work only about a month before PAX started, which also happened to be right in the swing of summer quarter. Making the sword was fun and challenging, mostly because it was my first time working with plastic. First I made some sketches and then a model using some leftover foam from my <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2013/04/sakura-con-2013-cosplay-black-rock.html">Strength cosplay</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uP3HTT7dTS4/Uif_sQSC7DI/AAAAAAAAD-s/487Li4QQ4lc/s1600/sketch.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="482" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uP3HTT7dTS4/Uif_sQSC7DI/AAAAAAAAD-s/487Li4QQ4lc/s640/sketch.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">such cosplay wow</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then I visited <a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/">TAP Plastics</a> and after beating around the bush I admitted that I was making a giant sword. Turns out the guy staffing was also a cosplayer and happy to give me advice, which I desperately needed. I had my heart set on a blue-y transparent plastic, which they didn&#8217;t have, but he explained that if I painted on the backside of clear plastic, <em>it would look like a mirror</em>…and that sounded great! I got a couple samples of green-edge acrylic and tried out a couple different paint colors on it.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lo5wfmiMpD4/Uif_5u8R3wI/AAAAAAAAD-0/S4caFilJwac/s1600/paint+test.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="290" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lo5wfmiMpD4/Uif_5u8R3wI/AAAAAAAAD-0/S4caFilJwac/s640/paint+test.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i was so bright-eyed then</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A pointed out that what would really make the sword striking would be a strong contrast between the base color and &#8220;solder lines,&#8221; so for the base color I decided on using a lot of green to really make the inner lines stand out.<br /><br />Then I visited TAP Plastics to get the pieces cut, and at the last moment decided I wanted not just half an inch thickness of plastic, but a whole inch. Imagine my shock and horror when I realized that such a width of plastic is actually heavy. Like, <em>really</em> heavy. (I don&#8217;t have a scale, but a friend&#8217;s estimate when he picked up the final product and grimaced was 35 lbs, so I&#8217;m going with that number.)<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8SxFDzB53F0/UigAxKgvILI/AAAAAAAAD-8/e-Q0WPJRfeA/s1600/heavy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="531" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8SxFDzB53F0/UigAxKgvILI/AAAAAAAAD-8/e-Q0WPJRfeA/s640/heavy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">heavy, but still not as unwieldy as strength arms</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My plan was to do a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_glass_painting">reverse painting</a> deal on both sides of the sword and then sandwich them together.

I realized that in my limited time I wouldn&#8217;t be able to do anything three-dimensional for that border, so I decided to just paint another blue circle.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kei6SIadyXw/UigHA-lNSkI/AAAAAAAAD_o/yicAVzmckIU/s1600/circle.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="489" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kei6SIadyXw/UigHA-lNSkI/AAAAAAAAD_o/yicAVzmckIU/s640/circle.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dry dry dry!

Because the plastic turned out to be so heavy, and because we were pressed for time, we left the handle rectangular, rather than shaved down to the canon cylinder.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AOFidkP7444/UigIgs5iDyI/AAAAAAAAEAI/U6O5SE2-dQ0/s1600/DSC_0275.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AOFidkP7444/UigIgs5iDyI/AAAAAAAAEAI/U6O5SE2-dQ0/s640/DSC_0275.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">plywood fins</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After that, with his father&#8217;s help, A and I clamped the two pieces together in a vise and drilled holes through the wood and plastic! Again not canon, but the pieces were <em>such heavy wow, </em>and needed that extra reinforcement.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ36fytFm70/UigJlaSW8uI/AAAAAAAAEAU/4XrID4GWUV4/s1600/drill+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ36fytFm70/UigJlaSW8uI/AAAAAAAAEAU/4XrID4GWUV4/s640/drill+montage.jpg" width="508" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so close!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After drilling, we had planned to take the sword apart and touch up the paint a bit, but…after all the clamping, the two pieces of plastic ended up <em>completely stuck together</em>. So much for worrying about it coming apart.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lFnXTGExgtY/UigJylAc8dI/AAAAAAAAEAc/CemsLFy3qgo/s1600/plywood.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lFnXTGExgtY/UigJylAc8dI/AAAAAAAAEAc/CemsLFy3qgo/s640/plywood.jpg" width="424" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the light does cool shading tricks through the plastic</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The last thing to be built was the pommel, which A flashed out overnight. I have no pictures of it, but it was made out of some plastic canisters and a plastic soysauce dish hot-glued together and painted over. Cosplay at its finest. :&#8217;)<br /><br />Finally, what was left was to paint the plywood pieces, and then glue on the red eye. A also put on some electrical tape to make the side fins appear more indented, but the tape near-immediately fell off during peace-bonding. Ah well!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2tCzKsrHSt8/UigKzHyNehI/AAAAAAAAEAk/mjFAjlJXg7g/s1600/finalish+montage+copy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="456" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2tCzKsrHSt8/UigKzHyNehI/AAAAAAAAEAk/mjFAjlJXg7g/s640/finalish+montage+copy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">done!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />As for the dress itself…I reused the racer-back tank pattern I made for the Strength cosplay, though I made it longer and added a kind of cape for the sleeves. I wanted to sew the jacket as well but ran out of time and ended up compromising by sewing a satin triangle to a long black jacket I found at a consignment store a couple days before PAX. The last thing I did was the feather collar, which I made by sewing feathers into leftover Strength felt and sewing it around the dress&#8217;s neck.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v5pXoNDFlwg/UigLYHBNKzI/AAAAAAAAEAs/YCIBxAQnyKw/s1600/DSC_0293.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v5pXoNDFlwg/UigLYHBNKzI/AAAAAAAAEAs/YCIBxAQnyKw/s640/DSC_0293.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">feathers!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />On the day before PAX I also quicked out the triangular ring from Sculpey (also left over from Strength cosplay; thank goodness I can reuse so much stuff) and acrylic paint.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TsVv3uZLfkA/UigL1ImNGlI/AAAAAAAAEA0/6du08qR3d88/s1600/IMG_6350+copy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TsVv3uZLfkA/UigL1ImNGlI/AAAAAAAAEA0/6du08qR3d88/s640/IMG_6350+copy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">photo by <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Sooo overall…though there are a couple things I want to re-do for the next round (including remaking the feather collar and ring), I finished a new cosplay and am proud of my new forays into the world of plastic! PAX itself was fun in and of itself; I was really happy to finally play Transistor, and even more excited for it once I actually played and recognized all the programming nods. I was a little bewildered by the inclusion of the &#8220;stop time and attack&#8221; thing, until I realized it was <em>so thematic</em> — since the Transistor&#8217;s atacks are sort of like methods, &#8220;stopping time&#8221; to queue up attacks and execute them really mirrors compiling programs. <i>Uwaaa.</i><br /><br />I was also surprised and happy to see so many cool Reds at PAX, many of whom had taken the extra leap to use ~*electricity*~! I briefly ran into the Red from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Breakers-Cosplay/419407924815813">Breakers Cosplay</a> who was super impressive and inspiring. I also met a lot of progressive dudes and women who specifically talked about how awesome it is to have A Female Protagonist in a game (something I don&#8217;t think I would have <em>never</em> heard anyone say flat-out in years past), and a lot of friendly people in general who gamely attempted holding my Transistor and remarked at how they admired my ridiculousness for carrying it around all day at the convention, haha. To be fair, my arms were really sore afterward, but all my rock climbing callouses helped out quite a bit!<br /><br />My favorite moment in all of PAX was to meet Jen Zee, who was so awesome and kind and asked for pictures in which I tried desperately to look cool despite my euphoria. She also gave me a ton of Supergiant swag that I placed all around my house immediately. :&#8217;)<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uIlReuprg1U/UigMVP6jKFI/AAAAAAAAEA8/kw8k9oCPExI/s1600/DSC_0306.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uIlReuprg1U/UigMVP6jKFI/AAAAAAAAEA8/kw8k9oCPExI/s1600/DSC_0306.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i christen thee, supergiant wall</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There was also a magical instant where A and I, passing curiously by the Paramount, suddenly realized that Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett were performing and dashed inside as quickly as possible and caught <i>the Transistor song</i>!<br /><br />All this being said, I had a great weekend, mostly due to the friends and people I was able to meet. I don&#8217;t think I feel comfortable enough to return again (because <a href="http://shoshanakessock.com/2013/09/04/pax-youve-gone-and-done-it-an-open-letter/">reasons</a>), but I am thankful for my personal experience this year.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CWR-fH-wYac/UigQ5IFyy7I/AAAAAAAAEBI/GzPz6mXRg3s/s1600/1240322_10151588009897060_1663051843_n_1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="534" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CWR-fH-wYac/UigQ5IFyy7I/AAAAAAAAEBI/GzPz6mXRg3s/s640/1240322_10151588009897060_1663051843_n_1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">especially for time runnin around with <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a>!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And finally, now that both my summer quarter classes and PAX are completely finished, I am free!<br /><br />…and ready to devote myself to a new project! Maybe something for the <a href="http://towerjam.tumblr.com/post/59682821300/welcome-to-tower-jam">Tower Jam</a>?</div>

Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by giants. Giants are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source.

<div class="p1">I&#8217;m unenthusiastic when it comes to designing websites for small screens like phones, probably because I don&#8217;t have a smartphone. (No particular reason why — just that my 6-year-old palm-sized brick of a phone is sturdy and unexciting to steal, and I plan on staying with it as long as it stays with me.)</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a>&nbsp;is what I&#8217;ve been learning recently; it is a &#8220;mobile framework&#8221; and &#8220;HTML5-based user interface system,&#8221; which means that you can</div><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1">stick it in your project</li><li class="li1">throw in some common &#8220;mobile&#8221; UI elements like headers and buttons, or even switches</li><li class="li1">have those buttons be styled to look pretty good already!</li></ul><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Function-wise, you can also use jQuery Mobile to</div><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><a href="http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/pages/page-transitions.html">transition very prettily between pages and dialog boxes</a></li><li class="li1">easily support <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4176844/can-someone-explain-the-html5-aria-attribute">ARIA attributes</a>&nbsp;for better accessibility across your UI elements</li></ul><br />jQuery mobile was confusing for me at first because I would write simple markup, but when viewing it online, my bare elements would suddenly have tons upon tons of classes — a div with a class of <code>mobile-header</code>, for example, would suddenly be a div with the classes <code>mobile-header ui-header ui-bar-a</code>, and would also have a <code>data-role="header"</code> as well. Links in my <code>mobile-header</code> would have also been transformed into elements with tons of classes: <code>icon ui-btn-left ui-btn ui-btn-up-a ui-shadow ui-btn-corner-all</code>…<br /><br /><div class="p1">Which brings me to my next point about jQuery Mobile: it is a <i>pain</i> to style into your theme. Because elements can be so deeply nested, it&#8217;s hard to figure out what exactly is making all of my links black when they should be blue, and so on. Trying to make a link blue may require that you overwrite not just one style but two. jQuery provides a <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/index.php">theme roller</a>&nbsp;which you can use to change the default black style downloaded in the package, but as the things I want to make are radically different than the rounded, chrome buttons they offer, a theme roller doesn&#8217;t help much.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Regarding getting started, I found that <a href="http://thehungrycoder.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/jquery-mobile-part-1-making-your-first-mobile-page.html">this blog post</a>&nbsp;and the ones following were quite helpful. Additionally, this link on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bryanrieger/rethinking-the-mobile-web-by-yiibu">Rethinking the mobile web</a>&nbsp;is a great primer on why developing for the mobile web is important (despite all my eye-rolling/teeth-gnashing) and gives data and another perspective on &#8220;mobile-first&#8221; design processes.</div></div>
