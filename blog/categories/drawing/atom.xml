    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
At Fugazo, I was hired initially to design a hidden object game. I've made a couple of posts about&nbsp;<a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search?q=hidden+object">this type of game</a>, but never talked about mine, which was going to be a fantastical version a la <a href="http://www.boomzap.com/">Boomzap</a>'s <i>Awakening</i> series, which would hopefully shine in a market saturated with grimy amusement parks and children being stolen and dangled off cliff-ledges by evil wizards.<br /><br />The premise of the story was that a village had had its special crown stolen by a thief, who wanted it for a queen in a distant land, who in turn wanted it so she could look cool at parties. The crown was a symbol of the ancient pact the village had with the elements, and upon its disappearance havoc arose: cookfires burst, water slid away from mouths and flasks, the air blew cold, stones rolled across the feet of weary villagers, etc.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YtmP55ls_xA/UAN1Xkcy1CI/AAAAAAAABqs/WjAqz6RtxtQ/s1600/elements+map+3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="481" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YtmP55ls_xA/UAN1Xkcy1CI/AAAAAAAABqs/WjAqz6RtxtQ/s640/elements+map+3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a sketch of the world map;<br />the big part is the temple, the bottom-left part the village</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The elemental avatars were housed in a temple with four quarters on some massive landmass overlooking the village. Wanting to set things straight, the villagers send a girl to temple to make peace, and she ventures bravely despite the fact that avatars are known to turn annoying trespassers into statues or sparrows or whatever else pleases them. Upon arriving at the temple, the girl runs into a talking hawk, who aids her in her quest with dry banter and the occasional vague StarCraft reference. ("You need more crystals! ...to finish this mini-game")<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c-L6g8ERer0/UAOpUQ1fCiI/AAAAAAAABsE/PW2TzcL9s_s/s1600/elements+dragon.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c-L6g8ERer0/UAOpUQ1fCiI/AAAAAAAABsE/PW2TzcL9s_s/s640/elements+dragon.jpg" width="584" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the avatar of the fire temple, a kind of fuzzy dragoness</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In the end, it turns out that the hawk has been the thief all along; he had been turned into a hawk as punishment for getting lost and rummaging around the sacred temple. At the conclusion of the game, an epic match-three-kinda mini-game ensues in which the girl/you defeat him and win the crown back.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time playing other games for ideas on mini-games, and prototyping them out on paper, and testing them against coworkers.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1ZQsf6z184g/UAN4jKVzGbI/AAAAAAAABrA/t4dbVRs3tpA/s1600/c1d4510e072011e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1ZQsf6z184g/UAN4jKVzGbI/AAAAAAAABrA/t4dbVRs3tpA/s320/c1d4510e072011e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a photo of a paper prototype inspired by UW's <a href="http://games.cs.washington.edu/Refraction/refraction.html">Refraction</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also spent a non-negligible amount of time outlining the various areas of the temple in a composition notebook, which I filled to the margins with cheap ballpoint ink (as it is a favorite tool of mine, beside Steadler mechanical pencils).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6xHGGSMHnWE/UAN395Irb3I/AAAAAAAABq4/oLIc7ojXnkc/s1600/elements+earth+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="408" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6xHGGSMHnWE/UAN395Irb3I/AAAAAAAABq4/oLIc7ojXnkc/s640/elements+earth+temple.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(page 1/2) a scan of my sketchbook with various areas drawn out for the "earth temple"</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l9XshfoY4Tk/UAOq_xYyZBI/AAAAAAAABsM/CE3zetuT_Hs/s1600/elements+forest.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="415" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l9XshfoY4Tk/UAOq_xYyZBI/AAAAAAAABsM/CE3zetuT_Hs/s640/elements+forest.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(page 2/2) a scan of my sketchbook with various areas drawn out for the "earth temple" </td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also laid out certain rooms and angles for detail and fun.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--x7SzByFqJ8/UAN50iElStI/AAAAAAAABrI/l2aJAKT3C-M/s1600/elements+fire+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="185" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--x7SzByFqJ8/UAN50iElStI/AAAAAAAABrI/l2aJAKT3C-M/s320/elements+fire+temple.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketch of the fire temple's "tea room"</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B4vx2Xcbrws/UAN53Woe0FI/AAAAAAAABrQ/OHHMFzZI2Mg/s1600/elements+water+throne.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="184" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B4vx2Xcbrws/UAN53Woe0FI/AAAAAAAABrQ/OHHMFzZI2Mg/s320/elements+water+throne.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketch of the water temple's "throne room"</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c5z8VivuyT0/UAN5_IwrX6I/AAAAAAAABrY/I4cvgSpziUk/s1600/elements+fire+overhead.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c5z8VivuyT0/UAN5_IwrX6I/AAAAAAAABrY/I4cvgSpziUk/s640/elements+fire+overhead.jpg" width="434" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketch of the fire temple</td></tr></tbody></table><br />One unfortunate thing is that I don't have much in-game art to show. Since the art made from these sketches is "really" the work of my team's artists, I'm not comfortable sharing it. What mini-games were implemented aren't something that can be easily shared either, as are the environments and dialogue that I scripted out using our in-game scene editor...so, bummer.<br /><br />Why was the project canceled? Mainly because our small team (one designer, one programmer, and roughly four artists) couldn't compete with much larger teams working on the market. Art style is at the forefront of the hidden object genre, with many players turning away if something is too dark or too colorful, and we didn't have the power to create, polish, and re-polish within a reasonable timeframe, especially with the paint-y style that we wanted to move forward with. &nbsp;There was also greater interest with pursuing more "game-y" games, hidden objects being fairly linear.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mPTPHA4aTQo/UAOokIYbyJI/AAAAAAAABr8/bTRj-F6cECw/s1600/elements+air+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="408" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mPTPHA4aTQo/UAOokIYbyJI/AAAAAAAABr8/bTRj-F6cECw/s640/elements+air+temple.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketches of the air temple, which (spoilers) was going to be on the back of a bird<br />that blue is a plastic tape-bookmarker-thing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Perhaps some elements of...Elements...will be recycled for future projects.</div>

Not so hard, as Charlie had already implemented the store-type setup, and I really just needed to change a couple variables here and there and add the right checks to make sure the avatars loaded properly.  The hardest thing was testing each little avatar and making sure that the frames were all separated -- if the images on the frames are too close together, then you can see bits of them leaking onto other frames of an animation.  There's probably a smarter way to figure out where the delineation is in Flixel sprite animations, but I haven't been able to find it yet.<br /><br />Hopefully this will make our Facebook release even just a little bit more fun/appealing.  FB release will happen at the latest this Thursday, if another team-member hasn't already pushed it.  Player.IO was apparently pretty easy to hook up to Facebook if you subscribe to Sitebox, which is a relief; I'm planning to get more details later on how exactly Charlie did it.</div>

Awesome, they are so cute! I forgot that you draw also. Maybe I&#39;ll have to get you to do the art on one of my games sometime. :)</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FS01GyXZtMU/TdtOqq5GybI/AAAAAAAAAOM/KqG4OmKmecU/s1600/kongregate_users.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="197" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FS01GyXZtMU/TdtOqq5GybI/AAAAAAAAAOM/KqG4OmKmecU/s320/kongregate_users.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the first 200-some players of our silly capstone game</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It's been about 24 hours since <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/getAcross/get-across">our first online release of Get Across</a>.  Our capstone class recommends moving from Newgrounds, to Kongregate, but then to Facebook, but it's taken us such a long time to learn Player.IO that we skipped straight to Kongregate, as <a href="http://playerio.com/documentation/quickconnect/kongregate">Player.IO already supports this.</a>.<br /><br />Still, our release was (to me) a little rushed, and I would have loved nothing better than to clutch the game even tighter and keep anyone from seeing it at all.  We have presentations on Tuesday on what our first round of releasing reveals to us about the game, and I haven't parsed through the data that we've collected yet, but an onslaught of a mysterious error regarding null quest objects made me really self-conscious about what was going on.  <em>I don't want anyone to play a game that is still buggy.  Nononononono!</em><br /><br />It's hard to debug from Player.IO's error log, though it is very informative concerning what errors popped up, whether they were serverside or clientside, when they happened, and how often.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UwlYNphQNgA/TdtRshfzMqI/AAAAAAAAAOU/u3pc3S_SXdQ/s1600/playerio_errorlog.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="186" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UwlYNphQNgA/TdtRshfzMqI/AAAAAAAAAOU/u3pc3S_SXdQ/s320/playerio_errorlog.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">just look at those graphs, dude!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Some of the players on Kongregate have been really helpful in leaving comments about their thoughts and the bugs they've encountered; but there are about 6 of these comments, and 200+ registered players, most of whom didn't really make it through the tutorial levels.  I have a good guess why: <em>the tutorials take forever to load</em>.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I'm guessing it might be because we have a lot of objects in the database, and a lot of the properties of those objects are nested objects or arrays, which must take longer to retrieve.  Seeing as tutorial levels are pretty essential for hooking in initial players, I'm hoping to make it so that the tutorial levels are completely static and client-side -- no saving data into the database, nothing.  If a player comes back, they'll just have to start over.  Hopefully this will make it so that we only really save "real" player data in the database as well, and keep out the clutter.<br /><br />So even though I really wouldn't have wanted to release the game this soon, this little bit of playtesting illuminated something that we otherwise would have learned at the last awful minute, for the final Facebook release.  Which is nice.<br /><br />As a sidenote, the last push I made to Get Across before the release were updated character sprites for our classes, "Cook," "Crafter," and "Planter."  Charlie drew the first set, which were endearingly derpy --<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BpSQDmsoKDg/TdtS8xpShpI/AAAAAAAAAOc/xeVTMU2HQDw/s1600/old_classes.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="131" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BpSQDmsoKDg/TdtS8xpShpI/AAAAAAAAAOc/xeVTMU2HQDw/s320/old_classes.png" /></a></div><br />And these are the more recent ones --<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X1nWWgR4z_E/TdtTFRAwnII/AAAAAAAAAOk/QkC5Sdg-LI0/s1600/getacross_classes.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="131" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X1nWWgR4z_E/TdtTFRAwnII/AAAAAAAAAOk/QkC5Sdg-LI0/s320/getacross_classes.png" /></a></div><br />Hopefully more character customization will come soon, though it's hard to say what we'll have time for.  2 weeks left to polish up the back-end code and the mechanics!</div>
