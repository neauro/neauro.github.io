<p>After NaNoWriMo finished, my pastime of choice during my commute became playing through <em>Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies</em>.</p>

<p>[ spoilers ahead ]</p>

<p>Athena was a cool protagonist, though scenes where she was relegated to &ldquo;cyncial dude&rsquo;s naive, enthusiastic female sidekick&rdquo; were yawny. (Come on! Maya and Trucy are already these characters, we don&rsquo;t need more of them.) Ultimately it&rsquo;s nice to see that Athena has her own reasons for entering the attourneyforce, and though they were man-centered they were also totally platonic, which was nice. Athena&rsquo;s devoting to &ldquo;saving&rdquo; Blackquill also mirrored her desire to save her best friend, Juniper Woods, which meant her dramatic, heroic tendencies at least were in character.</p>

<p>Mostly I was happy to see old characters again, even Apollo Justice, who I disliked before but liked in <em>Dual Destinies</em>, probably because he was now a familiar face, haha. What I wanted most out of this game was to see Maya again, but I guess a note from her will do in lieu of <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>I also liked <em>Dual Destinies</em>&lsquo; execution of &ldquo;telling the end at the beginning.&rdquo; One of my favorite parts was realizing that Apollo had had an eyepatch over his eye even <em>before the courtroom explosion</em> â€” it was a fun/cute manipulation of the audience&rsquo;s assumptions that that particular bandage was just part of his injuries.</p>

<p>Good examples of &ldquo;the end at the beginning&rdquo; does <em>not</em>, however, include all the times that the game felt obliged to either tell you who the antagonist was, or make it clearly obvious, and PWDD&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&comic=123013">serious case of the hand-holdies</a>&rdquo; led to me to really only loving the game&rsquo;s final case, and feeling shruggy about the others. It would have been nice if each case had contributed more to each character&rsquo;s development as well; &ldquo;Ninetails Vale&rdquo; in particular didn&rsquo;t feel tied to anything in the larger story, and as a standalone wasn&rsquo;t terribly interesting to me either.</p>
