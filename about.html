<div class="about">
<h3>Hello!</h3>

<p>
I'm Nadine. I'm a designer experienced with owning UX design and UX research techniques to explore and bring ideas from early concept to finished, validated feature.</p>

<p>
I graduated from the University of Washington (B.S. Computer Science, M.S. Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering).
</p>

<p>
As a designer, I enjoy building things that are not just usable, but do good, are fun, and provide a service for people in everyday life.
</p>

<p>
I write sci-fi, fantasy, and horror and my writing has been a finalist for the Bram Stoker Award. I also take pictures, draw, play with my dog who decided she didnâ€™t wanna do shows with me anymore, and read a lot (recently, Strange Pictures by Uketsu and the entire Animorphs series).
