By that point, each unnamed ‘brat’ has trained into one of three groups–Breeders, Builders, or Hunters, identifiable by the number of scars they bear on their arms. Deuce has wanted to be a Huntress for as long as she can remember.<br /><br />As a Huntress, her purpose is clear—to brave the dangerous tunnels outside the enclave and bring back meat to feed the group while evading ferocious monsters known as Freaks. She’s worked toward this goal her whole life, and nothing’s going to stop her, not even a beautiful, brooding Hunter named Fade. When the mysterious boy becomes her partner, Deuce’s troubles are just beginning.<br /><br />When she and Fade discover that the neighboring enclave has been destroyed by Freaks, who seem to be growing more organized, the elders refuse to listen to their warnings and exile Deuce and Fade. As t he two are guided out of the dead city by Fade&#8217;s long-ago memories, they face dangers, and feelings, unlike any they&#8217;ve ever known.</em></blockquote><br />I had to admit that I read Enclave just for something simple and easy to gnaw at&nbsp;between textbooks. It contains (what is inexplicably) my favorite male character&nbsp;stereotype, The Dark Loner with Mysterious/Potentially Tortured Past. What can I&nbsp;say? Some people chill out with chocolate or a reality TV show; I do it with the&nbsp;darkest, most tormented love interest I can find.<br /><br />Enclave was at first satisfying as far as &#8220;chill out&#8221; reading goes, but halfway through pivots, sheds or destroys almost all of the character relationships and world that it constructed, and goes running off haphazardly in a completely new and bewildering direction. The book, which had started in the underground ruins of New York, expels Deuce and Fade to the sunlit &#8220;Topside&#8221; at the drop of a hat, due to a conspiracy which had never before been mentioned but which Deuce suddenly realizes has been exposing itself in the form of innocents exiled to the &#8220;Topside&#8221; every once in a while.<br /><br />Deuce&#8217;s two best friends since childhood betray her, throwing away pages of friendship-building for no conceivable reason. A resistance to the enclave&#8217;s evil leadership, newly uncovered and heated in the ominous death of a well-beloved character, becomes irrelevant.<br /><br />Once on Topside, which turns out to be Fade&#8217;s original home, Fade motivates their progression northward, following a dream of better land that I have no idea why he didn&#8217;t follow before he was led underground. Deuce at some point is captured by Topside gangers, and meets Tegan, &#8220;liberally covered in bruises&#8221; and obviously lacking status amidst &#8220;the males&#8221; around her:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>She left my hands tied. </i>Smart girl. Well, relatively.<i style="font-style: italic;"> </i><i style="font-style: italic;">She couldn&#8217;t be too </i><i>smart if she took those bruises without complaining, but as I knew, you could used to anything.</i></blockquote><br />Wait, huh? How do you know she&#8217;s not complaining? Is she not smart because she&#8217;s being <i>abused?</i><br /><i><br /></i> Later, Tegan admits,<br /><br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost two cubs in the last year. The last time, I almost died. That was when I decided, if I ever got a chance to run, I&#8217;d take it. So I bided my time.&#8221;</i></blockquote><br />Okay, so Teagan has been likely made to have sex and children against her will, likely taken in a raid for &#8220;Breeders&#8221; by Stalker. Do you feel sympathy now, Deuce?<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Stalker shrugged, as though [Teagan&#8217;s] opinion didn&#8217;t matter to him. I understood, I thought. He could respect Fade and me because we&#8217;d fought. Because she hadn&#8217;t, Tegan might never gain full value in his eyes.</i></blockquote><i><br /></i><i>No. I cannot even marginally respect that Deuce can &#8220;understand&#8221; why Tegan may not have &#8220;full value.&#8221;</i>&nbsp;Depicting a possible rape victim as a weakling who isn&#8217;t respected because she didn&#8217;t&nbsp;<em>fight until she died</em>&nbsp;is not okay, not even in a fictional universe, because no universe born from a mind raised in this one is free from the influences of a society where rape is still something people joke about, trivialize, and often blame on the survivor.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t think the problematic elements of this story could get any more ridiculous until the character that had held Tegan captive, the aforementioned Stalker, became a love interest. Though Tegan is considered to be a friend by Deuce, there&#8217;s still a sense that Stalker, the abuser, is more easily forgiven and respected than Tegan, the abused. How can this be even partially attractive?<br /><br />In the end, I can&#8217;t appreciate a book that takes heavy concepts like patriarchy and sexual abuse and, rather than examining them critically, only perpetuates them.</div>

Escape from slaver&nbsp;Darwin West and his cruel Overseers. Escape from the backbreaking work of&nbsp;gathering Water. Escape from living as if it is still 1812, the year they were&nbsp;all enslaved.<br /><br />When Ruby meets Ford—an irresistible, kind, forbidden new Overseer—she longs to&nbsp;run away with him to the modern world where she could live a normal teenage&nbsp;life. Escape with Ford would be so simple.<br /><br />But if Ruby leaves, her community is condemned to certain death. She, alone,&nbsp;possesses the secret ingredient that makes the Water so special — her blood —&nbsp;and it’s the one thing that the Congregation cannot live without.<br /><br />Drought is the haunting story of one community’s thirst for life, and the&nbsp;dangerous struggle of the only girl who can grant it.</em></blockquote><br />Drought was okay. Ultimately I felt the really compelling ideas in the story &#8211;&nbsp;the life-giving blood, the 200-year-old-plus members of the capital-C Congregation &#8211; were never&nbsp;given enough room to become really magical. Though she struggles with how to&nbsp;lead and sustain her community, the 200-year-old Ruby doesn&#8217;t act or think like&nbsp;anything other than a suppressed teenager from any other YA novel. Does 200 years&nbsp;mean so little?<br /><br />Ruby&#8217;s blood has the power to heal wounds and grant&nbsp;longevity&nbsp;to its drinkers,&nbsp;because she is the daughter of a man, Otto, who had the same. Ruby sneaks her blood into the Congregation&#8217;s life-giving Water, which she and her Congregation gather under the chain whips of Darwin West. No one knows that the only active ingredient in Water is Ruby&#8217;s blood. At some point in the past Otto left for some reason, and the Congregation&nbsp;and Ruby spend the entire novel praising and waiting for Otto to deliver&nbsp;them from their slavery. Spoilers: he does not. From whence did Otto come, to&nbsp;where did he go? Why does he have magical blood? Spoilers: you never learn.<br /><br />That you never learn who Otto is or why he and Ruby have magical blood feels unfair. The mystery and suspense of the entire book deflates anti-climatically with Ruby&nbsp;and Ford fleeing out to live their presumably superhuman-long lives&nbsp;together, since it&#8217;s hinted that Ford, engorged with Ruby-blooded Water, might&nbsp;just match Ruby lifespan-wise. Even this might have been satisfying if Ruby had&nbsp;spared some thought to the effect of &#8220;I don&#8217;t know who Otto is and I don&#8217;t care,&nbsp;because I am done hinging my life on a person who hasn&#8217;t existed in it since I&nbsp;was born 200 years ago.&#8221;<br /><br />Ruby and Ford&#8217;s romance was also a shrug for me, a love-at-first-sight that never grows into any deeper chemistry. They have a simple growing lust for one another, and Ford makes promises to Ruby that he&#8217;ll give her everything she wants, which at first iteration involves popcorn and warm spaghetti. Ford plays a blue-eyed teenager who pulls on an Overseer&#8217;s tormentor mask so as to earn health insurance for his mother, who is apparently dying of cancer. Can Ruby&#8217;s magical blood cure Ford&#8217;s mother? Spoilers: this isn&#8217;t something discussed in the novel, though I really wish it was. Imagine if the conflict in this book involved Ruby considering giving Ford her blood, torn between wanting to keep her healing blood a secret and wanting to help Ford, torn between wanting him happy and wanting him to stay even if his mother were well&#8230;something like this might have more tightly bound the themes of &#8220;healing blood&#8221; and &#8220;young/first love,&#8221; maybe, shrug.<br /><br />One thing that I really loved about this book were its antagonists, which at first numbered Darwin, head exploiter of the Congregation, whose whip comes out at the least provocation and results in the frequent bloody beating of Ruby&#8217;s mother. Darwin comes up with a variety of ways to torture the Congregation, each more frustrating to read about than the last. Ruby&#8217;s mother is the other antagonist, at first a supportive figure whose unending mantra to &#8221;<em>sustain</em>&#8221; the Congregation, rather than break free, becomes absolutely infuriating after a while (in a good, &#8220;This character is making me have feelings! Whoa, look at the conflict!&#8221; way).</div>

On the recommendation of my friend, I checked out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312362919/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312362919&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day</a>&nbsp;from the library and attempted its secrets.<br /><br />Having never made bread before and heard much of the difficulty of doing so, I was pretty skeptical. In the end it did not, in fact, take me five minutes, but forty or so minutes (from &#8220;cloaking&#8221; the bread to throwing it in the oven to eating it with delight) is not that bad.<br /><br />My first attempt was remarkably crusty and white and fluffy inside.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JNgwvcLgeaQ/UHIMz0kzc1I/AAAAAAAACoM/ROtgu_MxL98/s1600/goodbread.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JNgwvcLgeaQ/UHIMz0kzc1I/AAAAAAAACoM/ROtgu_MxL98/s640/goodbread.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">WHOA. did i really do that?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My second attempt was crusted with soot as black as midnight and filled the entire house with smoke besides.

Obedient, passionate, and committed to her country, she is being groomed for success in the Republics highest circles.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Born into the slums of the Republic&#8217;s Lake Sector, fifteen-year-old Day is the country&#8217;s most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths &#8211; until the day June&#8217;s brother, Metias, is murdered, and Day becomes the prime suspect. Now, caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family&#8217;s survival, while June tries desperately to avenge Metias&#8217;s death.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>But in a shocking turn of events, the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths to which their country will go to keep its secrets.</i></blockquote><br />I tore through this book like Oreo cheesecake (which is, not un-coincidentally, my favorite type of cheesecake, which is in turn my favorite type of cake). It contained all my favorite ingredients: dystopian surroundings (also known as a delicious yet crumbly crust), two main characters who are &#8220;specialists&#8221; at their game (the sugar),  who are additionally enemies of each other <em>and also love interests ahhhh</em> (the cheese).<br /><br />That being said, though I enjoyed reading it, there were things that could have been better. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any real purpose to why the Republic is in a dystopian/corrupt state, only some hand-waving about factions like &#8220;the Colonies&#8221; and the &#8220;Patriots,&#8221; all of whom struggle against one another for vague territorial reasons. The youth of the Republic are all forced to go through &#8220;Trials&#8221; to determine their future, but there&#8217;s no strong underlying reason <em>why</em>. Occasionally there are references to a mysterious pre-dystopian country regarded with awe &#8211; a flag comprised of thirteen red and white stripes with fifty dots on a blue rectangle, an ancient coin that reads <em>In God We Trust</em> &#8211; but that&#8217;s about it. Why are people fighting for this by-gone era? Why are they regarding old quarters as precious? I guess we&#8217;ll figure out in the next book?<br /><br />Another thing: one of the characters later is revealed to have a &#8220;dominant ethnicity&#8221; of &#8220;Mongolian,&#8221; but is still blonde-haired and blue-eyed, which is bewildering to say the least. I&#8217;m not saying that Asian people are never born without blonde hair or blue eyes, but given the context of this book in its genre and in our society, where Asian people are often absent or played by white people, this particular Mongolian character ends up feeling uncomfortably &#8220;exotic.&#8221;<br /><br />The book is told from the alternating first-person perspectives of &#8220;June&#8221; and &#8220;Day,&#8221; which was okay, though both characters are so similar that I&#8217;m not sure I would have been able to tell them apart if the font face and color hadn&#8217;t also alternated with each voice. A significant feature of both characters is their extreme attention to detail, which is fun, but also feels misused at times; there must have been at least three people which were noted as left-handed, not because left-handedness meant anything, but just to illustrate <em>again</em> how observative the main characters were, in case you&#8217;d forgotten. Aside from that, the story is easy to read, and filled with tasty drama.<br /><br />In conclusion: Legend is good cheesecake.</div>

I went with Selesnya because of course. Playstyle-wise (and flavor-wise), I resonate with it more.

Izzet and Golgari were the first sold out at the pre-release that I attended, though I was so sure people would be eating up <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=archon+of+the+triumvirate&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">the Azorius promo</a>. Selesnya and Rakdos were left for last, but after having the opportunity to play against all the guilds, Rakdos really seems to be the strongest in this format, to me, given that it can make use of <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=carnival+hellsteed&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Carnival Hellsteed</a> right off the bat (attacking as a&nbsp;<i>first strike 6/5 wat</i>), has many not-bad commons, and can even make use of Golgari&#8217;s scavenge creatures (imagine scavenging counters onto <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=270349">Daggerdrome Imp</a> or something&#8230;wah!)<br /><br />My decklist:<br /><br /><i>Creatures</i><br />2x Azorius Arrester<br />2x Centaur&#8217;s Herald<br />2x Centaur Healer<br />2x Gatecreeper Vine<br />1x Fencing Ace<br />1x Seller of Songbirds<br />1x Rubbleback Rhino<br /><i><br /></i><i>Spells/Artifacts</i><br />1x Street Spasm<br />1x Druid&#8217;s Deliverance<br />2x Trostani&#8217;s Judgment<br />1x Eyes in the Skies<br />1x Coursers&#8217; Accord<br />1x Call of the Conclave<br />1x Mana Bloom<br />1x Avenging Arrow<br />1x Explosive Impact<br />1x Sundering Growth<br />1x Seek the Horizon<br />1x Collective Blessing (mwahaha)<br />1x Izzet Keyrune<br /><br /><i>Land/Gates</i><br />5x Forest<br />4x Plains<br />1x Mountain<br />2x Selesnya Guildgate<br />2x Transguild Promenade<br />1x Izzet Guildgate<br />1x Grove of the Guardian<br /><i><br /></i>Populate is <i>so fun</i>. Out of all of the pre-release promos, <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=grove+of+the+guardian&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Grove of the Guardian</a> definitely felt like it was the one with the most synergy with its colors and keywords. The number of times I was able to pop and then populate an 8/8 token and was not insubstantial. And once I managed it, no one was able to bring it/them down, though one Golgari opponent kept fishing for his <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=abrupt+decay&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Abrupt Decay</a>, in vain. I&#8217;m glad that I decided to stick straight with a populate theme, though cracking a <a href="http://magiccards.info/rtr/en/183.html">Niv-Mizzet</a> in my first pack and an <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=epic+experiment&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Epic Experiment</a> in my second did make it so I was <i>really</i>&nbsp;tempted to splash both red and blue, which I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t.<br /><br />Something I missed was the keywords for RTR playing into some world story. Innistrad&#8217;s keywords (transforming, morbid, etc.) really spoke to the general atmosphere of the world and its creatures, as well as providing interesting play. I guess the &#8220;story&#8221; of RTR really may just involve guilds all fighting each other, but it would be nice if there was something a little more than that, which you can soak up without delving into pages of a wiki.<br /><br />I ended up going three and one, and drew a Trostani in one of my reward packs!

Ever since Leilani told me about them, I&#8217;ve been absolutely obsessed with doing <em>vermicompost</em>, aka getting a box, filling it with worms, and leaving my organic materials in there to rot and be eaten and transformed into ~*castings*~ after about six months.<br /><br />Step 1: Get the box. In this case, two Rubbermaid boxes into which were easily drilled rows and columns of holes. The holey one is meant for the worms; the one without the holes is meant to gather what I believe some people refer to as &#8220;worm tea.&#8221;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9kSBfcX8CpE/UGaJA8WN0hI/AAAAAAAACjM/vQv6hzFzpR0/s1600/DSC_0001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9kSBfcX8CpE/UGaJA8WN0hI/AAAAAAAACjM/vQv6hzFzpR0/s400/DSC_0001.jpg" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">break out that drill</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Step 2: Get and prepare the&nbsp;bedding&nbsp; Actually, I got the worms first before preparing the&nbsp;bedding&nbsp; which consisted of an issue of Real Change and some pages from The Stranger (torn haphazardly into one-inch, stripper-ad-covered strips), and a bunch of old peanut shells and bok choy ends from that night&#8217;s <a href="http://rasamalaysia.com/recipe-kung-pao-chicken/2/">dinner</a>. Because worms thrive in a wet environment, you&#8217;re supposed to <a href="http://organicgardening.about.com/od/compost/ss/setupawormbin_4.htm">soak the papers until they feel like a damp sponge</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7YUalRY0ACc/UGaJCEJFC9I/AAAAAAAACjk/qiCVGrlvrXg/s1600/worms.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7YUalRY0ACc/UGaJCEJFC9I/AAAAAAAACjk/qiCVGrlvrXg/s640/worms.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">worms and bedding</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Step 3: Once the beddings are prepared, put in the worms! We got these worms from <a href="http://www.stonewayhardware.com/">Stoneway Hardware</a>, which seemed to be one of the few places in Seattle that have them in supply. At first glance the canister seemed full of dirt, but after curiously (and then furiously) drumming out the clump of soil from the bottom of the canister, we stared in shock and not a little abrupt nausea at the wriggly, thrashing mass.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q4-AEPVyFg4/UGaJBkon9OI/AAAAAAAACjc/Cc0qV_eLn4E/s1600/wormbin.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q4-AEPVyFg4/UGaJBkon9OI/AAAAAAAACjc/Cc0qV_eLn4E/s640/wormbin.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">worms!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />They thrashed away from the light, some of them so vehemently that they fell down the drill holes and had to be rescued and placed back amidst the feast. We then covered the tub with a thin layer of <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/autumn-perennial-planting.html">compost</a> (having heard that compost can be full of helpful microbes) and placed it lovingly inside an empty cabinet for easy disposal of plant-based debris.<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard to say what really attracted me to vermicompost, but I guess it&#8217;s the idea that you&#8217;re <em>closing the circle</em> &#8211; putting some of your food to the creatures who will help you convert it into stuff to help more plant foods grow. I guess it doesn&#8217;t hurt that I really enjoy taking care of things in general, especially when &#8220;taking care of things&#8221; consists of placing a bok choy end in a cabinet every now and then.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CExg13WO2sg/UGaJBJdqisI/AAAAAAAACjU/31e28x48Grw/s1600/cabinet.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CExg13WO2sg/UGaJBJdqisI/AAAAAAAACjU/31e28x48Grw/s400/cabinet.jpg" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">thar be worms</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
This past week has been busy with moving, the start of my new job, and the start of autumn quarter, but at some point we finally found time to plant the starters that we (well, I) bought (starry-eyed) at various nurseries.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve spent the past couple weeks reading books to raise my gardening level a little higher  before attempting The Real Thing. Library discoveries include <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046HAJ9K/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0046HAJ9K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Talking Dirt</a></em> by Annie Spiegelman, and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1604692200/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1604692200&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Decoding Gardening Advice: The Science Behind the 100 Most Common Recommendations</a></em>, by Jeff Gillman and Meleah Maynard. Both are incredibly readable and filled with great beginner information, especially for someone like me, who scarce knew the difference compost and mulch. Yes, they are different! And they do different things! Whoa! Both books are also incredibly forgiving and advise constant questioning of advice and continued experimentation and learning. So&#8230;here we go!<br /><br />Now knowing that &#8220;compost&#8221; is something which can be added to the dirt of places to make it all-around better for plant growth, we purchased some large bags and amended the beds around the back of the house, which (though covered appealing rich brown mulch) proved to be mostly rocky, pale dirt. Thereafter we planted some packets of seeds that seem to be ready to plant at about this time: overwintering carrots, swiss chard, spinach, cilantro. I am wary of seeds, especially since we just planted them straight in rather than growing them indoors beneath a light or something first, but I guess we&#8217;ll see what happens with these.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_6POawL7UHs/UGaD1ijHJQI/AAAAAAAACh0/aF87yH46bF8/s1600/dirt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_6POawL7UHs/UGaD1ijHJQI/AAAAAAAACh0/aF87yH46bF8/s640/dirt.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dat compost</td></tr></tbody></table><br />We also transplanted <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/things-ive-learned-about-my-new.html">that blueberry bush</a>, which had &#8211; since the time I bought it &#8211; started exhibiting an alarming amount of yellowing leaves, as well as leaves that curled at their edges and became a pale brick-red color that was soft to the touch. Maybe scorch? Maybe a fungus? Maybe a canker? Maybe the effect of general nutrients or acidity leaking from its black gallon pot? In any case, we transplanted it into a corner of the beds with some scoops of azalea/rhododendron fertilizer to make up for any acidity the soil may not have, since I was a bad gardener and haven&#8217;t checked the pH yet&#8230;I was too nervous of leaving it to wilt further in that container.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCFJTyJfdXA/UGaD0vaYXQI/AAAAAAAAChk/UPMkWr-QYvY/s1600/blueberry.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCFJTyJfdXA/UGaD0vaYXQI/AAAAAAAAChk/UPMkWr-QYvY/s640/blueberry.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sorry, blueberry plant :(</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It&#8217;s had some new young leaves since this last photo, which hopefully grew not just because of the burst of nitrogen in the fertilizer, which apparently can cause new growth that then just dies in winter because it isn&#8217;t strong enough to withstand the cold. (Which is why fertilizers should be applied in spring, I suppose. Then again, another part of one of these books says it&#8217;s best to plant perennials in autumn, when hot weather isn&#8217;t there to stress them into not forming good roots&#8230;ahh!)<br /><br />One thing learned from these books is that, when buying perennials, it&#8217;s better to choose a small, unblooming candidate. Small plants are better able to withstand transplanting, and if they don&#8217;t yet have blooms, they can focus more of their energy on growing strong roots. It&#8217;s also important to make sure that plants aren&#8217;t&nbsp;root-bound,&nbsp;which can be checked by tipping the plant out of its pot and making sure the roots are white, not encircling the pot, and not smelly.<br /><br />Anyway, one of the new starters we got was a lemon balm.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-saSzMt32Ewk/UGaD2mNrhpI/AAAAAAAACiE/xUQsOrmTFUM/s1600/lemonbalm.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-saSzMt32Ewk/UGaD2mNrhpI/AAAAAAAACiE/xUQsOrmTFUM/s640/lemonbalm.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small; text-align: start;">lovely smelly smell</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Lemonbalm is part of the mint family, and is fragrant as all hell. You only need to touch the stems or leaves to have your hands come away with an inexplicably lemony and lovely aroma. It&#8217;s apparently quite easy to take care of (even to the point of growing flush with more pruning?). For now it&#8217;s by the front door so that we can grope it every time we leave.<br /><br />Beside it is a rosemary because of course.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FttRcXtdwa8/UGaD3WJ-MKI/AAAAAAAACiM/qvViGHxF1Gs/s1600/rosemary.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FttRcXtdwa8/UGaD3WJ-MKI/AAAAAAAACiM/qvViGHxF1Gs/s640/rosemary.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">like duh</td></tr></tbody></table><br />They&#8217;re hardy enough that they grow on sidewalks here, tempting passersby to take a sprig despite the likelihood of such a sidewalk denizen having been&nbsp;anointed&nbsp;with pesticides or (worse) dog pee. In any case, rosemary always struck me as an uncomplaining garden occupant with the advantage of yielding omelette-friendly seasoning.<br /><br />Beside <em>that</em> is a stout chocolate mint, which some years ago I had tried to grow on a windowsill, to no avail. These seem a bit more sturdy than my previous twig of a chocolate mint, so here&#8217;s hoping the mint family is as vigorous as people complain about, and can withstand my less-than-masterful attempts to support its survival.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C0zBJTfrP38/UGaD1BZFGbI/AAAAAAAAChs/xrVn2y7n1bM/s1600/chocomint.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C0zBJTfrP38/UGaD1BZFGbI/AAAAAAAAChs/xrVn2y7n1bM/s640/chocomint.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">good luck, little one</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The last plant we planted in was an agatasche, or &#8220;hummingbird mint,&#8221; which can possibly attract hummingbirds, if they indeed exist here.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6qsoAsvB9eQ/UGaD0G7GYwI/AAAAAAAAChc/WHtiv-L-F-k/s1600/agastache.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6qsoAsvB9eQ/UGaD0G7GYwI/AAAAAAAAChc/WHtiv-L-F-k/s640/agastache.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i think i saw one here once?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In general it was an attractive enough plant that I decided to forego my want of only edible gardening plants to obtain it. Presently it&#8217;s planted in the bed around the monkey-tail tree, which makes me a little nervous since one of the things these books said was, <em>Don&#8217;t raise a garden around the trunk of the tree!</em> This can apparently smother the roots there, and can lead to a greater chance of diseases or fungi attacking the tree. I believe that this garden was placed around the tree to make the house look pretty before we moved in, but Andou doesn&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s large enough to really harm the tree. I hope so, because the tree is so large and beautiful that it would be a shame if it died&#8230;<br /><br />So, yeah, anyway, to be honest I didn&#8217;t really check the rootbounded-ness of any of these perennials, nor am I entirely sure, having already planted them, whether they were overly-rootbound or not&#8230;but as of this morning they were still alive, so, that&#8217;s good.<br /><br />While digging up the front beds to place in new plants, we ended up unearthing some mysterious bulbs which look a lot like garlic but may not be. Planted here by previous tenants perhaps? Some of them were sadly crushed, but I&#8217;ll re-plant them once the earth cools down a little and I&#8217;m ready to plant some tulips I received as a gift.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi_JALLdVAI/UGaD2Bn8rCI/AAAAAAAACh8/7rwT0jBdT6E/s1600/garlic.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi_JALLdVAI/UGaD2Bn8rCI/AAAAAAAACh8/7rwT0jBdT6E/s640/garlic.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">we&#8217;ll see what occurs later</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></div>

Compared to Tumblr, it&#8217;s something that fell short of my &#8221;<a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/09/habit-zone.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NirAndFar+%28Nir+and+Far+Blog%29">habit zone</a>,&#8221; maybe because I felt less of a community there, or because the cascading photos serve so much better the action of basking in the beauty of something for three seconds before moving onto the next Amazing Thing That I Want to Try (like <i><a href="http://www.17apart.com/2012/02/how-to-grow-green-onions-indefinitely.html">growing green onions indefinitely</a>, WHOA</i>. Though, apparently the onions only last about 3 or 4 more chops, and get pretty bland). Compare to Tumblr, where the single-column feed of media encourages you to stay, and to read, and to discuss, at least a <i>little</i>&nbsp;longer.<br /><br />Something that Pinterest has about Tumblr is the sense of organization &#8211; my storage of links on Tumblr just gets larger and longer and harder to parse, especially with the overhead of adding tags (which may not match tags I already made, and which I might not have added at all, out of laziness). In contrast, organization in the form of boards is Pinterest&#8217;s foundation, and it also very easily keeps tracks of images and their source links for you. It&#8217;s also easy to skim even huge piles for what you want, or easy to just skim them with a smug sense of satisfaction at your gathered knowledge.<br /><br />Pinterest! The best way to visually organize cross-platform bookmarks in a way that makes you feel as productive as if you had actually been doing all the DIY things you&#8217;re marking to do Later.</div>
