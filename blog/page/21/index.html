This morning Kelly and Chris and I grabbed breakfast at Boogaloo&#8217;s in Valencia (which is delicious&#8230;and oh man, have I not actually eaten since then?!  It&#8217;s filling too!).  Then Kelly showed us his monome in his apartment, and I discovered his stash of Arpakasso.  I ask if I could take them away for pictures before he redistributes them to his sisters, he says yes, I frolic away and spend the rest of the day taking endearing shots.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6068256474/in/set-72157627364814073" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bIx2iqImLwM/TlHzdtelJpI/AAAAAAAAAXE/kb100UP2s-Y/s640/6068256474_27149e500d.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />One thing that I love about Arpakasso is the personality of each Arpakasso&#8217;s face.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
A couple nights ago I attended the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/gamesjs/events/27773901/#initialized">GamesJS Kickoff Meeting</a>, at which were speakers discussing the advantages of game development in HTML5 and JavaScript.  It was held at IGN.  The place turned out to be filled with a lot of indie game devs, and a lot of the advantages toted were that of the cross-platformability of games built using HTML5 and JavaScript, which can go on phones and computers without any worries of Flash compatibility.  Plus, for any indie game dev, to choose only one platform for your baby heavily limits its potential audience.<br /><br />I have to admit now that the only thing I know about HTML5 is that it has a &lt;canvas&gt; tag.  I know JavaScript, but not to its very fibers.  I was mainly going as a deep-dive, and man, there were so many technologies that I have never heard before, and am bookmarking here for later investigation:<br /><br /><strong>crafty.js</strong><br /><a href="http://craftyjs.com/">crafty.js</a> is the Flixel of JavaScript.  Collision detection!  Sprite maps!  Woo!<br /><br /><strong>jsFiddle</strong><br />The presentation for crafty.js had a lot of this <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a> stuff, which I guess is like a JavaScript console, which is super cool.  I talked to Kelly about it excitedly and he was like, &#8220;Yeah.  It&#8217;s pretty neat.  <span class="shh">I guess.</span>&#8221; lol kelly whatever<br /><br /><strong>Spaceport</strong><br /><a href="http://sibblingz.com/">Spaceport</a> is another game engine which aids cross-platform support from web to iOS.  Write your JavaScript and translate it to ActionScript like instantly!  It has super good performance and will be in public beta sometime in September.  You can purchase a license or, if you are a poor game dev, you can use Spaceport through a revshare model.<br /><br /><strong>V8</strong><br />During the Spaceport presentation, talk about something called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> suddenly happened.  It turns out that <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/v8/intro.html">V8</a> is Google&#8217;s &#8220;open source, high performance JavaScript engine…written in C++ and used in Google Chrome.&#8221;<br /><br /><strong>Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</strong><br />The last speaker was a woman from Google who spoke briefly about <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a>, which is a &#8220;Java software development framework&#8221; which allows you to build user interfaces, have client-server communication, etc.  You can deploy applications you make to the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.<br /><br /><strong>PlayN</strong><br />I couldn&#8217;t actually find a link for this yet, but PlayN is relevant to games on Google+.<br /><br /><br />There is just SO MUCH technology in the world.  People didn&#8217;t really talk to each other during the meetup (then again, I came late and perhaps wasn&#8217;t trying hard enough to ~*network*~ with everyone), but still, being in a place like this really makes me feel inspired to learn more about everything.<br /><br />Afterward, Kelly, Jonah and I walked through downtown talking about all the places we&#8217;ve been and the bros we had and went to Bi-Rite Creamery.  I tried the Dainty Gentleman, which is a concoction of: 2 scoops of honey lavender ice cream, with drizzles of hot fudge and blood orange olive oil, sprinkled with seasalt.  You would not believe the amazing flavors that comes out of this combination.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
For whatever reason, adding a model to a database in Rails took me forever to understand.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kellydunn">Kelly</a>, I now have model-making in Rails down to an art.<br /><br />Want to add a new table or a new column to your Rails application?  This is what you do!<br /><br /><br /><h3>1. Create a new .rb file for your model</h3>Let&#8217;s say that, just like me, you want to create a new database table in your application to keep track of information about dogs.  We (by virtue of the same logic which affords physics problems friction-less vacuums with which to work in) already have a couple tables in our database: one pertaining to users (breeders or owners of dogs), and one pertaining to breeds.  We will keep it simple for now; all we want to know about a dog object for now is what its name is, what user it belongs to, and what breed it is.<br /><br />To add a Dogs table, we first need to create a file which will describe its model.  Part of this is describing what the relationship of the new model is to existing models, like User and Breed.  From real-world experience, we know that a dog generally has one user/owner, and one breed.<br /><br />So, create a file in <strong>app/models/</strong> called <strong>dog.rb</strong>, and type in the following:<br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class Dog &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />  belongs_to :user<br />  belongs_to :breed<br />end<br /></pre>Dog inherits Active Record.  Active Record&#8217;s sole purpose of existence is to help create associations between different objects.  This code will later be macro&#8217;ed out by Active Record into something more lower-level to create the associations.<br /><br />The lines that start with <code>belongs_to</code> describe the relationship that this new model has to existing ones.  Basically, a dog belongs to one owner/user, and to one breed.  <br /><br />Rails also has another keyword called <code>has_one</code>, which at first might also seem like an okay association to make between dogs and users; after all, a dog <em>has_one</em> user, right?  <a href="http://duanesbrain.blogspot.com/2006/05/ruby-on-rails-hasone-versus-belongsto.html">But belongs_to is more correct, because has_one implies more of a one-to-one relationship</a>, where you might be doing something like creating a new user every time you create a new dog.  Since users may later obtain more dogs, <code>belongs_to</code> would be more appropriate in the case you want to attach a new dog to an existing user.  (Note: belongs_to also makes it so that the Dogs table will have to be responsible for its foreign key with Users, whereas it would be the opposite case for has_one.)<br /><br /><br /><h3>2. Change your existing models to reflect their relationship to the new model</h3>Because a User can have many dogs, and have many different breeds of dogs, User should now look like this: <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;acts_as_authentic<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :dogs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :breeds, :through =&gt; :dogs<br />end<br /></pre>And because many dogs can be of a certain breed, and breeds can be owned by multiple owners, Breeds will look the same &#8211; <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class Breed &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :dogs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :users, :through =&gt; :dogs<br />end<br /></pre><br /><br /><h3>3. Generate a new migration</h3>Now you have to create a migration which, when run, will create the relevant tables in a structured manner.  You could also be hipster about it and edit SQL on your database by hand, but then you&#8217;d would have to tell the other people you&#8217;re working with of what you&#8217;ve done if they have local databases, or else run the same SQL on production databases.  With migrations, you can make changes modular, and even roll back changes easily.<br /><br />Run <code>rails g migration create_dogs_table</code>.  This will create a file in <strong>db/migrate</strong> which will look something like this: <br /><blockquote><strong>20110807213821_create_dogs_table.rb</strong></blockquote>The numbers on the left are a timestamp, which is needed by Active Record so it will know what migrations that you haven&#8217;t yet run, so that it can run them for you.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>4. Edit the migration file to describe what tables or columns should be added to your database.</h3>Open your migration file and type in these things: <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class CreateDogTable &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration<br />  def self.up<br />  end<br /><br />  def self.down<br />  end<br />end<br /></pre><code>self.up</code> is executed when a database is updated; <code>self.down</code> is executed when a database is rolled back due to errors.  So, in <code>self.up</code> you want to create your new tables and columns; in <code>self.down</code> you want to define code to remove those tables and columns.  With dog objects, all we said we cared about earlier was the name, so let&#8217;s just make a table which will (automatically) contain a unique ID, a timestamp, and a string for each dog object.  <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class CreateDog &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration<br />  def self.up<br />    create_table :dogs do | d |<br />      d.timestamps<br />      d.string :name<br />    end<br />  end<br /><br />  def self.down<br />    drop_table :dogs<br />  end<br />end<br /></pre><br /><br /><h3>5. Run the migration to create your table</h3>Run the migration by typing <code>rake db:migrate</code>.  Remember how the migration that we generated had a timestamp?  When you run <code>rake db:migrate</code>, Active Record can use those to figure out all the migrations that might have been added to your code base, which have not yet been run on a certain database (such as the one pertaining to production).  Also, because the code to create and drop data from a database is so high-level, it doesn&#8217;t really matter whether your actual code is in sqlite3 or in MySQL.  You can even use both depending on whether you&#8217;re in development or production stages.<br /><br />Hurray!  Now you have new tables and columns in your database!  <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><br />Sources: <br /><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kellydunn">Kelly</a></li><li><a href="http://ar.rubyonrails.org/">RubyonRails.org: Active Record</a></li><li><a href="http://duanesbrain.blogspot.com/2006/05/ruby-on-rails-hasone-versus-belongsto.html">Duane&#8217;s Brain: Ruby on Rails : Has_One versus Belongs_To</a></li></ul></div>

Kelly has been being really hipster and avoiding auto-generating files :P But thanks!  Now that I know how to create stuff &quot;model dog&quot; should be easier.  Also, &quot;change&quot; sounds definitely more convenient.  Thanks!</div>

If you do &quot;rails g model dog&quot;, the model, migration, tests and test helper files are automatically generated.  <br /><br />Also, in Rails 3.1, you don&#39;t have to define both up and down methods if down is obvious from what up is.  You can just define a method &quot;change&quot; with the contents of &quot;up&quot; would have been, and rails can figure out &quot;down&quot; by itself.<br /><br />The only caveat is that if change is drop_table, you have to use down and up, because rails can&#39;t figure out what columns to add back if you roll back the drop.</div>

It was for a position that I felt was made for me &#8211; involving writing, drawing, design, some management too.  (Managing soothes me because I feel like I have an eye on everything that&#8217;s going on.) Despite my enthusiasm I think I still wasn&#8217;t able to explain myself properly, and I blame it in some part on Skype.  I struggle with communicating effectively over electronic things like phones and video-chats.  People&#8217;s eyes don&#8217;t meet, there are no visual cues, they don&#8217;t see that I&#8217;m fiddling with the cork of this delicious Cupcake Red Velvet wine that I finished yesterday as I think.<br /><br />The internet connection is faulty.  Did they understand what I said?  Did I really understand what they said?  Am I being too silly?  <em>Are my feelings of pure love for video game design and story reaching you through these pixels?</em><br /><br />Man, I love the comfort of words that you can think through before you write, then think through after you write, then revise if necessary.<br /><br />One thing they asked was for further demonstration of my ability to sketch things out in perspective, or make layouts, so after RPG today (every Tuesday with the other interns) I drew out a short rendition of Little Red Riding Hood, the whole of which you can view <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/post/8727734003/sf-day-43-mondays-man-sf-day-44-had-an">on Tumblr</a>, where it looks much prettier, thanks to the whole <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/08/good-design-moves-tumblr-has-made.html">tiled photosets</a> thing.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve drawn things &#8220;with perspective&#8221; since the endless corridors of elementary school, but these were fun to do. :)</div>

There is one thing in particular that I wish Skype would change about its UI, and I think it&#8217;s mostly influenced by my experience using another <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/05/playerio-thoughts-on-bigdb.html">2.0-y bright blue user interface</a>.<br /><br />I&#8217;m talking about the little side menu that comes up over your chat messages, which offers you a variety of possible actions for that message.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sgPTg-1XhdE/TkNONrn37eI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/ejBSr5mVeLw/s1600/skype2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="116" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sgPTg-1XhdE/TkNONrn37eI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/ejBSr5mVeLw/s640/skype2.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">man, I should have taken a bigger screenshot</td></tr></tbody></table><br />When I am clicking on my own chat, these are the things that I probably want to do, in order:<br /><br /><ol><li><b>Edit </b>whatever foolish, silly thing I just wrote</li><li><b>Remove</b>&nbsp;whatever now-irrelevant thing I just wrote</li></ol><div><br /></div><div>I can only imagine <b>Copy</b>&nbsp;or <b>Quote</b>&nbsp;to be useful in cases when I want to be snarky. &nbsp;(<i>I already said that! &nbsp;Exactly 5 minutes and 3 seconds ago!</i>) Or maybe if I&#8217;m cross-posting between chats? &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know. &nbsp;I accept there is a use case that I haven&#8217;t encountered for those options.</div><div><br /></div><div>Nevertheless, <b>what I really wish I could do in Skype is click <i>anywhere</i>&nbsp;on a chat-message of mine and have it open up into something I could immediately edit</b>, much like Player.IO&#8217;s treatment of objects in its database. &nbsp;The menu could then be reserved for the lesser use cases of Removing, Copying, or Quoting.</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of the menu, could we also make that little arrow larger? &nbsp;The little arrow that opens that menu in the first place?</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V7fU6z-5WlI/TkNNvNn6bMI/AAAAAAAAAWI/3vOz8JgvCK8/s1600/2011-08-10_1256.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="120" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V7fU6z-5WlI/TkNNvNn6bMI/AAAAAAAAAWI/3vOz8JgvCK8/s640/2011-08-10_1256.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">do you see it?</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>Since there&#8217;s nothing usually relevant to the right side of the chat-message anyway, it would help a lot if the hitbox for the menu was larger. &nbsp;Also, if the menu opened up automatically, instead of me having to click it&#8230;!</div><div><br /></div><div>Just thinking about it is exciting. :D</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<strong>Tiled Photosets</strong><br />If you wanted to post more than one picture at a time on Tumblr, it used to be that the pictures would be placed into a little slideshow applet.  It was really elegant and cute; you would see one picture at a time, and could press a little rounded arrow to move on to the next picture.<br /><br />The problem is, no one would use it.  Or at least, if people did post this way, it didn&#8217;t get interacted with.  (At least, I didn&#8217;t, and the rare frequency with which I met up with a photoset on my dashboard makes me think that others didn&#8217;t really like this method of posting either.)  On Tumblr people just scroll, scroll, scroll.  Occasionally laugh.  And don&#8217;t stop for your dang photosets.<br /><br />Then, suddenly!  A tiled photoset appears!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CZrjAQAmsGI/TkCxzPGtDgI/AAAAAAAAAVg/78Ui_m8CiTk/s1600/photoset.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="526" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CZrjAQAmsGI/TkCxzPGtDgI/AAAAAAAAAVg/78Ui_m8CiTk/s640/photoset.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">with varied photo sizes, even!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />All of a sudden, you can see all the pictures in a photoset at once!  Plus the given layouts for different pictures make them all look really artsy, which Tumblr users love, because let&#8217;s be honest, over half of us are there just reblogging stuff.  Though another mark of how cool this feature is is how people have taken creative liberties with it, making sets of images like <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/8598587153/flashinglightsandecstasy-lol-xd">this</a>, or <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/8572474978">this</a>, or even <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/8436544789">this</a>.<br /><br />Making a feature which fits with how people actually use the product, and allows them to be creative?  ++!<br /><br /><br /><strong>Reblogging Tags</strong><br />I actually just noticed this today.  Never again will I have to repopulate the tags of something that I&#8217;m reblogging.  As an example, <a href="http://textless.tumblr.com/">textless.tumblr</a> is a great blog for macro photography of insects (and other animals), and the photographer always dutifully tags all of his posts with whatever is pictured.  <em>Wooly Aphid.  Larva.  Wasp Mimic. Secropia Silkmoth.</em>  (These tags often even get cut off in the dashboard post.  I can&#8217;t find an example now, but may later.)  In any case, though I love the accuracy of it, no way am I going to spend any time tagging these reblogs with anything more than &#8220;photo&#8221; and maybe &#8220;bug.&#8221;<br /><br />Fortunately, now tags also get reblogged!  So, now reblogging things can make you feel even more productive with even less energy. :)<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S_bvkOlgoOE/TkC4Lq-KX2I/AAAAAAAAAVo/bnrweSPmG8E/s1600/photoset2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="258" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S_bvkOlgoOE/TkC4Lq-KX2I/AAAAAAAAAVo/bnrweSPmG8E/s400/photoset2.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">thanks, tumblr. &nbsp;you the bomb</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><strong>Edit:</strong><br />Now if only tags were easier to remove than pressing that teensy little X beside every rounded-corner box.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oWzXOJfPEgI/TkNLEo_SODI/AAAAAAAAAV4/7vyWJbuxfDA/s1600/tumblr3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oWzXOJfPEgI/TkNLEo_SODI/AAAAAAAAAV4/7vyWJbuxfDA/s400/tumblr3.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Edit 2:</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This feature was eventually removed. I wonder why :(</div></div>

@jshou I was thinking about it!  I was thinking I could probably make a set of my favorites on Flickr and then randomly populate them everytime that page loads.</div>

I&#8217;ve always been more of a cat person, but recently I&#8217;ve been mad for shiba inu.  I found one in the FarmVille suite and it made my day.  I&#8217;m too shy to visit him all the time, but it&#8217;s enough to see him now and again.<br /><br />I found another shiba at the company meeting, and, typical of shiba aloofness with strangers, he did not care in the slightest that I adored him.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-74D_Hl1tbpk/Ti-wzOFiDcI/AAAAAAAAAUE/ZcMr3K-nsoc/s1600/DSC_0119%2B%25282%2529.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-74D_Hl1tbpk/Ti-wzOFiDcI/AAAAAAAAAUE/ZcMr3K-nsoc/s640/DSC_0119%2B%25282%2529.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh whoa i found a stick lol nom nom nom</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I cannot really explain why I started loving shiba inu with the abruptness and ferocity with which I did despite my general &#8220;:|&#8221; feeling about dogs, but it probably has something to do with this video, at least initially:<br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_uIshkpeXko" width="425"></iframe></center><br /><br />(More videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL957844FC81969564&amp;feature=mh_lolz">here</a>!)<br /><br />During breaks at work I&#8217;ve been searching for shiba inu-related stuff to read, and found <a href="http://juicybits.com/Shosha/_history.php">History and Tradition of the Japanese Shiba-Inu by Julia Cadwell</a>.  It goes,<br /><br /><blockquote>Today’s Shiba has been bred by careful mixing of many strains of small Japanese dogs.</blockquote><br />And then,<br /><br /><blockquote>The first impression the Japanese Shiba Dog creates is a lack of sophistication—a touch of nature that has escaped human forced breeding. Actually the Japanese Shiba Dog has escaped much artificiality that accompanies improvement and fixation of species.</blockquote><br /><em>lol wat</em><br /><br />In other news, this idea of shiba inu being attractive because they are in part so wild and &#8220;not completely obedient&#8221; reminds me intensely of tea ceremony aestheticism, of the beauty it finds in odd numbers, in asymmetrical and lumpy pottery, in things that are perfect because of their imperfection.<br /><br />Finding a job and then finding a shibanakama are some of the reasons why I am excited to return home. :3</div>
