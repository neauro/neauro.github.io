<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So much (mostly online) research on shiba inu has gotten dog-related information spilling out of my ears, so I decided to keep it all <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApA7ip7Sl9C8dC1uM0V3TEQ5R19pVmVGNjRSZjkyeEE&amp;hl=en_US">organized</a>.<br /><br />Here are the more interesting things I learned, which may only be interesting and novel because I have never owned a dog before:<br /><br /><br /><h3>There is such a thing as a raw food diet for pets.</h3>The diet has you feeding your dog raw meat &#8211; chicken, beef, pork, deer.  There is also a &#8220;prey model&#8221; variation in which meat is fed to an animal in the same proportions and states that it would obtain in natural settings.  (To illustrate, there&#8217;s a weirdly endearing photo of a kitten feasting on a cottontail rabbit on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_feeding#Prey_model">wikipedia page</a>.)<br /><br />In addition to raw food research, I was surprised to learn that some pet foods like Purina, which always seemed pretty classy, is apparently <a href="http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/purina-dog-chow/">really bad</a>.<br /><br />To me, the take-aways of a raw diet are as follows:<br /><br /><ul><li>Dogs are carnivores.  Eating raw meat, along with loving you, is what it has evolved to do.</li><li>Some kibble is highly processed and contains questionable items like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omnivore%27s_Dilemma">corn and soy</a>.</li><li>The <a href="http://truthaboutpetfood.com/articles/they-talk-but-can-they-give-answers.html">advertising</a> and studies behind pet food can also be questionable, as someone discovered when she called pet food companies to ask about the content of the food and how it was made.</li><li>Raw meat and meaty bones (RMBs) scrub a dog&#8217;s mouth more effectively than kibble or even kibble specialized to brush your dog&#8217;s teeth.  Also, raw diets may lead to a dog smelling better, being more energetic and obedient, and feeling nicer to the touch.</li><li>Though there is bacteria and parasites in raw meat, there are things you can do to lessen the chance of infection in your dog, and in general dogs are pretty well-built to withstand the stuff that they put in their mouths.</li></ul><br />I&#8217;ve looked at a lot of sites about this topic, some that speak <a href="http://rawfed.com/myths/">more strongly</a> than others, and though the overall consensus is that there is &#8220;no data&#8221; for whether a raw food diet is noticeably better for your dog or not, I&#8217;m more inclined treat the food industry with suspicion concerning the questionable things it already does to humans.  That being said, I would feel torn feeding a shiba something like beef knowing that cows are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAFO">raised so badly</a> anyway.<br /><br />Still, the idea of feeding a shiba inu a nice fresh fish makes me happy.  Also, now that I think about it, my old cat Dusty didn&#8217;t subsist completely on pet food either; he had dry kibble and also human tuna, which we started feeding him once a day (and which he loved) after he got urinary tract infection and had to have surgery.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/4137744452/in/photostream" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0R0GvnE5Yyw/TmcXLLVI-0I/AAAAAAAAAc8/YBSoh4SQMl4/s640/4137744452_149316bb07.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">if my lola&#8217;s cats can handle this, i&#8217;m sure US cats can too</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />As a note, I found <a href="http://rawfeddogs.net/Recipes/">a website with a variety of raw food recipes</a> &#8211; though I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was expecting when I started browsing it, hahaha.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>Raw bones are okay to give to a dog; cooked bones aren&#8217;t.</h3>Cooking makes bones brittle and easily splintered, which is not good.<br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/t10yEI64nzc" width="560"></iframe></center><br /><br /><br /><h3>Dog-training is like programming.</h3>Someone on the Shiba Inu Forum <a href="http://www.shibainuforum.org/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=8321">complained that her puppy was &#8220;stealth peeing,&#8221;</a> saying, &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t give any warning when she pees on the carpet - she&#8217;ll be sitting and she&#8217;ll stand up and pee. No sound, no movement around looking for a place to go. Just up and squat, done in a second.  Generally, we try to grab her and take her outside as soon as we see it, but she&#8217;s usually done before we can grab her&#8230;&#8221;<br /><br />To which someone replied, &#8220;This may be a habit she has picked up. She may have learned that if she pees a little bit, you will take her outside to pee.&#8221;<br /><br />And for some reason this amazed me.  Dogs are <em>literal</em>.  Quite computer-like.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>Dogs become easily hydrated, but are also easily over-watered,</h3>which can lead to messes.  Who knew?  When I had Dusty, I just allowed him to have access to water all day.  I guess when you have puppies, it&#8217;s a good idea to give them water and monitor them and make sure you can take them outside when you can.<br /><br /><br /><br />To conclude, here is another shiba inu video that Kelly showed me, to remind me of what the point of all this trouble is.<br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hwvCDA5CuEc" width="420"></iframe></center></div>

For some reason what I really want to feed a dog is fish!  Raw fish, or maybe little fish snacks.  Hopefully I can find ones with no added salt once the time comes!</div>

Just make sure you don&#39;t feed your dog overly-seasoned foods (salty, etc) or feed them off the table. The former is unhealthy and the latter will teach them bad manners, even though their adorable behavior may make you want to give in :P</div>
