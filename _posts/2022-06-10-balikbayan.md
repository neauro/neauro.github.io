I have my first publication out in [Solarpunk Magazine](https://solarpunkmagazine.com)!

It was written for their May 2022 Microfiction Contest, which was themed "Solarpunk in Asia and the Pacific Islands." I wrote it fresh off finishing Alex G. Pacman's <em>Filipino Ghost Stories</em>, and wanted to mix ghost stories with the solarpunk aesthetic and a healthy dose of diaspora mango angst.

Recently I've been really interested in solarpunk and utopian stories; given The Times they're especially soothing.
