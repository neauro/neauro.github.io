  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;ve been spending the past couple of weeks finishing up winter quarter. &nbsp;I took &#8220;Theoretical Foundations of Human-Centered Design and Engineering,&#8221; in which I broke everything that I had assumed about HCDE&#8217;s underlying theories, and then reconstructed it again, more tentatively. &nbsp;The essence of the class is this:<br /><br />HCDE is multidisciplinary. &nbsp;HCDE is the swordsman, archer, mage, token female healer, your entire roleplaying party <i>in one subject</i>. &nbsp;As such, the people who develop theories and &#8220;rules of thumb&#8221; for HCDE all come from varying backgrounds; you can find things relevant to HCDE across a range of journals and conference papers, from cognitive science to sociology to computer science. &nbsp;An advantage of this is the incredible breadth of information that goes into the formulation of this beautiful HCI thingcreature; a disadvantage is that everyone has different ideas of what HCDE should be, and sometimes not a clear idea of where to go <i>next</i>&nbsp;with the study of HCDE, since all our knowledge of it is so spread out. &nbsp;Just imagine what physics would have been like without everyone agreeing on that first instrumental apple-fall, much less talking about it with the same words.<br /><br />We learned about a handful of theories, most of which you can learn about on our group website, <a href="http://neauro.com/hcde501/">HCDE Bistro</a>, which aims to make these potentially&nbsp;mind-boggling&nbsp;theories digestible for the mental palate. &nbsp;In general.<br /><br />In the end, I didn&#8217;t find myself particularly &#8220;aligning&#8221; with any theory as the end-all foundational theory for HCDE, but activity theory and semiotic engineering resonated with me in particular. &nbsp;Activity theory runs off the idea that humans have &#8220;needs&#8221; that they satisfy through interacting with the word (such as a &#8220;need&#8221; to eat to sustain oneself), and that their activities are performed with <i>intention</i>. &nbsp;Semiotic engineering frames design artifacts as objects of &#8220;discourse&#8221; through which the designer has a conversation with a user, with the goal being that the user should learn how to perform their tasks more effectively. &nbsp;Semiotic engineering to me sounded quite a bit like game design &#8211; an artifact which is meant to communicate with a user and teach them best practices? &nbsp;Sign me uuup.<br /><br />At the end of the class we were to write a paper, and mine was about what a combined perspective of semiotic engineering and activity theory can help one understand about <strike>players</strike> users learning about how to work with a design beyond &#8220;this button does X.&#8221; &nbsp;It is located <a href="http://neauro.com/hcde501/activityengineering.pdf">here</a>.<br /><br />In conclusion: HCDE has a lot of people asking questions of it. &nbsp;How do I best design for this person, this situation, with this technology? &nbsp;Activity Theory answers, <i>It depends on what the person&#8217;s intentions are</i>; Distributed Cognition answers that&nbsp;<i>It depends on what other people or objects the person relies on to think and remember things</i>; Semiotic Engineering answers that&nbsp;<i>It depends on what the person learns from the designer&#8217;s artifact</i>; and so on.<br /><br />HCDE: five hundred ways to say <i>It depends</i>.</div>

I played Dear Esther last week, which shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise since Everyone Is Talking About It. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q64DenBNx5M/T0FszTbcjpI/AAAAAAAAAqc/P5c9ZcTpbSI/s1600/esther1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q64DenBNx5M/T0FszTbcjpI/AAAAAAAAAqc/P5c9ZcTpbSI/s320/esther1.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a screenshot near Dear Esther&#8217;s opening</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Playing it felt like being in a </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ride" style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">dark ride</a><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> &#8211; the level guides you along paths worn or fenced, and occasionally you get a glimpse of the &#8220;aerial,&#8221; framed between giant stone features. Going the long way to examine scenery inevitably brings you back to the golden path, which is nice, because backpedaling would have been painful in a game with no running.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">No running means that there&#8217;s no way to rush through anything. In some ways being forced to slow down is comforting; rushing has been ingrained in me, rush to wake up, to get to work, to get back, to do homework.  But in this game taking your time is coerced, is allowed. You can slow down to look at the cyan particle spray of ocean waves hitting the shore, to look at the rot-scarred timbers framing stone steps clotted with yellowbloom brush, to look at the mysterious luminescent chemical bonds and electrical diagrams splattered on the walls.</span></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TgKCtu9j37E/T0Fs2h8Ic5I/AAAAAAAAAqk/5HHiuqOVQo8/s1600/esther2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TgKCtu9j37E/T0Fs2h8Ic5I/AAAAAAAAAqk/5HHiuqOVQo8/s320/esther2.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a screenshot containing one of those creepy candles that <i>never melted</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I have to admit that more than once I wanted to do more than look.  I wanted to pick up the Bible on the ground and see what pages were bookmarked, I wanted to pick up medical instruments from trays of bloody water.  Which is, I guess, why I felt like this game was so much of a dark ride: you play, sitting in your cart, immersed but unable to touch anything.<br /><br />I guess one advantage of being unable to interact with things is that there&#8217;s less pulling you from the immersion of the environment &#8211; what would picking up a Bible have looked like, after all?  Like a book rising from the ground and opening magically inches from your eyes?  After a while I would have taken it for granted, but something so blatantly game-like would have been jarring the first time, would have reminded me that this world is a game.  A couple times your character acts on his or her own &#8211; near the beginning, you duck to avoid an impromptu seagull &#8211; when you enter dark places, your flashlight flickers on, wordlessly.  At moments like these it was easy to think that you  the player were actually perched on the optic nerves of a very un-curious person, hallucinating a Bri&#8217;ish narrator and their descent into madness.<br /><br />A feature of this game is that, though voice-overs are triggered as you make your way to certain areas, some are selected randomly to play, making for a story whose gem-glass plot-points feel jagged, don&#8217;t quite fit together, rupture your reason-making.  It could make the game an interesting one the second time around, I guess &#8211; that random number generator might dole you out a new snatch of calming Englishman script.  Though I want to consume all the text related to this story, I&#8217;m not quite tempted to play it over again, at least not just yet.<br /><br />In conclusion: it&#8217;s cool that Dear experimental Esther is being received so well!  I&#8217;m glad to see people open to the new and unconventional things that video games can express, though there is some argument whether Dear Esther is a Real Game or not.<br /><br />Other articles about Dear Esther to check out: <a href="http://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2011/04/ludodiegesis-or-pinchbecks-unified.html">Ludodiegesis, or Pinchbeck&#8217;s unified field theory of FPS games, or &#8220;please pee on my leg and tell me it&#8217;s raining.&#8221;</a>, <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2012/02/dear-eisenstein.html">Dear Eisenstein</a>, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EMcNeill/20120215/9442/On_Dear_Esther.php">On Dear Esther</a></div>

<h2> Tree rot</h2>happens when a tree sustains a large wound near or on its trunk and fungus moves in before the tree can &#8220;callous&#8221; over the hurt area.  The fungus eat away at the wood fiber, but some trees (like oak) can remain structurally sound by &#8220;compartmentalizing the decay,&#8221; or allowing the fungus to eat away only at the wood that is already dead at the tree&#8217;s center, and not at the tree&#8217;s new growth rings.  Some trees can even develop a &#8220;rams-horn,&#8221; which is when tree growth curves inward.  This keeps the tree standing sturdy.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<a href="http://www.spryfox.com/">Spry Fox</a> recently released their game Triple Town on iOS!  It lags a bit and takes time to load, but it&#8217;s a wonderful, addictive match-3-esque game.  It&#8217;s freemium; the first thousand or so &#8220;steps&#8221; are free, and you can purchase more steps with coins you earn as you complete levels.  Or, you can purchase the game for $3.99 in the App Store.<br /><br />You match three &#8220;Grass&#8221; to make a &#8220;Bush;&#8221; three &#8220;Bush&#8221; to make a &#8220;Tree;&#8221; three &#8220;Tree&#8221; to make a &#8220;House;&#8221; and so on.  Bears emerge randomly and three of them, trapped between landscape features, become gravestones that coalesce into a &#8220;Church.&#8221;  A starting board is a mostly-clear glade of grass and stones; successful boards are freckled with red-bricked civilization.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_Y2LY7M-xcQ/TzFgCE8mlvI/AAAAAAAAApE/7zu4Cj_O_LI/s640/blogger-image-1126259615.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_Y2LY7M-xcQ/TzFgCE8mlvI/AAAAAAAAApE/7zu4Cj_O_LI/s640/blogger-image-1126259615.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a screenshot of Triple Town</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I remember testing a bit of this game at the first <a href="http://www.seattleindies.org/">Seattle Indies</a> meet-up, and hearing Dan Cook tell me about how TT is at its heart <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/danctheduck/status/168044325006086144">a tragedy</a>.  The world starts bare and green, and inevitably you fill it with your colonization, reducing native bears to treasure-yielding clusters of churches.  I both appreciate this level of depth and am uncomfortable with this limited level of engagement of the important, sad, and real history of imperialism which still oppresses people today.  In this game there is nothing but to be the colonizer.  There is no success reachable through means alternative to keeping bears exactly where you want them, preventing movement until finally they homogenize into something beneficial to you.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OFKgNppvbDc/TzFgCoQT5tI/AAAAAAAAApM/iOp5cEdbdg8/s640/blogger-image--987295304.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OFKgNppvbDc/TzFgCoQT5tI/AAAAAAAAApM/iOp5cEdbdg8/s640/blogger-image--987295304.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">occupy, bears!!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Games go on until the entire board is filed with items, at which point any bears you have become gravestones and your score is tallied. &nbsp;Even when you lose, you still come away with something, whereas your &#8220;opponent&#8221;, the bears, will always die.<br /><br />It&#8217;s a wonderful game,&nbsp;<i>just</i> a game, <i>just</i> a brown bear and a gray headstone. &nbsp;But it does make me aware that some people can simply enjoy this game for what it is, even muse of its tragedy, and never have to feel like it&#8217;s their own.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
This past Superbowl Sunday a subset of ex-Dathouse roommates (plus me) got together, ate some chips, and had a draft!<br /><br />We went with three packs of Dark Ascension, which was a little &#8220;meh&#8221; since I feel unimpressed by DA rares. &nbsp;My first was a Fiend of Shadows that I passed up for a Lingering Souls. &nbsp;My second was Flayer of the Hatebound, and my third was Havengul Lich, which would have been<i>&nbsp;really</i>&nbsp;nice to open first&#8230;.aahhh. &nbsp;As it was, I had already drafted green/red/white, which is what I find myself doing 90% of the time. &nbsp;(But man, can you imagine a deck revolving around Havengul Lich and Hatebound? &nbsp;That would have been so fun! &nbsp;Casting low-cost creatures from the graveyard just to deal damage with Hatebound&#8230;I&#8217;d even passed on a Curse of Bloodletting at some point.)<br /><br />I started off unreasonably salty because Andy at my right had picked up all the Immerwolves I had hoped to get, but I ended up finishing second (to Andy!). &nbsp;I had three Nearheath Stalkers and a couple Flings which (when equipped with an Executioner&#8217;s Hood against a blue/black deck) put in the work.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HJlK3_DP4G0/TzDL7kJQ8GI/AAAAAAAAAo8/irHnIqXOBWA/s1600/nearheath-stalker.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HJlK3_DP4G0/TzDL7kJQ8GI/AAAAAAAAAo8/irHnIqXOBWA/s320/nearheath-stalker.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">have you ever looked closely at this art? &nbsp;it&#8217;s terrifying (<a href="http://theroundtablet.com/2012/01/10/nearheath-stalker-by-michael-c-hayes/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Since I didn&#8217;t have the Immerwolves, I experimented splashing white for a Niblis of the Urn, a pair of Burden of Guilts, and a Curse of Exhaustion, which I just wanted to play with. &nbsp;I managed to get it out once, but not during any clutch games. &nbsp;At the end of it all, Andou noted that in draft people often spend a lot of their mana playing one heavy drop during their turn, rendering something like Curse of Exhaustion not as useful.</div>

<i>This quarter I am facilitating a game design class at Puget Sound Community School for fun and lols. &nbsp;This is my story.</i><br /><br /><i>Other weeks can be found <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">here</a>.</i><br /><br />Last week&#8217;s game was <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/587905">/ ESCAPE \</a>. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a simple yet compelling game; you press the escape key to wall-jump, timing it right so you don&#8217;t get&nbsp;electrocuted&nbsp;by spikes embedded by the walls or the huge laser approaching you from the bottom.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_rajI-3FEw/T0pxVu3Q9mI/AAAAAAAAArg/iUKjsetx2c4/s1600/escapescreen.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_rajI-3FEw/T0pxVu3Q9mI/AAAAAAAAArg/iUKjsetx2c4/s400/escapescreen.png" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of / ESCAPE \</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The students said they could feel a sense of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>, and that when they lost, it was in a way so brief and shameless that they found themselves launching right back into the game again without really feeling like they had ever &#8220;stopped&#8221; playing. &nbsp;The fact that the music continued to play on even after death contributed to this, and someone pointed out that the background music made them want to tap ESC to the beat, which was relevant, because the topic of the day was sound.<br /><br />I started with asking what games they felt had strong &#8220;sound design,&#8221; whatever that means, and people listed off games like Metroid and Limbo for its sense of loneliness, Bioshock for its background music immersing you into its bygone pseudo-golden era. &nbsp;Andou supplied me with a particularly moving section of Limbo with which to show the class and everyone shuddered appreciatively.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/i3wmQb7LWZc" width="560"></iframe></center><br /><br />Some applications of sound that I found presented on the internets, as well as some that we brainstormed:<br /><br /><ul><li>Sound can make you feel emotional &#8211; sad, afraid, victorious</li><li>Sound can be used as positive or negative feedback &#8211; <i>You did something right!</i> &nbsp;Or, <i>NO, STOP IT</i></li><li>Sound can be used to give NPCs life, i.e. when they look over at your character dashing by them in a loud rush</li><li>Sound can be used as a reward, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgjHZa6Ag58">a la Zelda</a></li></ul>I also found and presented parts of&nbsp;<a href="http://cruiseelroy.net/2011/06/portal-2-music/">this very lovely breakdown</a>&nbsp;of what makes the music in Portal 2 so delightful and downright wonderful, which was good especially for me since I consider myself not extremely music-savvy, and I think would be hard-pressed at times to think about music and the effect that it&#8217;s having on me and my psyche. &nbsp;Contrast with Andou, who at any given moment during a game or movie will remark something like, &#8220;Oh look, it&#8217;s an intimate moment because romantic music is playing,&#8221; and I&#8217;ll realize that oh right, there <i>is</i>&nbsp;music playing.<br /><br />Following that article, I talked about encoded and embodied sounds, the ~*Universal Language*~ of music and how music in games, rather than speaking about the actions occurring <i>now</i>, may be more important in telling the player what will happen <i>next</i>: in the case of Limbo especially, blaring horns signal significant events, echoing splashes mean you&#8217;re moving deeper into an enormous lonely world.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

something called <a href="http://axcho.com/wordloops">Wordloops</a>, based on this year&#8217;s theme of &#8220;ouroboros.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is that you connect words together, starting the next word on the letter the previous word ended with, and after you fill certain criteria you &#8220;complete the loop&#8221; and proceed on to Loop N+1. &nbsp;Alex told me that it&#8217;s much better to make loops of small words, since you&#8217;re trying to get the most loops out of 3 minutes of play, but I personally found it really satisfying to make nice, long, wandering loops, and one of the students helped me see why: it&#8217;s because when you type a letter, a sound plays, and that sound goes higher the more letters you play. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the sound of <i>increasing</i>, <i>progressing,</i>&nbsp;<i>getting better</i>. &nbsp;And it&#8217;s at odds with the idea that<i>&nbsp;the smaller loop is best</i>.<br /><br />Sounds!<br /><b><br /></b><br /><b>Sources</b><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2263/gdc_2005_report_what_makes_music_.php">Gamasutra: GDC 2005 Report: What Makes Music for Games &#8216;Music For Games&#8217;</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2232/postcard_from_gdc_2005_gdc_mobile_.php">Gamasutra:&nbsp;Postcard From GDC 2005: GDC Mobile - Novel Ways to Use Audio in Games</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2189/enhancing_the_impact_of_music_in_.php">Gamasutra: Enhancing the Impact of Music in Drama-Oriented Games</a></li></ul></div>
