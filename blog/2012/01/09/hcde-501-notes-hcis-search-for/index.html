<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
The field of Human-Computer Interaction started in the 1980s, borne of cognitive and computer science.  It started with the idea that humans and computers both have behaviors that are algorithmic, and at a human&#8217;s heart is a little processor chipping away at data and outputting actions accordingly.  Around this time, Xerox came out with The Graphical User Interface. &nbsp;It was a novel framework for user interaction, and people were like, &#8220;Whoa!&#8221; And thus was cognitive science applied to improving GUIs by the millions.<br /><br />Soon, however, people became dissatisfied.  HCI as it was, hand-in-hand with cognitive sciences, was as limited as a college girl off at Ivy League and still dating someone in senior year of high school.  They had a lot of good moments the past year, they had some times that were defining of each other&#8217;s identity, but in the end, HCI just needed to broaden out, because humans don&#8217;t have processor hearts.  Suchman (in <em>Plans and Situated Actions</em>) was arguing with AI researchers in the dorm hallway and HCI, having left her door open for potential visitors, overheard.<br /><br />&#8220;Human action is &#8216;situated,&#8217;&#8221; Suchman said.  Humans respond to opportunity when it knocks, and are flexible to a change in resources.  &#8220;Computer programs may follow algorithms, but people do not.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Just look,&#8221; Suchman said, &#8220;at all these people who struggled with the design of this photocopier (1987).  If people were <em>truly</em> algorithmic, they would have tried to solve their usability problems in the same way.&#8221; Alas, everyone found their way to hatred of this copy-machine in a multitude of ways.<br /><br />This idea, this <em>situatedness</em>, drew right from Ethnomethodology, the guy in the opposite hallway, who grew up with nice sociology parents but had somehow turned out to be unusually rebellious and anti-theoretical.  He was all about moment-by-moment actions analyzed as reponses to events in a &#8220;local scene of action.&#8221; He was all about figuring out what made you (or groups of you) tick, and making you efficient, consistent, coherent.  He was best friends with Anthropology, whose whole life was about having comprehensive knowledge about every acquaintance and passerby.<br /><br />Ethnomethodology was pretty cool, but his parents never got over it.  They couldn&#8217;t compromise.  They tried to keep other people away from him, and to this day Ethnomethodology remained relegated to &#8220;a radical antitheory position.&#8221;  His wish to work above generalization and abstraction were shoved into a corner, and eventually even Anthropology, once a wide-eyed fact-hoarder, left and became theoretical herself.<br /><br />It was alright.  Ethnomethodology continued.  He focused.  He loved conversation, eventually produced rules about it: &#8220;turn-taking,&#8221; &#8220;repair,&#8221; &#8220;back-channeling.&#8221; In doing so he embraced something his parents had always wanted: generalization.  Soon he was spouting things like &#8220;highlighting for perception&#8221; and &#8220;professional vision,&#8221; and every multi-syllable ambiguity sent him an inch further down &#8220;the slippery slope of theorizing.&#8221;<br /><br />But it wasn&#8217;t enough for the kind of foundational theory HCI was really looking for.  HCI hung out with him a couple times, but as the years went on their interactions degenerated from brief hellos, strained smalltalk, unanswered Facebook Event invites.  Ethnomethodology had an &#8220;attitude of indifference&#8221; which didn&#8217;t seem that stable.  HCI kept a memory of empirical studies, of software usage data, but eventually all those nights she spent with him underneath the moon, talking &#8211; just, <em>talking</em>, about anything &#8211; faded.<br /><br />HCI <i>needed</i> that foundational theory. &nbsp;She wanted to learn more, not just about herself and her many facets (Psychology, Sociology, Computer Science, and so on), but about what she wanted to <em>do</em> with her life.  It wasn&#8217;t so much about trying to make all these different parts of her speak on the same level, but more about having an understanding of her own identity above them all.  Without theory she couldn&#8217;t compare the past to the present, couldn&#8217;t learn about whether she was really becoming better.  She couldn&#8217;t know whether her next step forward was actually a step back.  She couldn&#8217;t know whether some pet peeve of hers was typical, couldn&#8217;t decide what was important.<br /><br />Without theory, she couldn&#8217;t be as good as Science, who was not useful because she was always real or always right, but because she was always helpful and wanted.  Science could stumble, could even make mistakes: but even those missteps led to progress.<br /><br /><br /><br />Source:<br />Kaptelini &amp; Nardi, <em>Acting with Technology: Activity Theory and Interaction Design.</em> 2009.</div>
