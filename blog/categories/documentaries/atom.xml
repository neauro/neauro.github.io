    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the kindness of R, I was able to attend the final day of the <a href="http://seattleaaff.org/2014/">Seattle Asian-American Film Festival</a>, an event whose existence I was only barely aware of before R invited me.</p>

<p>We had tickets to see two full documentaries and one short experimental film.</p>

<h2><em>One Generation’s Time: The Legacy Of Silme Domingo &amp; Gene Viernes</em> | <em>To Manong Carlos</em></h2>

<blockquote>One short experimental film followed by documentary feature, <em>One Generation’s Time: The Legacy of Silme Domingo & Gene Viernes</em>.</blockquote>


<p><em>One Generation&rsquo;s Time</em> is about the work that Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes did to bring equal working conditions the Filipinos employed seasonally at Alaska canneries. In the 1970s, white workers had access to better food and better living situations than Filipinos doing the same work. Furthermore, on days with less work, rather than being allowed to rest, Filipinos were instructed to move empty cans from one side of warehouses just so they were paid for &ldquo;doing something.&rdquo; Silme and Gene were both murdered for their work, and the documentary discusses the political motivations of the murders, and how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos">Marcos dictatorship</a> was involved. The film was directed by Shannon Gee.</p>

<p><em>To Manong Carlos</em> is a short film directed by Adrian Arilla, about his experiences as a Filipino coming to live and call America his home.</p>

<p>Why you should watch these:</p>

<ul><li><em>One Generation's Time</em> introduces the complicated situation and political machinations of behind Silme and Gene's work well; probably because, as Shannon Gee said in a panel afterward, she herself was entirely new to this story.</li>
<li><em>To Manong Carlos</em> is a beautiful film where Arilla's experiences are interspersed with quotes from Carlos Bulosan's <em>America is in the Heart</em>. Reading these quotes alongside Arilla's modern experiences gives a special poignancy to Bulosan's "old" writings, which are still incredibly relevant today. In a media atmosphere where the stories of Filipinos are either rarely told or outright suffocated, it's moving to remember that we <em>do</em> have stories, that we have a history. We don't drift to America as "minority" individuals separate and small, but that we follow and build on the work and words that have come before us.</li>
</ul>




<h2><em>Seeking Asian Female</em></h2>

<blockquote><em>seeking asian female</em> is an eccentric modern love story about Steven and Sandy—an aging white man with “yellow fever” who is obsessed with marrying any Asian woman, and the young Chinese bride he finds online. Debbie, a Chinese American filmmaker, documents and narrates with skepticism and humor, from the early stages of Steven’s search, through the moment Sandy steps foot in America for the first time, to a year into their precarious union. Global migration, Sino-American relations and the perennial battle of the sexes, weigh in on the fate of their marriage in this intensely captivating personal documentary. (<a href="http://www.seekingasianfemale.com/the-film/">Seeking Asian Female</a>)</blockquote>


<p>I&rsquo;ve been dying to see <em>Seeking Asian Female</em> since coming across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbGrQe17cU">the trailer</a> a year or two ago. Watching it at the Seattle Asian-American Film Festival was particularly gratifying, as the entire theater was groaning and laughing every time a white person swooned about the &ldquo;servant girl&rdquo;-ishness and &ldquo;green papaya fragrance&rdquo; of the Asian women they saw (and smelled?) in their minds.</p>

<p>Why you should watch it:</p>

<ul><li>It's as hilarious as it is cringe-worthy. You cringe and laugh as you cringe.</li>
<li>The story is well told.</li>
<li>The director does a great job telling the story of Sandy, the "Asian Female" of this film, and also examines the ethics of herself being in the middle of this relationship.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m happy that something like the Seattle Asian-American Film Festival exists, and hope it continues next year. Watching both movies, I was reminded of N&rsquo;s quote at our last AB meeting: &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t tell our stories, our stories tell us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Documentaries are my whitenoise of choice. Due to studying, I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot more of them on Netflix.</p>

<p>More recently, I&rsquo;ve two documentaries about orcas: <em>Killer Whales</em> by the Discovery Channel, about the behavior of killer whales in the wild; and <em>Blackfish</em>, about orcas held in captivity. They&rsquo;re both pretty incredible; I&rsquo;m shocked at how much footage there is of killer whales doing things, whether it&rsquo;s hunting poisonous sting rays in New Zealand or yanking human beings into pools by their ankles.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hilarious to watch the footage of killer whales hunting seals in the first documentary, with a voiceover of a man marveling at their intelligence; and to watch this footage again in the second, where the background noise is preserved, and a woman is panicking, &ldquo;Oh no! Oh no! <em>On noooo</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Blackfish</em> also connected nicely with the last essay in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Science-Nature-Writing/dp/0547350635">The Best American Science and Nature Writing (2011)</a>, though the writer states there that one of the orca trainers was pulled by her hair into the water, whereas trainers in the <em>Blackfish</em> movie argue that this is a lie, another way to &ldquo;blame the victim&rdquo; of the orca attack, rather than the orca itself and the poor treatment that drove it to &ldquo;psychopathy.&rdquo;</p>
