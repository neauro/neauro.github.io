I don&#8217;t usually like the stem (despite it actually being sweeter than the florets), but it&#8217;s easier for me to eat if I cut it up into small pieces.  Might as well use all the pounds you paid for, right?  <em>Fun Fact</em>: I can&#8217;t find evidence of this now, but my old cooking teacher told me that it&#8217;s better to tear broccoli rather than cut it.  <em>Fun Fact #2:</em> We&#8217;re not using it here, but this reminds me that I read garlic yields more of its nutrients to you if you mince it than if you leave it in chunks.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NyHRsjf7lK8/TmRDSVyzoZI/AAAAAAAAAac/W3g6kW8Idtg/s1600/DSC_0011.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NyHRsjf7lK8/TmRDSVyzoZI/AAAAAAAAAac/W3g6kW8Idtg/s640/DSC_0011.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i always really liked the cross-sections of mushrooms and broccoli stems</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li><strong>Once the potato has been in for around 30 minutes, throw the broccoli into a pot of water and start bringing it to a boil.</strong> Once it starts boiling, turn the heat down low or turn it off completely and let it drain in a colander.  This is to prevent the broccoli from becoming over-cooked and leaking all its nutrients into the water besides.  (It&#8217;s probably better to steam it, but I don&#8217;t have a steamer and am always too lazy to look up hacky ways to steam.) The florets can hold a lot of water, so make sure you press out all the moisture either now or as you&#8217;re eating so that stuff doesn&#8217;t get soggy.</li><li><strong>Around this time, I also start frying the mushrooms.</strong> Specifically, I do it with Trader Joe&#8217;s Spanish Olive Oil, and sprinkle on rosemary and freshly ground seasalt.  Why freshly ground seasalt?  Because when I searched the cabinets of the place I&#8217;m subletting, all I could find was a canister of large seasalt grains and a porcelain mortar and pestle.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1OOtVvICJ0k/TmRDeL7IcuI/AAAAAAAAAak/JCfADhKtSGQ/s1600/DSC_0013.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1OOtVvICJ0k/TmRDeL7IcuI/AAAAAAAAAak/JCfADhKtSGQ/s640/DSC_0013.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i wonder if it really makes the salt taste better</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li><strong>Once the mushrooms start looking pretty cooked, turn down the heat.</strong> It&#8217;ll depend on you how cooked you want the mushrooms to be, though I generally like them pretty brown myself.  I wouldn&#8217;t be frying them for more than 10 minutes or so.</li><li><strong>Once the potato has been in the oven for an hour and a half to two hours, take it out.</strong> I generally err on the side of waiting longer for the potato, since I love it when they&#8217;re soft and mushy on the inside.  Plus this makes the skin crispier!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4mp2iXyqTUQ/TmRDmSqMVwI/AAAAAAAAAas/fzKhIbIkjVg/s1600/DSC_0014.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4mp2iXyqTUQ/TmRDmSqMVwI/AAAAAAAAAas/fzKhIbIkjVg/s640/DSC_0014.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">an armor of crunchy deliciousness</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ol><br /><br /><h3>   How to Eat</h3>I generally slice the potato in half, put in liberal amounts of minced Jarlsberg, and then hold the potato closed so that it will all melt into gooey deliciousness.  Then, eat with the mushrooms and broccoli in whatever proportions you desire. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f2IrirrJ0Sc/TmRIoWdiXTI/AAAAAAAAAa4/KDNnnbwFibM/s1600/DSC_0015.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f2IrirrJ0Sc/TmRIoWdiXTI/AAAAAAAAAa4/KDNnnbwFibM/s640/DSC_0015.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">mmmmmmmmm</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><h3>   Cost</h3>Laziness always brings me to the closest grocery for ingredients, which happens to be Whole Foods.  This is how much I spent at my last visit today: <br /><ul><li>White mushrooms, 0.40 lb at 3.99/lb &#8211; $1.60</li><li>Broccoli crowns, 1.02 lb at 2.99/lb &#8211; $3.06</li><li>Russet potato, 1.46 lb at 1.99/lb &#8211; $2.91</li><li>Jarlsberg &#8211; $4.00</li><li><strong>Total: ~$11.57</strong></li></ul><br />Everything was organic and thus more expensive, but this sort of stuff always makes me aware that &#8220;eating healthy&#8221; can really be a class issue.  I&#8217;m not saying that this is the healthiest meal on the planet, but it&#8217;s probably better than a McDonalds dinner, with a trade-off that it&#8217;s more expensive money-wise and time-wise.  I&#8217;m privileged in that I don&#8217;t work so hard each day that it&#8217;s difficult for me to find time to cook, much less find time to cook for myself <em>and</em> a family.  I mean, come on guys.  $8 for two potatoes, 5 mushrooms, and 3 broccoli crowns?</div>

Nope, it really did start at age 24 when I last checked!  Very strange.  I tried to find that page again when writing this post and couldn&#39;t, can you tell me how you found it yourself?<br /><br />Even if it is &quot;the programming bit&quot; (HAHA) that made us seem more &quot;male&quot; than we are, it still makes me wonder how they calculate a gender binary for certain topics, and what it would take to change it.  With Google, it&#39;s probably not some all-knowing human christening these different, inanimate topics with specific genders :P</div>

I assume you meant 25 to 34 years? I checked my own ad preferences and yup, I was thought of as a male between the ages of 25 and 34 as well. XD Does that mean we have similar interests overall, or is that just because of the programming bit?</div>

I&#8217;ve been really into dogs recently (it goes with the whole <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/shiba-inu-musings.html">shiba inu thing</a>, I guess), so last night when I found a new documentary on dogs I jumped on it.  I&#8217;ve already watched a couple dog-related documentaries but this one still turned out to have some new information.  For one, the documentary pointed out that human emotions are not distributed evenly across the face.  If you were to split a person&#8217;s face in half, and then mirror it to itself to get a complete human face, you&#8217;d end up getting two faces that have somewhat different &#8220;feelings&#8221; expressed in them.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W6UVeeNQG1k/Tl-opC3JTCI/AAAAAAAAAY8/pPXobU5YKGA/s1600/rightleft.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="353" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W6UVeeNQG1k/Tl-opC3JTCI/AAAAAAAAAY8/pPXobU5YKGA/s640/rightleft.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">to me, Right seems more confident; Left, benevolent</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There&#8217;s also a theory that emotions are more faithfully represented in the right side of the face, which is, coincidentally, the side of the face that we as humans tend to look at first when examining a face.  They showed a study which showed this, outlining human gazes with lasers and showing that people generally looked at another person&#8217;s right eye first, then the left &#8211; but to me this kind of seems typical of how I would look at anything first.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4jjhTZGEbCE/Tl-o2rdlFaI/AAAAAAAAAZE/PNoP9qalNys/s1600/heatmap.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="530" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4jjhTZGEbCE/Tl-o2rdlFaI/AAAAAAAAAZE/PNoP9qalNys/s640/heatmap.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">for example. (<a href="http://www.t3node.com/blog/tiny-introduction-to-heatmaps/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I wonder if this still holds true for humans whose language reads from right to left.  Though, I guess regardless of whether the &#8220;leftward gaze&#8221; does hold true for humans, it does seem to hold true for dogs, who would also look to the right side of a human&#8217;s face first.  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hLDQ9b7SEoc/Tl-o7mYOAqI/AAAAAAAAAZM/1z_ZFyI-09A/s1600/dogleft.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hLDQ9b7SEoc/Tl-o7mYOAqI/AAAAAAAAAZM/1z_ZFyI-09A/s640/dogleft.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">puppy dog eyes</td></tr></tbody></table><br />No other animals interact this way with humans, and no other dogs do this with other dogs.  It is almost as if <em>dogs have a special relationship to humans.  Whoa.</em><br /><br />Another special thing that dogs do: bark.  Wolves don&#8217;t bark at all, but domesticated dogs have a variety of noises, which their owenrs can often interpret as <em>wanting to play</em>, <em>angry I hate strangers!</em>, etc.  In general, people tend to forget on how humans and dogs must have evolved together; in fact, when we think of how humans evolve we tend to look at primates like chimpanzees, but it turns out that chimps, like many other animals, don&#8217;t understand the human gesture of pointing.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m_Kln1ikwHo/Tl-pACDW2wI/AAAAAAAAAZU/qdnphWcM6z4/s1600/chimppoint.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="356" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m_Kln1ikwHo/Tl-pACDW2wI/AAAAAAAAAZU/qdnphWcM6z4/s640/chimppoint.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wat lol give me food</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Pointing is a human gesture that is informative in nature, and helping someone to get food by pointing is something that seems to be pretty unique to humans/humans or humans/dogs.  Chimps in the wild would apparently never run into a situation where they would point at a banana to indicate its presence to another chimp, though wow, I would be really surprised if this were true.  Still, dogs&#8217; ability to read humans is so good that they not only follow pointing, they can follow human <em>gazes</em>.  Human eyes, by the way, are pretty easily followed, what with the white sclera and dark iris, and it may have evolved to be this way because it facilitated better communication.  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LRJ1GdKEpA0/Tl-pEETl7EI/AAAAAAAAAZc/cyv_gTGPB2o/s1600/eyes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="222" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LRJ1GdKEpA0/Tl-pEETl7EI/AAAAAAAAAZc/cyv_gTGPB2o/s400/eyes.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">o___o</td></tr></tbody></table><br />As for the evolution of dogs, genetic testing seems to prove that they undeniably came from wolves, and not any other dog-like creature like coyotes or foxes.  Dogs and wolves can even interbreed; but wolf cubs raised as closely with humans as puppies still don&#8217;t grow up domesticated.  They don&#8217;t react to the pointing thing, they aren&#8217;t interested in hanging out for lols, etc.  So the domestication of dogs is definitely <em>nature</em> versus <em>nuture</em>.  In fact, some people in Russia made up an experiment in which they bred domestication into a species of silver fox, by allowing breeding between foxes only if they were not vicious toward the handlers.  Within six generations, researchers had some really adorable, tame foxes.  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_aeyZhUKHIQ/Tl-pHsY5-iI/AAAAAAAAAZk/NR2eB15DE6E/s1600/tamefox.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_aeyZhUKHIQ/Tl-pHsY5-iI/AAAAAAAAAZk/NR2eB15DE6E/s400/tamefox.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I can hear Tumblr crying out</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Though it turned out, that, the more domesticated silver foxes became&#8230;  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L5OMP-H1zPk/Tl-pKpzSWUI/AAAAAAAAAZs/9dj_OUMgZxw/s1600/fluffy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="179" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L5OMP-H1zPk/Tl-pKpzSWUI/AAAAAAAAAZs/9dj_OUMgZxw/s320/fluffy.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">unnff so fluffy</td></tr></tbody></table><br />&#8230;the more their physical appearance changed.

I am excited to go back home and stop programming (on others&#8217; whims) for a while, though one semi-sad thing I must accept is that I will probably have to wait a while to have a stable living situation and stable amount of money before getting the shiba inu that&#8217;s been keeping me going all summer. &nbsp;It&#8217;ll just be too hard to manage rent, tuition, <i>and</i>&nbsp;a dog, at least for a while.</div>

&quot;wat lol give me food&quot; is an impulse that I&#39;m starting to realize is really hard to get rid of in general.  Free food at work all the time == me overeating all the time.  It&#39;s so delicious and so painful</div>

This past weekend my boyfriend came down to visit.  After much ado, we managed to obtain a rental car.  Who knew it was so difficult to rent cars when you&#8217;re younger than 25 and don&#8217;t have a credit card?  Age and the ability to spend money you don&#8217;t have presupposes responsibility and maturity, I guess.<br /><br />Though, I&#8217;m fine paying an extra $25 for the privilege of being young and having a relatively smaller amount of responsibilities. :D<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6094860009" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xKo9ES0Oj48/TlxdRywDkRI/AAAAAAAAAYU/NNGXKGmsg7o/s320/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo2_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">derpaka &amp; shibaru on the dashboard</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The day alternated between fog and sunshine.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GHB28f0mFOo/Tlxc6_pzFtI/AAAAAAAAAYM/dPl25qEsmBc/s1600/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo1_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GHB28f0mFOo/Tlxc6_pzFtI/AAAAAAAAAYM/dPl25qEsmBc/s320/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo1_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">starting out</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZF_kNEUyn_M/Tlxd4cVLNXI/AAAAAAAAAYc/oJ7bFzDXmSY/s1600/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo3_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZF_kNEUyn_M/Tlxd4cVLNXI/AAAAAAAAAYc/oJ7bFzDXmSY/s320/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo3_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">aaaand some 20 miles later</td></tr></tbody></table><br />What&#8217;s visible from the highways of California always impresses me on a level that I can&#8217;t quite explain.  I love how the environment seems to change from mile to mile, how one state can be all at once chilly and arid, all farms and then all dunes, here grass and there <em>ice plants as far as the eye can see</em>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZqTlDGEd9lA/TlxfktmV6AI/AAAAAAAAAYk/Js-IdlUFJKQ/s1600/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo6_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZqTlDGEd9lA/TlxfktmV6AI/AAAAAAAAAYk/Js-IdlUFJKQ/s320/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo6_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">in retrospect, why didn&#8217;t we stop here?!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Eventually we arrived at destination point #1, my childhood home.  Here is where I had my first cat and my first birds, where I rejected my first Barbie doll and watched things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kablaam">KaBlam!</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(TV_series)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> until unreasonable hours of the morning.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DIPkUIL0TTc/TlxgAnRw2QI/AAAAAAAAAYs/gZGIpS2qtAw/s1600/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo8_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DIPkUIL0TTc/TlxgAnRw2QI/AAAAAAAAAYs/gZGIpS2qtAw/s320/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo8_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">one of the cars outside this place actually had WA plates</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then we moved on to our true destination, the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  I wish that I had remembered more of it, or more of the area in general; unfortunately a lot has been lost in time and memory.  The one area that I for sure remembered, the exhibit called <em>Beautiful But Deadly</em> at the top of one of the MBA staircases, was now something else like <em>Enchanted Kelp Forest</em>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6095459688/in/photostream" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-txNQrug275k/TlxjbFcRPSI/AAAAAAAAAY0/CbJn-2CFdYQ/s320/6095459688_c62d5422fc.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">spotted jellyfish</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Because a lot of the exhibits were dark, I had a lot of trouble taking pictures of most things, and though I took my telephoto lens I ended up using my 35mm f/1.8 for the majority of the pictures, just so I could grab the light.  In general I had a good time, though the place was swarming with children and parents taking pictures of things, sometimes with a desperateness that was mind-boggling.  Do you really need a photo of your kids at <em>every</em> exhibit?  And sometimes the fervor with which people took photos of exhibits before even taking time to understand or really look at what was going on in them was frustrating.<br /><br />Anyway, this is coming from a person who really only enjoyed the aquarium for all the good <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/sets/72157627426562177/">photo opportunities</a>, so.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
The other day I tried applying to a job through the Amazon Careers website, and the experience was pretty interesting.<br /><br />The normal Amazon Careers website has a frame to the right which is the container for search results and job details.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tiEdJuD-92M/TlSShbRW-4I/AAAAAAAAAXU/VASbkoT6w2I/s1600/amazon2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tiEdJuD-92M/TlSShbRW-4I/AAAAAAAAAXU/VASbkoT6w2I/s640/amazon2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">aww yeah. &nbsp;so much opportunity for employment</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hjc2SGREjoo/TlSSmNRiiBI/AAAAAAAAAXc/r6P_kWXshuo/s1600/amazon3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="346" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hjc2SGREjoo/TlSSmNRiiBI/AAAAAAAAAXc/r6P_kWXshuo/s640/amazon3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the first listing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Unfortunately for me at the time, I was given a direct link to an internship which filled up the entire page.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FQD3hDyeSd0/TlSYFVqLdtI/AAAAAAAAAYE/v_ascKp2iqA/s1600/amazon22.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FQD3hDyeSd0/TlSYFVqLdtI/AAAAAAAAAYE/v_ascKp2iqA/s640/amazon22.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">does the font need to be that small?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I think the link itself is deprecated because I couldn&#8217;t find the job by searching through Amazon Careers, but I didn&#8217;t know this at the time. And the last time I tried to apply for a job to Amazon before this was a couple months ago, so I already had a profile, albeit completely unrelated to the position that I was applying for now.  Still, I pressed &#8220;Apply Now,&#8221; thinking that I could change that information before submitting.<br /><br />But the next page that showed up said, merely,<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpDjHR0C2c/TlSSxH52sVI/AAAAAAAAAXs/gJqwGgMfelY/s1600/amazon7%2B--%2Bstep%2B4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpDjHR0C2c/TlSSxH52sVI/AAAAAAAAAXs/gJqwGgMfelY/s640/amazon7%2B--%2Bstep%2B4.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wait&#8230;what about the first three steps?!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />&#8220;Step 4 of 4&#8221; could only mean &#8220;This is the last step before submitting your application,&#8221; so I applaud the transparency of it. &nbsp;Still, for some reason I went and clicked through anyway, thinking that I&#8217;d still be able to change what irrelevant or old information that I had on file.  I didn&#8217;t.  Ack!<br /><br />So I searched in haste for &#8220;My Account&#8221; to put in my application information. When I eventually found it It looks like this:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zp07gj5RBmI/TlSS07TDhJI/AAAAAAAAAX0/vzDs1gLiq5I/s1600/amazon5%2B--%2Byour%2Baccount.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zp07gj5RBmI/TlSS07TDhJI/AAAAAAAAAX0/vzDs1gLiq5I/s640/amazon5%2B--%2Byour%2Baccount.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">unexpectedly sparse</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The text is, to me, a little small for a page that has nothing else on it.  I guess it&#8217;s easily remedied by just increasing the font size. &nbsp;(Also, is that a dangling list element?)<br /><br />The &#8220;Your Profile&#8221; page is similar.  This is where you fill in all the information that will be used to apply to whatever job at Amazon that you so desire.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Wm2YVsUul4/TlSS67FYm4I/AAAAAAAAAX8/ETuOW4i4FfM/s1600/amazon6%2B--%2Byour%2Bprofile.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Wm2YVsUul4/TlSS67FYm4I/AAAAAAAAAX8/ETuOW4i4FfM/s640/amazon6%2B--%2Byour%2Bprofile.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is everything Amazon needs to know about you.<br />name, address, and the last three degrees you earned (not pictured)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />So then I uploaded my profile, and&#8230;what? &nbsp;I&#8217;m still not quite sure whether the updated information is being used for the application that I had already submitted.  I imagine that it is, but even so, a confirmation would be nice.<br /><br />These are the things that I wish had been different about this process in general:<br /><ul><li><strong>I want to see what information you&#8217;re submitting to a job</strong>.  Or, at least, a recap of what steps 1, 2, and 3 had been before I went through step 4.  Even now, months after first creating my account, I can&#8217;t reconstruct what the previous steps would have been.  &#8220;Sign up, Fill in Information, Find Job and Apply?&#8221;</li><li><strong>I want the ability to apply to jobs that are completely different in nature.</strong>  In particular, I wish that I had been able to submit different resumes to different jobs, or that I could provide a cover letter for each one.  (I normally hate writing cover letters, but this position in particular was one that I enjoyed writing a cover letter for.  Ah, wasted effort!</li><li><strong>I want less fields about what school you went to on your Profile page</strong>.  How many applicants does Amazon have every day that have been to <em>three</em> post-high school schools?  Are there enough to justify making <em>everyone</em> go through filling this spaces in?</li><li><b>I want a notification about selection or non-selection of a position.</b>&nbsp; The whole process is pretty automatic-feeling anyway, so having a confirmation e-mail that an application was selected, or an e-mail gently letting down your hopes would be nice, haha.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><div>As a note, in order to get the &#8220;Step 4 of 4&#8221; screenshot I pretended I was applying to another arbitrary job, and the application still went through though I pressed &#8220;back&#8221; rather than the final &#8220;Submit.&#8221; Out of curiosity, I just checked its status on the &#8220;Your Account&#8221; page.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DiZd3KoYPo/TlSV-PsCDwI/AAAAAAAAAYA/Mmc4a0s_LYQ/s1600/amazon8.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DiZd3KoYPo/TlSV-PsCDwI/AAAAAAAAAYA/Mmc4a0s_LYQ/s640/amazon8.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">it reads, <i>Reviewed, Not Selected.</i><br />oh well, i guess</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Which makes me think:</div><div><ul><li>Wow, someone reviewed my application fast!</li><li>Or else the computer just read through my resume quickly and tossed it out?</li><li>Wait, why are the other positions I applied to not showing up? &nbsp;Did my real application not actually go through? &nbsp;Or does this status thing just expire after a week or so?</li><li>Also, why does my application for the Design Intern position still say that my application is already on file, when this page obviously doesn&#8217;t have it listed?</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>In conclusion: I have a weird feeling that people don&#8217;t really get jobs through career websites, but through career fairs and internal connections, so I suspect the entire site is just a front anyway, haha.<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b>&nbsp;Oh! &nbsp;I did receive an automated &#8220;We received your application!&#8221; e-mail for the job I arbitrarily applied to just to obtain a screenshot. &nbsp;But it still reads &#8220;Reviewed, Not Selected&#8221; on the status page.<br /><br />¯\_(ツ)_/¯</div></div></div></div>

Chris came to visit!  And we visited San Francisco Zoo because I have wanted to and have not had buddies nearby that enjoy the act of going to the zoo enough to just go and bear with my taking pictures of everything.<br /><br />(Full set of zoo pictures is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/sets/72157627363783575/">here</a>.)  This time, though, I didn&#8217;t take hundreds of pictures like I normally do, probably because I&#8217;ve been to Woodland Park Zoo in the past couple months and because <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/raws-vs-jpeg-fine.html">I&#8217;m restricting myself to RAW now</a>, which means less space for pictures.  If I couldn&#8217;t see anything but an animal&#8217;s back then I usually just passed.  Being so conservative probably wasn&#8217;t complete necessary since I had about 300/500 shots left at the end of the day, but, so it goes.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6067715466/in/set-72157627363783575" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GGNwYYb04gM/TlHb4drP7hI/AAAAAAAAAWg/q8VB0E-92fY/s640/6067715466_3ef6295dd5.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">cool story bro</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Zoos are always kind of tough because on one hand, animals are great!

Information everywhere; not like the internet, but for easy perusal relevant to the current circumstances of one&#8217;s physical presence.  Eating lunch with Chris beside the flamingo pool, I looked down and saw that my burger was in a box lined with yet more information.  An explanation of why three of the nine subspecies of tigers are extinct.  Encouragements to eat organic and local.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5MfqMl1-fro/TlHu-lohGKI/AAAAAAAAAW0/LbBrqU3W5BE/s1600/200px-OmnivoresDilemma_full.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5MfqMl1-fro/TlHu-lohGKI/AAAAAAAAAW0/LbBrqU3W5BE/s400/200px-OmnivoresDilemma_full.jpg" width="263" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">ha! &nbsp;i see what you did there!<br />(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omnivore's_Dilemma">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />I can&#8217;t even think of any other places where people will happily go to be informed about something that is not really relevant to their everyday life, much less have a good chance of taking that information, finding it reasonable and un-offensive, and considering it, and acting upon it. &nbsp;Science museums are different, because everyone agrees <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-11-23/politics/obama.science_1_science-education-math-and-science-president-obama?_s=PM:POLITICS">science is good</a>; at the very least, someone would more easily agree to the idea that science is good, than to agreeing that &#8220;eating less meat is good,&#8221; or &#8220;ensuring impoverished people are not exploited for our benefit is good.&#8221;<br /><br />In any case, the quote in the Children&#8217;s Zoo seemed pretty legit &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember it exactly, but in essence it went, &#8221;<em>Teach children how to love something and they will work to protect it</em>.&#8221; The gorillas and the flamingos are martyrs.  The kid screaming at his half-finished Cheezit and bending down to pick it up and replace it in his mouth is a potential future warrior of the earth.</div>

&#8230;omg.  The human is cubicled in the zoo of society.  We are ALL unwilling martyrs.  But then for whose benefit is it?  Just our families and individual day-to-day survival?  Haha.</div>

Interesting point - I hadn&#39;t thought about zoos being a place where people go to be informed about something that&#39;s not directly relevant to them&#8230; Though maybe you could argue that almost all entertainment is like that. But you have picked out an important distinction, I think.<br /><br />Maybe they&#39;re martyrs, unwilling martyrs if that is even possible. The way I tend to think about it, which I realized a couple years ago at the zoo, is that these animals are no worse off than we are. The caged chimpanzee is to wild chimpanzee as the cubicled human is to prehistoric human. Better health care, perhaps, but everything else is so wrong. This is one reason why Avatar resonated with so many people, I think.</div>

This morning Kelly and Chris and I grabbed breakfast at Boogaloo&#8217;s in Valencia (which is delicious&#8230;and oh man, have I not actually eaten since then?!  It&#8217;s filling too!).  Then Kelly showed us his monome in his apartment, and I discovered his stash of Arpakasso.  I ask if I could take them away for pictures before he redistributes them to his sisters, he says yes, I frolic away and spend the rest of the day taking endearing shots.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6068256474/in/set-72157627364814073" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bIx2iqImLwM/TlHzdtelJpI/AAAAAAAAAXE/kb100UP2s-Y/s640/6068256474_27149e500d.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />One thing that I love about Arpakasso is the personality of each Arpakasso&#8217;s face.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
A couple nights ago I attended the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/gamesjs/events/27773901/#initialized">GamesJS Kickoff Meeting</a>, at which were speakers discussing the advantages of game development in HTML5 and JavaScript.  It was held at IGN.  The place turned out to be filled with a lot of indie game devs, and a lot of the advantages toted were that of the cross-platformability of games built using HTML5 and JavaScript, which can go on phones and computers without any worries of Flash compatibility.  Plus, for any indie game dev, to choose only one platform for your baby heavily limits its potential audience.<br /><br />I have to admit now that the only thing I know about HTML5 is that it has a &lt;canvas&gt; tag.  I know JavaScript, but not to its very fibers.  I was mainly going as a deep-dive, and man, there were so many technologies that I have never heard before, and am bookmarking here for later investigation:<br /><br /><strong>crafty.js</strong><br /><a href="http://craftyjs.com/">crafty.js</a> is the Flixel of JavaScript.  Collision detection!  Sprite maps!  Woo!<br /><br /><strong>jsFiddle</strong><br />The presentation for crafty.js had a lot of this <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a> stuff, which I guess is like a JavaScript console, which is super cool.  I talked to Kelly about it excitedly and he was like, &#8220;Yeah.  It&#8217;s pretty neat.  <span class="shh">I guess.</span>&#8221; lol kelly whatever<br /><br /><strong>Spaceport</strong><br /><a href="http://sibblingz.com/">Spaceport</a> is another game engine which aids cross-platform support from web to iOS.  Write your JavaScript and translate it to ActionScript like instantly!  It has super good performance and will be in public beta sometime in September.  You can purchase a license or, if you are a poor game dev, you can use Spaceport through a revshare model.<br /><br /><strong>V8</strong><br />During the Spaceport presentation, talk about something called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> suddenly happened.  It turns out that <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/v8/intro.html">V8</a> is Google&#8217;s &#8220;open source, high performance JavaScript engine…written in C++ and used in Google Chrome.&#8221;<br /><br /><strong>Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</strong><br />The last speaker was a woman from Google who spoke briefly about <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a>, which is a &#8220;Java software development framework&#8221; which allows you to build user interfaces, have client-server communication, etc.  You can deploy applications you make to the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.<br /><br /><strong>PlayN</strong><br />I couldn&#8217;t actually find a link for this yet, but PlayN is relevant to games on Google+.<br /><br /><br />There is just SO MUCH technology in the world.  People didn&#8217;t really talk to each other during the meetup (then again, I came late and perhaps wasn&#8217;t trying hard enough to ~*network*~ with everyone), but still, being in a place like this really makes me feel inspired to learn more about everything.<br /><br />Afterward, Kelly, Jonah and I walked through downtown talking about all the places we&#8217;ve been and the bros we had and went to Bi-Rite Creamery.  I tried the Dainty Gentleman, which is a concoction of: 2 scoops of honey lavender ice cream, with drizzles of hot fudge and blood orange olive oil, sprinkled with seasalt.  You would not believe the amazing flavors that comes out of this combination.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
For whatever reason, adding a model to a database in Rails took me forever to understand.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kellydunn">Kelly</a>, I now have model-making in Rails down to an art.<br /><br />Want to add a new table or a new column to your Rails application?  This is what you do!<br /><br /><br /><h3>1. Create a new .rb file for your model</h3>Let&#8217;s say that, just like me, you want to create a new database table in your application to keep track of information about dogs.  We (by virtue of the same logic which affords physics problems friction-less vacuums with which to work in) already have a couple tables in our database: one pertaining to users (breeders or owners of dogs), and one pertaining to breeds.  We will keep it simple for now; all we want to know about a dog object for now is what its name is, what user it belongs to, and what breed it is.<br /><br />To add a Dogs table, we first need to create a file which will describe its model.  Part of this is describing what the relationship of the new model is to existing models, like User and Breed.  From real-world experience, we know that a dog generally has one user/owner, and one breed.<br /><br />So, create a file in <strong>app/models/</strong> called <strong>dog.rb</strong>, and type in the following:<br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class Dog &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />  belongs_to :user<br />  belongs_to :breed<br />end<br /></pre>Dog inherits Active Record.  Active Record&#8217;s sole purpose of existence is to help create associations between different objects.  This code will later be macro&#8217;ed out by Active Record into something more lower-level to create the associations.<br /><br />The lines that start with <code>belongs_to</code> describe the relationship that this new model has to existing ones.  Basically, a dog belongs to one owner/user, and to one breed.  <br /><br />Rails also has another keyword called <code>has_one</code>, which at first might also seem like an okay association to make between dogs and users; after all, a dog <em>has_one</em> user, right?  <a href="http://duanesbrain.blogspot.com/2006/05/ruby-on-rails-hasone-versus-belongsto.html">But belongs_to is more correct, because has_one implies more of a one-to-one relationship</a>, where you might be doing something like creating a new user every time you create a new dog.  Since users may later obtain more dogs, <code>belongs_to</code> would be more appropriate in the case you want to attach a new dog to an existing user.  (Note: belongs_to also makes it so that the Dogs table will have to be responsible for its foreign key with Users, whereas it would be the opposite case for has_one.)<br /><br /><br /><h3>2. Change your existing models to reflect their relationship to the new model</h3>Because a User can have many dogs, and have many different breeds of dogs, User should now look like this: <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;acts_as_authentic<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :dogs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :breeds, :through =&gt; :dogs<br />end<br /></pre>And because many dogs can be of a certain breed, and breeds can be owned by multiple owners, Breeds will look the same &#8211; <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class Breed &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :dogs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :users, :through =&gt; :dogs<br />end<br /></pre><br /><br /><h3>3. Generate a new migration</h3>Now you have to create a migration which, when run, will create the relevant tables in a structured manner.  You could also be hipster about it and edit SQL on your database by hand, but then you&#8217;d would have to tell the other people you&#8217;re working with of what you&#8217;ve done if they have local databases, or else run the same SQL on production databases.  With migrations, you can make changes modular, and even roll back changes easily.<br /><br />Run <code>rails g migration create_dogs_table</code>.  This will create a file in <strong>db/migrate</strong> which will look something like this: <br /><blockquote><strong>20110807213821_create_dogs_table.rb</strong></blockquote>The numbers on the left are a timestamp, which is needed by Active Record so it will know what migrations that you haven&#8217;t yet run, so that it can run them for you.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>4. Edit the migration file to describe what tables or columns should be added to your database.</h3>Open your migration file and type in these things: <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class CreateDogTable &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration<br />  def self.up<br />  end<br /><br />  def self.down<br />  end<br />end<br /></pre><code>self.up</code> is executed when a database is updated; <code>self.down</code> is executed when a database is rolled back due to errors.  So, in <code>self.up</code> you want to create your new tables and columns; in <code>self.down</code> you want to define code to remove those tables and columns.  With dog objects, all we said we cared about earlier was the name, so let&#8217;s just make a table which will (automatically) contain a unique ID, a timestamp, and a string for each dog object.  <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class CreateDog &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration<br />  def self.up<br />    create_table :dogs do | d |<br />      d.timestamps<br />      d.string :name<br />    end<br />  end<br /><br />  def self.down<br />    drop_table :dogs<br />  end<br />end<br /></pre><br /><br /><h3>5. Run the migration to create your table</h3>Run the migration by typing <code>rake db:migrate</code>.  Remember how the migration that we generated had a timestamp?  When you run <code>rake db:migrate</code>, Active Record can use those to figure out all the migrations that might have been added to your code base, which have not yet been run on a certain database (such as the one pertaining to production).  Also, because the code to create and drop data from a database is so high-level, it doesn&#8217;t really matter whether your actual code is in sqlite3 or in MySQL.  You can even use both depending on whether you&#8217;re in development or production stages.<br /><br />Hurray!  Now you have new tables and columns in your database!  <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><br />Sources: <br /><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kellydunn">Kelly</a></li><li><a href="http://ar.rubyonrails.org/">RubyonRails.org: Active Record</a></li><li><a href="http://duanesbrain.blogspot.com/2006/05/ruby-on-rails-hasone-versus-belongsto.html">Duane&#8217;s Brain: Ruby on Rails : Has_One versus Belongs_To</a></li></ul></div>

Kelly has been being really hipster and avoiding auto-generating files :P But thanks!  Now that I know how to create stuff &quot;model dog&quot; should be easier.  Also, &quot;change&quot; sounds definitely more convenient.  Thanks!</div>

If you do &quot;rails g model dog&quot;, the model, migration, tests and test helper files are automatically generated.  <br /><br />Also, in Rails 3.1, you don&#39;t have to define both up and down methods if down is obvious from what up is.  You can just define a method &quot;change&quot; with the contents of &quot;up&quot; would have been, and rails can figure out &quot;down&quot; by itself.<br /><br />The only caveat is that if change is drop_table, you have to use down and up, because rails can&#39;t figure out what columns to add back if you roll back the drop.</div>

It was for a position that I felt was made for me &#8211; involving writing, drawing, design, some management too.  (Managing soothes me because I feel like I have an eye on everything that&#8217;s going on.) Despite my enthusiasm I think I still wasn&#8217;t able to explain myself properly, and I blame it in some part on Skype.  I struggle with communicating effectively over electronic things like phones and video-chats.  People&#8217;s eyes don&#8217;t meet, there are no visual cues, they don&#8217;t see that I&#8217;m fiddling with the cork of this delicious Cupcake Red Velvet wine that I finished yesterday as I think.<br /><br />The internet connection is faulty.  Did they understand what I said?  Did I really understand what they said?  Am I being too silly?  <em>Are my feelings of pure love for video game design and story reaching you through these pixels?</em><br /><br />Man, I love the comfort of words that you can think through before you write, then think through after you write, then revise if necessary.<br /><br />One thing they asked was for further demonstration of my ability to sketch things out in perspective, or make layouts, so after RPG today (every Tuesday with the other interns) I drew out a short rendition of Little Red Riding Hood, the whole of which you can view <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/post/8727734003/sf-day-43-mondays-man-sf-day-44-had-an">on Tumblr</a>, where it looks much prettier, thanks to the whole <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/08/good-design-moves-tumblr-has-made.html">tiled photosets</a> thing.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve drawn things &#8220;with perspective&#8221; since the endless corridors of elementary school, but these were fun to do. :)</div>
