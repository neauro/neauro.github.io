<span class="sig">What is a remote procedure call (RPC)?</span><br />RPC is a paradigm for providing communication across a network between programs written in a high-level language.  &#8220;Procedure calls&#8221; in general are a well-known and well-understood way of transferring control and data within a program on a single computer &#8211; a program calls a procedure, giving it certain arguments, and receives some output from the procedure back.  So, a remote procedure call &#8211; when a program calls a procedure that is not necessarily on the same system that the program is on &#8211; should be workable as well.<br /><br />An RPC &#8220;cycle&#8221; goes like this:<br /><ol><li>A remote procedure is invoked by a caller, who passes the procedure parameters</li><li>The caller&#8217;s environment is suspended as it waits for a response</li><li>The parameters are passed across the network to the environment where the procedure will execute</li><li>The desired procedure is executed</li><li>When the procedure finishes executing, the results are passed back to the calling environment</li><li>The caller&#8217;s environment resumes with the new data (or else fails, I assume, because of a timeout&#8230;though the &#8220;Implemented remote procedure calls&#8221; didn&#8217;t use timeouts, since single-machine systems don&#8217;t)</li></ol><br /><br /><span class="sig">What are the advantages of RPC?</span><br /><ol><li><strong>Clean and simple semantics.</strong>  <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/01/intro-to-distributed-systems.html">Distributed systems</a> are complicated because communication throughout one is complicated, so simplicity is good.</li><li><strong>Simplicity.</strong>  Which means it&#8217;s probably fast.</li><li><strong>Generality.</strong>  Procedure calls work in single-machine systems, besides being usable in distributed systems.</li></ol><br /><br /><span class="sig">What are the disadvantages of RPC?</span><br />There are some design issues &#8211;<br /><ul><li>What semantics do you use when the machine fails, or when communication fails?</li><li>What are the semantics when a caller does something address-specific, and the caller and callee don&#8217;t have a shared address space?</li><li>How do you integrate RPC into existing/future programming systems?</li><li>How does a caller figure out the location and identity of the procedure it wants?</li><li>What&#8217;s a suitable protocol for the transfer of data?</li><li>How do you provide data integrity and security in an open communication network?</li></ul><br /><br /><span class="sig">Really general implementation</span><br />The structure of RPC is based on the concept of <em>stubs</em>; the parts of the program involved in an RPC (the user, the user-stub, the RPC communications package, the server-stub, and the server) are all executed on their respective places, and when a user wants to use an RPC, it really just calls its user-stub, which is what makes the RPC.  This way, specifying the target procedure and the arguments is sent in a &#8220;call packet&#8221; to the server-side stuff, which is handled similarly: the server-stub unpacks the packet, makes a local call to the procedure on the server, and packs it up again in a &#8220;result packet&#8221; to be sent to the caller.  This serves to encapsulate everything (I think?).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TSPV2_29a7I/AAAAAAAAADs/WoPFIW0-3zM/s1600/rpc%2Bstubs.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="161" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TSPV2_29a7I/AAAAAAAAADs/WoPFIW0-3zM/s320/rpc%2Bstubs.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">from &#8220;Implementing Remote Procedure Calls&#8221;</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The RPCRuntime handles the actual handling-off between the user-stub and the server-stub.<br /><br />The semantics of RPCs can also be handled without needing a specialized packet-level protocol.  <br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">Other notes:</span><br /><ul><li>RPC is supposed to make distributed computation more easy; in the &#8220;Implementing Remote Procedure Calls&#8221; paper, the authors hoped to solve the difficulty of distributed systems communication and leave only the problems of timing, independent failure of components, and the coexistence of independent execution environments.</li></ul><br /><br />Source:<br /><a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=357392">Andrew Birrell and Bruce Nelson.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So, for now at least, I&#8217;m taking a class on distributed systems.  <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/parallel/dsd-tutorial.html">Google</a> has a good tutorial on what a distributed system is, which I will take notes from/copy shamelessly.<br /><br />Firstly, definitions &#8211;<br /><strong>A protocol</strong> is &#8220;a formal description of message formats and the rules that two processes must follow in order to exchange those messages.&#8221;<br /><br /><strong>A network</strong> is &#8220;the infrastructure that links computers, workstations, terminals, servers, etc.  It consists of routers which are connected by communiation links.&#8221;<br /><br /><strong>A distributed system</strong> is &#8220;an application that executes a collection of protocols to coordinate the actions of multiple processes on a network, such that all components cooperate together to form a single or small set of related tasks.&#8221;<br /><br />My impression of it currently is also like this: a distributed system is a program that controls a ton of computers and with their powers combined accomplishes great things, like searching the internets for that picture of Maru wearing a crab hat.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">Advantages of a distributed system:</span> <br />Distributed systems can connect remote users with remote resources in an open and scalable way.  <em>Open</em> meaning that each component of the system can interact with other components at any time, <em>scalable</em> meaning that the system can be easily altered to accomodate changes in the amount of users or resources.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">Disadvantages of a distributed system:</span><br />A system of things working together is more complicated than a system of something working by itself.  An example of this is an airplane with two engines, which spend much more time on the ground than airplanes with a single engine, simply because planes cannot take off if anything is wrong with them, and there&#8217;s more to go wrong with an airplane that has more engines.<br /><br />Distributed systems have a lot of complexity because its components, the computers or servers or etc., have to interact properly.  An example of how difficuult the interaction can be can be found with the <strong>two generals problem</strong>, which goes like this:<br /><br /><blockquote>Two generals on opposite hillsides want to coordinate an attack.  General A sends a message &#8211; &#8220;Let&#8217;s attack at dawn!&#8221; &#8211; to General B.  How will General A know if General B agrees?  B will send a message in response &#8211; &#8220;Alright, let&#8217;s attack at dawn!&#8221; But then how will B know that A received his confirmation?  A will have to send a message back.  And then how will A know that B got the confirmation message?  B will have to send a message back&#8230;</blockquote><br />And so on and so forth.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">So, a well-designed distributed system will have these characteristics:</span><br /><ol><li>Fault-tolerant: if a components fails, it can recover without performing incorrect actions</li><li>Highly available: if a component fails, it can restore operations and continue to provide services</li><li>Recoverable: if a component fails, it can restart itself and rejoin the system after failure has been fixed</li><li>Consistent: in the event of failure, a system can still coordinate components</li><li>Scalable: if some aspect of the system is scaled to a larger size (i.e. if there are more users, or size of network increases), then the system can still work correctly</li><li>Predictable performance: the system can provide responsiveness in a timely fashion</li><li>Secure: the system can authenticate access to data and services</li></ol><br />With distributed systems, you have to <em>design for failure</em>.  If I told you to do something and you didn&#8217;t do it, is it because I didn&#8217;t tell you clearly what to do?  Or is it because you didn&#8217;t see me tell you?  Or is it because I didn&#8217;t get confirmation that you had done it?  This problem is the reason why distributed systems are so hard to debug &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to see where exactly the problem originated, or why it happened.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">Distributed systems design</span><br />Firstly, about client-server applications.  They work by having a <em>server</em> which provides some service, like processing database queries, and a <em>client</em> which uses the service, i.e. to show the database query results.  Different types of servers do different things: for instance, a database server houses databases and allows clients to access them, file servers manage disk storage, etc.  The communication between client and server needs to be reliable.<br /><br />Reliability is governed by protocols, like TCP/IP.  The Internet Protocol (IP) is a set of communication protocols that allow for communication on the internet and most commercial networks.  The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a core part of IP, and allows clients and servers to create connections to one another and exchange data in &#8220;packets.&#8221; Protocol guarantees reliable and in-order delivery of data from sender to receiver.<br /><br />With a distributed system, there can be many types of servers, and <em>service</em> is a term that refers to a set of servers of a particular type.  &#8220;Binding&#8221; is when a process that needs to access a service becomes associated with a particular server which provides the service.  Programs which which server to associate with through binding policies.  For example, someone looking for certain information on a database may be connected to a server which is closest to them geographically, so that access is faster, or he or she may be connected to a database which has the least number of people presently accessing it.<br /><br />To keep things reliable, a distributed service may keep multiple copies of data so you can still access it if something goes wrong.  To keep things going fast, a distributed service may <em>cache</em> data, which is when it makes copies of the data and keeps a copy of it locally, so the data can be accessed quickly the next time it&#8217;s wanted.  <br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">More about TCP/IP</span><br />The IP &#8220;suite&#8221; can be viewed as a set of layers, in which each layer uses the functions of the layers below it and gives functionality to the layer above it.  The lower layers are typically implemented in hardware, whereas the higher layers are implemented in software.<br /><br />The layers:<br /><ol><li>Application layer: is used by most programs that require netwrok communication.  The program gives data to this layer of protocol, and then encapsulated in a transport layer protocol.  Examples of applications that use this layer: HTTP, FTP. </li><li>Transport layer: is responsible for end-to-end message transfer, along with error control, fragmentation, and flow control.  End-to-end message transmission can be categorized as <em>connection-oriented</em> (TCP) or <em>connectionless</em> (UDP), with TCP being the more sophisticated and reliable.<br /></li><ul><li>TCP works by: first, ensuring the receiving computer is ready to accept data by using a &#8220;three-packet handshake&#8221; in which the sender and receiver agree they&#8217;re ready to communicate.  Then, TCP makes sure data gets to its destination.  If the receiver doesn&#8217;t acknowledge a packet of the data, TCP will automatically transmit the packet three times, and also split the large packet into smaller ones if needed so that the data can travel more reliably.  TCP will also drop duplicate packets and rearrange the ones that arrive out of sequence.</li><li>Note for self: What&#8217;s the relationship between this and torrenting something?  Also, I understand that TCP is a protocol, which means that it&#8217;s a &#8220;formal description,&#8221; so what&#8217;s with this &#8220;TCP making sure data reaches&#8221; and &#8220;TCP automatically transmitting&#8221; stuff as if it&#8217;s a program which does something?</li></ul><li>Network layer: solves the problem of getting packets across a single network, or, getting packets from one network to another network by moving the packet across a network of networks, i.e. the Internets.  IP performs the basic task of getting packets of data from source to destination.</li><li>Link layer: deals with the physical transmission of data, i.e. placing frame headers and trailers on packets for travelling over the physical network, and dealing with physical components.</li></ol><br /><br /><span class="sig">Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)</span><br />A remote procedure call (RPC) is another method besides TCP/IP that clients can use to interact with servers.  It&#8217;s based off the idea that the procedure that a client wants to use may not be in the same &#8220;address space,&#8221; i.e. the procedure is off on a different system with a network connecting them.<br /><br />So, when an RCP is made, the arguments are passed to a remote procedure and the caller waits for a response or a timeout.  Each incoming request to a server usually spawns a new thread, and a thread in the client issues an RPC and then waits, and resumes execution when it receives a reply.<br /><br />RPC-based code needs to do three things:<br /><ol><li>Specify the protocol for client-server communication</li><ul><li>The protocol is created by <em>stubs</em>, which are generated by a protocol compiler.  A stub is a routine that doesn&#8217;t do much other than to declare itself and the parameters it accepts &#8211; just enough to allow it to be compiled and linked.</li></ul><li>Develop the client program, which will call the remote procedure, pass it the required data, and receive returned data</li><li>Develop the server program, which will register the procedures that may be called by a client, and receive/return data required for processing.</li></ol><br />So, an RPC application uses classes made by the stub generator to execute an RPC, and then wait for it to finish.<br /><br />Some errors that may happen in RPC programming are binding errors, which will happen when a server isn&#8217;t running when a client is started); or version mismatches, if a client compiled against an outdated version of the server.  Timeouts will occur in the case of a server crash, network problem, or client computer problem.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TSN28QczM5I/AAAAAAAAADc/gDZxppbry4c/s1600/DSC_1015.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TSN28QczM5I/AAAAAAAAADc/gDZxppbry4c/s320/DSC_1015.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://sisinmaru.blog17.fc2.com/blog-entry-47.html">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Sources:<br /><a href="http://code.google.com/edu/parallel/dsd-tutorial.html">Google: Introduction to Distributed System Design</a><br />Lecture notes</div>

It makes a batch of about <strong>24 cupcakes</strong>:<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ingredients</strong><br /><ul><li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature</li><li>1 3/4 cups sugar</li><li>2 large eggs</li><li>2 large egg whites</li><li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li><li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li><li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li><li>1 cup milk</li><li>2 tablespoons matcha</li></ul><br /><strong>Instructions</strong><br /><ol><li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li><li>If you&#8217;ve got your roommate&#8217;s plastic-rubber cupcake things, you&#8217;re all set.  Else, prepare paper cupcake things by spraying with butter stuff&#8230;I guess.  (This recipe apparently also makes a cake, so you could butter up a 1/2 pan.)</li><li>Put the butter in a mixing bowl.  Grab some object from your roommate that looks like it could suffice for mixing.  (I use a cake icing spreader, but a spatula will probably work too.) Sit down on the ground, set the bowl between your thighs, and beat furiously.  You could think about that ex-whatever that you had <span class="shh"><strike>(but avoid thinking about how green tea is his favorite flavor&#8230;oh)</strike></span>.  At the end, the butter should be kind of whippy.</li><li>Add sugar.  Repeat the between-legs beating thing.  The mixture should be light and fluffy and could possibly be on your pants and the cuff of your shirt.</li><li>Beat two eggs with a fork and add it to the mixture.  Walk around the kitchen if you want.  Skip some songs on your iPod until you have something sort of fast-paced. (Last Alliance&#8217;s &#8220;Katahiza no Yogore&#8221; is good.) By now your arm might be getting kind of tired.  Don&#8217;t worry.  Just keep thinking about green tea cupcakes.</li><li>Separate the whites from another two eggs, beat the whites with a fork, and add, and mix until&#8230;everything&#8217;s all mixed together.  <strong>Optional:</strong> You might accidentally allow the yolk to bleed into the whites.  This is (probably) okay.  Add it anyway.  <strong>Extra note:</strong> The initial recipe actually called for two yolks, but I read it as &#8220;whites&#8221; somehow, so&#8230;well&#8230;by the time of this writing I&#8217;ve actually made this recipe a couple of times, and it worked both ways, pretty much. <strong>Also:</strong> Save the yolks for breakfast tomorrow!</li><li><strike>Whisk</strike> Grab another fork and another bowl and mix together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.  Add to batter and mix to combine.</li><li>Mix matcha in with the milk. Add to the batter and mix until combine.</li><li>Pour into cupcake things, about 3/4 of the way up.</li><li>Bake for 22-25 minutes until a cake tester comes out clean.</li><li>Remove from baking pans and then put something on them.  My favorite topping is cream cheese icing, but this time around we only put more green tea, which had the unfortunate side-effect of making the cupcakes look ominously moldy.</li><li>Set on a plate and offer to your roommates.  Take a bunch of pictures, pour out some sake, and consume~</li></ol><br /><strong>Notes:</strong><br />The green tea flavor in the cake is pretty subtle, so if you like matcha then you could probably get away with adding more.  I&#8217;ve tried using a matcha/sugar composite that I found in a store somewhere, but also powdered matcha itself, and they were both pretty good.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TSNrH_qbC7I/AAAAAAAAADY/NvZNYUUkNfQ/s1600/green+tea+cut.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TSNrH_qbC7I/AAAAAAAAADY/NvZNYUUkNfQ/s640/green+tea+cut.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">cupcake made with pure matcha</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TSNrGLccecI/AAAAAAAAADU/_pdrQWkdIgI/s1600/green+tea.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TSNrGLccecI/AAAAAAAAADU/_pdrQWkdIgI/s640/green+tea.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">cupcake with matcha/sugar mix</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

Again taken from <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/overview.html">t3h googs</a>, who developed protocol buffers in the first place.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">What are protocol buffers?</span><br />Protocol buffers are a &#8220;flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing structured data&#8221; &#8211; like XML but smaller, faster, simpler.  In this case, I assume that &#8220;serializing data&#8221; refers to converting some data structure into an object that can be stored and then unpacked again into another computer environment, i.e. storing a list into a file or something so it can be sent over a network and then opened up again and read by someone else.  So, a protocol buffer provides a way for data to be moved across multiple computers, which explains why it&#8217;s relevant to <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/01/intro-to-distributed-systems.html">distributed systems</a>.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">How do protocol buffers work?</span><br />You have data, and you want to serialize it so that you can trasmit it to another network or computer in a message.  To specify how you want to serialize it, you have to <strong>define protocol buffer message types in <code>.proto</code> files</strong>.  Each protocol buffer message is a small, logical record of information with a series of name-value pairs.  A <code>.proto</code> file which defines a message containing information about a Pokemon would be like this:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">message Pokemon {<br />    required string species = 1;<br />    required int32 id = 2;<br />    optional string trainer = 3;<br />    optional string nickname = 4;<br /><br />    enum Type1 {<br />        FIRE = 0;<br />        WATER = 1;<br />        GRASS = 2;<br />    }<br />}       <br /></pre><br />So in this case, I&#8217;ve got a message that serializes data about a Pokemon.  The message contains information about a Pokemon, its trainer, its id, its nickname, and its type.  For a message to be a well-formed Pokemon message, it must contain exactly one of <code>species</code> and <code>id</code>, but can have zero or exactly one of <code>trainer</code> or <code>nickname</code>.  The <code>enum</code> means that the Pokemon will have only one of a predefined list of values &#8211; that is, only one type out of the three given types.<br /><br />Once the messages have been defined, they&#8217;re run against whatever protocol buffer compiler you have for your application&#8217;s language, which will generate <strong>data access classes</strong>.  These will provide a way to access each field defined in the message.  So, if you were using C++, the data access class created would be called <code>Pokemon</code>, and you could then use this <code>Pokemon</code> class to populate, serialize, and retrieve <code>Pokemon</code> protocol buffer messages.  Then you send out the message like,<br /><br /><pre class="brush:cpp">Pokemon pokemon;<br />pokemon.set_species("Charmander");<br />pokemon.set_id(4);<br />pokemon.set_trainer("Red");<br />fstream output("file", ios::out | ios::binary);<br />pokemon.SerializeToOsteam(&amp;output);<br /></pre><br />and read it like,<br /><br /><pre class="brush:cpp">fstream input("file", ios::in | ios:: binary);<br />Pokemon pokemon;<br />pokemon.ParseFromIsteam(&amp;input);<br />cout &lt;&lt; "Pokemon: " &lt;&lt; pokemon.species() &lt;&lt; endl;<br />cout &lt;&lt; "Trainer: " &lt;&lt; pokemon.trainer() &lt;&lt; endl;<br /></pre><br /><span class="sig">What are the advantages of protocol buffers?</span><br /><ul><li>You can add new fields to message formats without breaking backwards-compatibility; old binaries will just ignore the new field.  So, extending the protocol is simple, and you can do it without having to worry about breaking existing code.</li><li>It&#8217;s simpler, smaller, faster, and less ambiguous than XML.  Plus, it generates the data access classes, which are easier to use in programs.  I imagine that XML takes so much space and is harder to parse because you have to close tags.  Also, to manipulate XML you&#8217;d have to do things like finding a node &#8220;species&#8221; and then accessing its inner text, instead of just retrieving &#8220;species&#8221; immediately.</li></ul><br />Sources:<br /><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/overview.html">Google: Protocol Buffers Developer Guide</a><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialize">Wikipedia: Serialization</a><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/proto.html#enum">Google: Protocol Buffers Language Guide</a></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;ve got an ActionScript project which already compiles into a SWF file of 600x400.  So how do I add UI (buttons, etc.) to this?  i.e. maybe import all the existing AS code into a Flex Project so I can use the fancy UI components?<br /><br />I near-immediately discovered the <strong>SWFLoader</strong>, which had a relatively promising name.  It&#8217;s a control that apparently &#8220;lets you load one application into another application.&#8221; You add the SWFLoader component, set its Source, and Flex will import the SWF file and run it.  SWFLoader can also load different types of images (jpg, png, etc.) but I think that the Image component is supposed to be better suited for that.<br /><br />Concerning design: an SWF that is loaded with an SWFLoader could be either a sub-application, or a module.  The difference is that a main application would load a sub-application, instead of embedding their functionality, which would mean a smaller initial download size and shorter load time for the main application.  This also means that you have better encapsulation of the functionality.<br /><br />In an application that is modular, the main application would load each form as a module using the <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/mx/modules/ModuleManager.html">ModuleManager</a>, which maps URLs to modules, and dispatches events to communicate whether a module is in a loaded state or a not-yet-loaded state.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Loading a SWF file with SWFLoader</strong><br />So when I try putting the source of my SWFLoader as my other SWF file, I get some weird &#8220;Error #2032,&#8221; like this:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TR1jdV0LkEI/AAAAAAAAACk/nLyrh6xlNUA/s1600/fb_swfloader.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="201" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TR1jdV0LkEI/AAAAAAAAACk/nLyrh6xlNUA/s320/fb_swfloader.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">why. &nbsp;why are you there</td></tr></tbody></table><br />But when I actually tried running, the embedded SWF showed up, so.  Not sure what&#8217;s going on there.  It seems that this is supposed to occur when the object is not found or null, but when I followed the link, I found the right (working) SWF&#8230;so. -shrug- Maybe it&#8217;s because my filepath contains spaces?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Making a Flex application work with an embedded SWF</strong><br />To use the variables and functions in a SWF that&#8217;s loaded in your application with a SWFLoader, you need to make sure of these things:<br /><ul><li>import <code>mx.managers.SystemManager</code></li><li>Make an instance of a SystemManager, i.e. something like <code>public var loadedSM:SystemManager</code></li><li>Make sure the SystemManger instance gets binded to the properties of the embedded SWF with an intializer function that contains a line like <code>loadedSM = SystemManager(<em>SWFLoaderID</em>.content)</code></li><li>Make sure that the <code>&lt;mx:SWFLoader&gt;</code> contains a <code>complete</code> property that will call the function that initializes the SystemManager</li></ul><br />That being said, here&#8217;s a sample for a simple &#8220;application&#8221; (such a big word for such a silly thing), where clicking on the button changes the text in the Label component:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

Even so, when I clicked the button on the outer application, I would see the inner application function&#8217;s alert before I saw the &#8220;test alert&#8221; message.  More to think about later, I guess.<br /><br />(Incidentally, that last bit also shows an example of how to call a function from the SWF loaded in an SWFLoader.)<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">Update</span><br />So I guess there&#8217;s a much easier way to interact with a SWF inside a SWFLoader, and it goes like this:<br /><br /><ul><li>Give your SWFLoader an id, like <code>loaderID</code></li><li>Interact with it by using <code>loaderID.content</code></li></ul><br />So, to call a function, you could write something like <code>loaderID.content["function"](args)</code>.<br /><br /><span class="shh">Huh.</span><br /><br />Sources:<br /><a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf619ab-7ff0.html">Adobe: Loading applications with the SWFLoader control</a><br /><a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7f0b.html">Adobe: Creating and loading sub-applications</a><br /><a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7f9c.html">Adobe: SWFLoader control</a><br /><a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7eec.html">Adobe: Listening for mouse events with loaded applications</a><br /><a href="http://www.bigresource.com/FLASH-SWFLoader-ioError-file-name--0q7ZSQf3Q7.html">BigResource thing</a><br /><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1091342/interact-with-swf-loader">Stackoverflow: Interact with SWF Loader</a></div>

So the reason why I was doing <a href="http://neaurobi.blogspot.com/2010/12/notes-from-me-trying-to-learn-flex.html">all that stuff earlier</a> was because I have to work on adding UI to an ActionScript 3.0 project in Flash Builder.<br /><br />But apparently ActionScript projects are made using the Flash API, whereas Flex projects are used with the Flex framework.  This means that you can&#8217;t use Flex UI components with ActionScript projects.<br /><br /><span class="shh">Shoot.</span><br /><br />So I wonder how can you have UI element like buttons and such in an ActionScript project?  Is it impossible?  Is it possible to import the ActionScript code into a Flex project?  The issue is that the program I have presently compiles into a SWF of such-and-such given height, and I don&#8217;t know how that SWF gets defined so you would be able to arrange it around.  For instance, in a Flex project you could use the Design tab to fit stuff together, but I assume that it wouldn&#8217;t know the size of a 600x400 coded something until it&#8217;s compiled, and wouldn&#8217;t know where to place it either.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Edit</strong><br />Okay, so here&#8217;s something else I found <a href="http://www.actionscript.org/forums/showthread.php3?t=119594">somewhere</a> while searching:<br /><br /><blockquote>There is not support for using the Flex Framework in an AS only project. While it is theoretically possible, you would have to manually bootstrap a lot of the application initialization code that Flex handles (something which would be rather complex).<br /><br />If you want to play with the framework, but don&#8217;t want to layout your app with mxml, then the easier way is to create a simple mxml file that contains an application tag, and a script tag that then points to your code.<br /><br />This way, the application tag will take care of all of the initialization, and you can then leverage the framework via ActionScript.</blockquote><br />SO I GUESS IT&#8217;S BETTER TO AVOID USING FLEX COMPONENTS IN AN ACTIONSCRIPT-ONLY PROJECT.<br /><br />Which kind of begs the question, what&#8217;s the difference between Flex and Flash anyway?  I mean, I guess I&#8217;ve kind of been running around in general because I still don&#8217;t quite get the difference between Flex and Flash and Flash Player and MXML and ActionScript and what, even Adobe Air.<br /><br />So!  Let&#8217;s have definitions:<br /><br /><strong>Application/Application software</strong>: software designed to help a user perform task(s), i.e. writing papers, drawing stuff, listening to music.<br /><br /><strong>Web application</strong>: an application that&#8217;s accessed over a network like The Internets.  It can also refer to an application that&#8217;s coded in a browser-supported language, like something that&#8217;s a mix of JavaScript and HTML.  These are good because web applications can be updated and maintained without distributing and installing software.  Examples of web apps: e-mail, online retail sales, wikis.<br /><br /><strong>Desktop application</strong>: I assume that an application is a desktop application unless it&#8217;s explicitly stated to be a web application?  So like, a desktop application for listening to music would be iTunes, but a web application for listening to music would be&#8230;like&#8230;Pandora.<br /><br /><strong>Software framework</strong> is an application skeleton where the application has already defined parts that are the most important &#8211; i.e. a software framework for a bank would already have withdraw/deposit methods coded up.  They&#8217;re a special case of software libraries in that they&#8217;re re-usable and have other special features, i.e. inversion of control, which is when the framework dictates the flow of control, and not the caller.  Frameworks can also be extended/added to, but not modified.<br /><br /><strong>Rich Internet Application (RIA)</strong>: &#8220;A web application that has many of the characteristics of desktop applications,&#8221; which are delivered by way of a browser or browser plug-in, of a sandbox, or a virtual machine.  A user would have to install a software framework before using the RIA, and the framework would download, update, verify, and execute the RIA.  The three most common platforms for RIAs are Adobe Flash, Java, and Microsoft Silverlight.  <br /><br /><strong>Runtime environment:</strong> software that supports the execution of computer programs.  So, you can&#8217;t run a Java program if you don&#8217;t have a Java Runetime Enfironment (JRE).<br /><br /><strong>Flash Player</strong>: a runtime environment that runs Flash-platform content and applications.  Flash Player is used for viewing animations and movies using a web browser.  It runs SWF files, which can be embedded in websites.  It was originally meant to display 2D vector animations (the likes of which you can build in Adobe Flash), but since then has been also used for making RIAs, and streaming video and audio.  And games, and GUI.<br /><br /><strong>Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR)</strong>: a runtime environment for building RIAs with Adobe Flash, Adobe Flex, HTML, or Ajax, which can be deployed as desktop applications.  So, for a user to use an application executed in Adobe AIR, Adobe AIR must be installed onto the user&#8217;s computer at operating-system level.  (On a side-note, I noticed Adobe AIR being installed on my computer while installing Rosetta Stone&#8230;I guess that&#8217;s why.)<br /><br /><strong>Flash</strong>: Refers to Adobe Flash (the program), and the Flash Player.  Adobe Flash makes flash files, which Flash Player runs.<br /><br /><strong>Adobe Flex</strong>: an SDK released so as to develop/deploy RIAs based on Adobe Flash.  Flex applications can be written using Adobe Flash Builder (which you have to give moneys for), or just by using a text editor/Eclipse and a Flex compiler.  Flex applications are made using MXML and ActionScript.  It&#8217;s meant for creating RIAs, and provides a lot of useful things, like pretty-looking UI components (buttons, color pickers, grids).  Adobe Flex also outputs an SWF file.<br /><br /><strong>ActionScript (3.0)</strong>: an object-oriented language used for developing websites and software.  It outputs into an SWF file, which is then embedded into a website and run by Adobe Flash Player.  It was initially meant to control the 2D vector animations made in Adobe Flash.<br /><br /><strong>MXML</strong>: used in combination with ActionScript to create RIAs.  Flex uses MXML for the layout of the application, and ActionScript for the programming logic.  MXML is eventually compiled into ActionScript.  Adobe Flash Builder can compile MXML into a SWF file.<br /><br /><strong>SWF file</strong>: the output of compiling ActionScript.  SWF files can be used by Adobe Flash Player (for the web) and Adobe AIR (for the desktop).<br /><br /><br />I think the reason for all of my confusion was that &#8220;Flash&#8221; is apparently used for both Adobe Flash Player, the runtime, as well as Adobe Flash, the authoring environment, as well as like, &#8220;Flash games,&#8221; which kind of makes you think of some game that&#8217;s made &#8220;in Flash,&#8221; when really it&#8217;s written in ActionScript, and compiled to an SWF that is run by Flash Player.  And when people compare Flash and Flex on the internets, what they&#8217;re really comparing is Adobe Flash and Adobe Flash Builder, probably, not a set of two different languages.<br /><br />I&#8217;m such a noob &gt;____&gt;<br /><br />So maybe it&#8217;s still possible to use all of the ActionScript in the present project by just importing it into a Flex project and hooking up all the buttons?<br /><br />NEEDS MOAR SEARCHING.<br /><br /><br />Sources:<br /><a href="http://theresidentalien.typepad.com/ginormous/2009/02/the-difference-between-flex-and-flash.html">Ginormous: The Difference Between Flex and Flash</a><br />Some stackoverflow questions: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/148747/what-is-the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library">1</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2572109/whats-the-practical-definition-of-software-programming-framework">2</a><br />Essential ActionScript 3.0, O&#8217;Reilly Media<br />various Wikipedia articles</div>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRmnXZ3Yu1I/AAAAAAAAABs/exbK6RHqHx8/s1600/Flexicon.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRmnXZ3Yu1I/AAAAAAAAABs/exbK6RHqHx8/s200/Flexicon.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Though both Kelly and Nandrew made faces when I said I was trying to learn this</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><strong>In General:</strong><br />Flex applications are comprised of MXML and ActionScript.  MXML/Flex is used for the application interface, and ActionScript is used for the programming logic.  Compiling a project yields a SWF file, which is referenced in an HTML page. When someone looks at the page, the SWF file is downloaded and rendered by Flash Player.<br /><br />When you create a Flex Project in Flash Builder, you&#8217;ll automatically get an MXML file with the same name as the new project.<br /><br />This is the initial code you get in that MXML file:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;<br /><s:application minheight="600" minwidth="955" xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009" xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx" xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"><br /> <fx:declarations><br />      (non-visual elements like services, value objects are placed here)<br /> </fx:declarations><br /></s:application><br /></pre><br /><code>&lt;s:Application&gt;</code> defines the container for the application; it&#8217;s the root tag in the XML document.<br /><br /><br /><strong>MXML and UI</strong><br />MXML defines what components are in the UI &#8211; Buttons, CheckBoxes, DataGrids (which show lists), etc.  When you look at the MXML file in Flash Builder, two tabs will appear, which will allow you to alter the layout of the application.  You can use the Design tab (when you look at your .mxml file) to add buttons, etc. from the Components bar in the bottom-left, or you can write it buttons manually into the Source with tags that look like <code>&lt;s:Button&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;mx:DataGrid&gt;</code>, etc&#8230;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRmdzLInguI/AAAAAAAAABo/aYhA373OJ-g/s1600/flexui.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="172" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRmdzLInguI/AAAAAAAAABo/aYhA373OJ-g/s320/flexui.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">buttons and stuff, yeeeeh</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Buttons and whatever you make in the Design tab get converted into MXML.  So, looking at the Source tab, this code was generated from my lolsy layout above:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;<br /><s:application minheight="600" minwidth="955" xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009" xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx" xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"><br /> <fx:declarations><br /><br /> </fx:declarations><br /> <mx:colorpicker x="176" y="119"><br /> <s:button label="button!!" x="284" y="107"><br /> <mx:datagrid x="176" y="160"><br />  <mx:columns><br />   <mx:datagridcolumn datafield="col1" headertext="GET"><br />   <mx:datagridcolumn datafield="col4" headertext="AT"><br />   <mx:datagridcolumn datafield="col2" headertext="MY"><br />   <mx:datagridcolumn datafield="col3" headertext="DATA"><br />  </mx:datagridcolumn></mx:datagridcolumn></mx:datagridcolumn></mx:datagridcolumn></mx:columns><br /> </mx:datagrid><br /> <s:hslider x="170" y="67"><br /> <s:panel height="200" width="250" x="493" y="57"><br /> </s:panel><br /></s:hslider></s:button></mx:colorpicker></s:application><br /></pre><br />It doesn&#8217;t matter what order the components are in within the MXML file because their positions are determined by the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> attributes.  Other styles can be set this way, like colors &#8211; you can view all of them by clicking inside a tag and pressing CTRL+space.  Alternatively, all the styles can be done by CSS.<br /><br />You can get even more information about the components by clicking Help &gt; Dynamic Help and clicking on whatever component you want.<br /><br />Now you can click on the green arrow and run stuff!  Actually, the first time I tried to run I pressed the small arrow to the right and selected <em>HelloFlex</em>, the name of my test project, and the browser was blank, though you could right-click and it would say <em>About Adobe Flash Player 10</em>, etc&#8230;but it turned out that I just hadn&#8217;t built the workspace, so&#8230;<br /><br />.____.<br /><br />So anyway now everything is in the browser and it&#8217;s clickable!  And also movable and stuff.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRrX3VeaAcI/AAAAAAAAAB0/NE2-8Z9r1a0/s1600/fb4_web.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRrX3VeaAcI/AAAAAAAAAB0/NE2-8Z9r1a0/s320/fb4_web.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">LET&#8217;S GO CRAAAAZY</td></tr></tbody></table><br />But nothing happens yet.<br /><br /><br /><strong>MX and Spark Components</strong><br />If you take a closer look at the tags for the components added, you&#8217;ll notice that their namespaces are different &#8211; for instance, the Datagrid tag <code>&lt;mx:DataGrid&gt;</code> has a namespace of <code>mx</code>, whereas the button tag <code>&lt;s:Button&gt;</code> has a namespace of <code>s</code>.<br /><br />This is due to the fact that Flex 4 introduced a new set of components called Spark components, and uses them along with the older components, called MX Components.  Some advantages of the Spark components are that they&#8217;re easy to custom skin.  In general, Flex 4 lets you choose which components you want to use, and you can mix and match, though use Spark components when you can.<br /><br />I found more about Spark components and general Flex 4 stuff <a href="http://insideria.com/2009/06/overview-of-flex-4-gumbo.html">here</a>.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Making the Button Do Something</strong><br />To make the button do something, you&#8217;ll need to take advantage of the fact that buttons emit &#8220;click events&#8221; whenever someone presses them.  Change the <code>&lt;s:Button</code> tag to include a property <code>click="button1_clickHandler(event)"</code>.  Flash Builder should fill in that function name as a default, and also add brand new code right beneath the <code>&lt;s:Application&gt;</code> root node, which looks like this:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: xml"><fx:script><br /> &lt;![CDATA[<br />  protected function button1_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void<br />  {<br />   // TODO Auto-generated method stub<br />  }<br /> ]]&gt; <br /></fx:script><br /></pre><br />You can make a pop-up show when someone clicks the button by replacing the commented-out code with <code>Alert.show("LLAMAS")</code>.  Flash Builder should automatically import <code>mx.controls.Alert</code> before the function definition, so that the code should now look something like <br /><br /><pre class="brush: xml"><fx:script><br /> &lt;![CDATA[<br />  import mx.controls.Alert;<br />  protected function button1_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void<br />  {<br />   Alert.show("LLAMAS");<br />  }<br /> ]]&gt;<br /></fx:script><br /><br /></pre><br />Then you can (build and) run and click the button to your heart&#8217;s content.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRrYEOUmO2I/AAAAAAAAAB4/KdU4LJunEG8/s1600/fb4_buttonalert.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="198" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRrYEOUmO2I/AAAAAAAAAB4/KdU4LJunEG8/s320/fb4_buttonalert.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">WE TOTALLY GOT THIS BRO</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><strong>Creating Application States</strong><br />In a website, you make different files for the different pages that you visit, but an application instead has states.  You can create them by going back to that <strong>Design</strong> tab, then looking for the new <strong>States</strong> window and right-clicking to create a State.<br /><br />For the second state, I put in two new components &#8211; an Image and a Label &#8211; and altered them accordingly with the Properties bar on the right-hand side.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRrYOr7ITFI/AAAAAAAAAB8/-WFUft_YIVM/s1600/fb4_imgcomp.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="136" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRrYOr7ITFI/AAAAAAAAAB8/-WFUft_YIVM/s320/fb4_imgcomp.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Fiddling around in Design added new stuff to the source.  This is the entire thing now:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;<br /><s:application minheight="600" minwidth="955" xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009" xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx" xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"><br /> <s:states><br />  <s:state name="State1"><br />  <s:state name="State2"><br /> </s:state></s:state><br /> </s:states><br /> <fx:declarations><br />  <br /> </fx:declarations><br /> <mx:colorpicker includein="State1" x="176" y="119"><br /> <s:button includein="State1" label="button!!" x="284" y="107"><br /> <mx:datagrid includein="State1" x="176" y="160"><br />  <mx:columns><br />   <mx:datagridcolumn datafield="col1" headertext="GET"><br />   <mx:datagridcolumn datafield="col4" headertext="AT"><br />   <mx:datagridcolumn datafield="col2" headertext="MY"><br />   <mx:datagridcolumn datafield="col3" headertext="DATA"><br />  </mx:datagridcolumn></mx:datagridcolumn></mx:datagridcolumn></mx:datagridcolumn></mx:columns><br /> </mx:datagrid><br /> <s:hslider includein="State1" x="170" y="67"><br /> <s:panel height="200" includein="State1" width="250" x="493" y="57"><br /> </s:panel><br /> <mx:image height="214" includein="State2" source="file:/C:/Users/nadine/Desktop/llamas.jpg" width="318" x="181" y="61"><br /> <s:label includein="State2" text="Our healing sweets animal" x="291" y="283"><br /></s:label></mx:image></s:hslider></s:button></mx:colorpicker></s:application><br /></pre><br />There are two main changes.  The first is this, right after the <code>&lt;s:Application&gt;</code> root tag:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: xml"><s:states><br /> <s:state name="State1"><br /> <s:state name="State2"><br /></s:state></s:state></s:states><br /></pre><br /><code>states</code> is basically an array of all the <code>State</code> objects that you have in the application.<br /><br />How does the application know which components belong to which state?  The <code>includeIn</code> property is attached to some of the components now, which show the only state for which it should be displayed.  Here are the MXML tags for the new Image and Label components that I added.<br /><br /><pre class="brush: xml"><mx:image height="214" includein="State2" source="file:/C:/Users/nadine/Desktop/llamas.jpg" width="318" x="181" y="61"><br /><s:label includein="State2" text="Our healing sweets animal" x="291" y="283"><br /></s:label></mx:image></pre><br /><br /><strong>Switching Between Application States</strong><br />You can switch between application states by setting <code>currentState</code> to something, like <code>currentState = state2</code>.  Placing this in the code for the click event of the button like this:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:js">protected function button1_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void<br /> {<br />  Alert.show("LLAMAS");<br />  currentState = "State2";<br /> }<br /></pre><br />Will make it so that clicking the button labeled &#8220;button!!&#8221; will bring you to the page with the llama Image.  Though there&#8217;s no way to get back to the first state, for now&#8230;<br /><br />In conclusion, here is all the code for this:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;<br /><s:application minheight="600" minwidth="955" xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009" xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx" xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"><br /><br /> <fx:script><br />  &lt;![CDATA[<br />   import mx.controls.Alert;<br />   protected function button1_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void<br />   {<br />    Alert.show("LLAMAS");<br />    currentState = "State2";<br />   }<br />  ]]&gt;<br /> </fx:script><br /><br /> <s:states><br />  <s:state name="State1"><br />  <s:state name="State2"><br /> </s:state></s:state></s:states><br /> <fx:declarations><br />  <br /> </fx:declarations><br /> <mx:colorpicker includein="State1" x="176" y="119"><br /> <s:button click="button1_clickHandler(event)" includein="State1" label="button!!" x="284" y="107"><br /> <mx:datagrid includein="State1" x="176" y="160"><br />  <mx:columns><br />   <mx:datagridcolumn datafield="col1" headertext="GET"><br />   <mx:datagridcolumn datafield="col4" headertext="AT"><br />   <mx:datagridcolumn datafield="col2" headertext="MY"><br />   <mx:datagridcolumn datafield="col3" headertext="DATA"><br />  </mx:datagridcolumn></mx:datagridcolumn></mx:datagridcolumn></mx:datagridcolumn></mx:columns><br /> </mx:datagrid><br /> <s:hslider includein="State1" x="170" y="67"><br /> <s:panel height="200" includein="State1" width="250" x="493" y="57"><br /> </s:panel><br /> <mx:image height="214" includein="State2" source="file:/C:/Users/nadine/Desktop/llamas.jpg" width="318" x="181" y="61"><br /> <s:label includein="State2" text="Our healing sweets animal" x="291" y="283"><br /></s:label></mx:image></s:hslider></s:button></mx:colorpicker></s:application><br /></pre>Things got a little strange after I messed around with the columns of the DataGrid in runtime&#8230;but everything&#8217;s essentially there.<br /><br /><br />Sources:<br /><a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/testdrive/articles/1_build_a_flex_app.html">Adobe: Flex Test Drive Page 1</a><br /><a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/testdrive/articles/1_build_a_flex_app3.html">Adobe: Flex Test Drive Page 3</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhrUWbSSLT4">Using button controls in Flash Builder 4 and Flex 4 Essential Training (video)</a><br /><a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/using_states_4.html">Adobe Docs: Using View States</a></div>
