I've always been more of a cat person, but recently I've been mad for shiba inu.  I found one in the FarmVille suite and it made my day.  I'm too shy to visit him all the time, but it's enough to see him now and again.<br /><br />I found another shiba at the company meeting, and, typical of shiba aloofness with strangers, he did not care in the slightest that I adored him.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-74D_Hl1tbpk/Ti-wzOFiDcI/AAAAAAAAAUE/ZcMr3K-nsoc/s1600/DSC_0119%2B%25282%2529.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-74D_Hl1tbpk/Ti-wzOFiDcI/AAAAAAAAAUE/ZcMr3K-nsoc/s640/DSC_0119%2B%25282%2529.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh whoa i found a stick lol nom nom nom</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I cannot really explain why I started loving shiba inu with the abruptness and ferocity with which I did despite my general ":|" feeling about dogs, but it probably has something to do with this video, at least initially:<br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_uIshkpeXko" width="425"></iframe></center><br /><br />(More videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL957844FC81969564&amp;feature=mh_lolz">here</a>!)<br /><br />During breaks at work I've been searching for shiba inu-related stuff to read, and found <a href="http://juicybits.com/Shosha/_history.php">History and Tradition of the Japanese Shiba-Inu by Julia Cadwell</a>.  It goes,<br /><br /><blockquote>Today’s Shiba has been bred by careful mixing of many strains of small Japanese dogs.</blockquote><br />And then,<br /><br /><blockquote>The first impression the Japanese Shiba Dog creates is a lack of sophistication—a touch of nature that has escaped human forced breeding. Actually the Japanese Shiba Dog has escaped much artificiality that accompanies improvement and fixation of species.</blockquote><br /><em>lol wat</em><br /><br />In other news, this idea of shiba inu being attractive because they are in part so wild and "not completely obedient" reminds me intensely of tea ceremony aestheticism, of the beauty it finds in odd numbers, in asymmetrical and lumpy pottery, in things that are perfect because of their imperfection.<br /><br />Finding a job and then finding a shibanakama are some of the reasons why I am excited to return home. :3</div>
