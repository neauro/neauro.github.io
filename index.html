  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always said before that I was busy with school but it doesn&rsquo;t compare at all to the amount of work I have now, just a couple weeks until graduation. AAAAHHH</p>

<p>Lots has been happening. Even so, I&rsquo;ve been posting pretty frequently on <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> (as it requires less effort and being able to arrange photos nicely is fun).</p>

<p>In particular I&rsquo;ve been working on my Capstone project, Bubble, an app to faciliate easier sharing of photos and messages between iPhone users using mesh networking (the same kind that <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/525921/the-latest-chat-app-for-iphone-needs-no-internet-connection/">Firechat</a> has been making use of). I&rsquo;ve been writing about my team&rsquo;s progress in our own <a href="http://hcdeevee.tumblr.com/">process blog</a>, and I&rsquo;ve also posted <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/code-eevee">in-progress stuff</a> about my own sketches and experiments with Sketch 3 and Flinto. Sketch 3 is fantastic, and I find myself opening it even when I just need to do a couple quick photo edits. Flinto is also great, though I&rsquo;m disappointed that I&rsquo;ll probably never &ldquo;really&rdquo; use it after my trial runs out, because $20 a month is a little much for someone who just wants to play with flows that I won&rsquo;t get paid for. I wish there was a way to pay up front and only have one active project or something. As it is, I&rsquo;m keeping an eye on <a href="http://proto.io/">Proto.io</a> and <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel App</a> for future playing. (Though I still loove <a href="https://popapp.in/">Pop App</a> right now for interactive paper prototyping.)</p>

<p>Other than capstone work, I&rsquo;ve also been working on a lot of fun design projects for my Interaction Design class this quarter, which I&rsquo;ll post about separately later.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been writing a ton! A month ago the &ldquo;Plague&rdquo; theme edition of <a href="http://strayingfromreality.wordpress.com/">AU</a> was released, which had my story <em>Iron &amp; Honey</em>. It&rsquo;s available currently at Bulldog News.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/ironandhoney.jpg" alt="The first page of 'Iron and Honey'"/></p>

<p class="caption">The first page of <em>Iron &amp; Honey</em></p>


<p>I&rsquo;ve also been working on my Big Story with greater headway than I have before by using the &ldquo;writing scene-by-scene&rdquo; technique which I read about in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=story+robert+mckee+&oq=story+robert+mckee+&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59l4j0.2336j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8"><em>Story</em> by Robert McKee</a>. The way that I’m executing is by writing out each scene with a “beginning state” of certain characters, their “ending” state, and the exposition or other “feeling” work that needs to also happen.</p>

<p>My problem with Big Story is that I love my world and my characters and I know what I want to say, but I have no idea how to say it, and no idea how to get from my known point A to point B. Hopefully working out each step like this will help me actually get somewhere. I’ve had problems dragging mindlessly from A to B with all my previous iterations, but with this kind of technique I can already feel myself becoming more conscious of how to make making meaningful things happen the whole way through.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/writing-progress.png" alt="Screenshot of a Google Doc"/></p>

<p class="caption">yay! things happening!</p>


<p>The final major happening in my life is the release of <a href="http://supergiantgames.com/index.php/transistor/">Transistor</a>! (≧▽≦ I spent the Monday prior its release this week listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KudXO0DO04U&feature=youtu.be&t=5m42s">We All Become</a> on repeat, more of a fangirl about this than any other game than I can think of. I&rsquo;m about 4 hours in and have already had a heart-swelling experience that reduced me into a puddle of sap. I&rsquo;m not done yet but I love it I love it and it&rsquo;s incredibly inspiring. I can only hope the good feels stay until the end.</p>

<time datetime="2014-02-26T15:11:18-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 26<span>th</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I was investigating different Javascript libraries for blurring things on mobile. In this case, blurring would act to obscure an image from the user.</p>

<h3><a href="http://blurjs.com/?bg=1">Blur.js</a></h3>


<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s easy; plug and play. It also supports draggable elements (<a href="http://blurjs.com/simpledemo.html">and has a neat demo proving it</a>)</li>
<li>You can specify your overlay color and blur radius, and it even supports caching.</li>
<li>More hackproof; since (on first glance) it seems to replace your original image entirely, you can&#8217;t easily unblur it using developer tools.</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>When I used this library for a div with a background-image, the entire image wasn&#8217;t blurred out; only part of it. It didn&#8217;t play nicely with my background-image having a <code>background-size:cover</code> style.</li>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t seem to work for blurring text or colored divs; just elements with some image aspect.</li>
<li>You need to provide a &#8220;source&#8221; of blurring for some reason.</li>
</ul>




<h3><a href="http://nbartlomiej.github.io/foggy/">Foggy</a></h3>


<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses the CSS &#8220;filter&#8221; and falls back to a &#8220;manual blur&#8221; if the browser doesn&#8217;t support it.</li>
<li><em>Really</em> simple; at the most basic level, all you need is <code>$(".selector").foggy()</code></li>
<li>It worked on mobile Safari! (And I haven&#8217;t yet tested it with anything else.)</li>
<li>You can also unblur blurred objects!</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The manual blur creates duplicates of elements, so it could be pretty expensive? Especially for a mobile web app, my specific use case. (In my brief tests, I didn&#8217;t notice any particular behavior downgrade.)</li>
<li>You could &#8220;hack&#8221; this by inspecting elements to see what the original image is.</li>
</ul>


<p>I ended up using Foggy so that I could grab multiple elements with one selector to blur (rather than needing to iterate through each and supply each one with its own &ldquo;source&rdquo;). Also, &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; via a developer tool is less of a risk. and, honestly, it just worked more quickly, though I do love the layout of Blur&rsquo;s page better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/animango/noragami.jpg" alt="Cover of volume 10 of Noragami, showing its three main protagonists"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14290364-champion">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>At the boundary between this realm and another, there live eight million gods, dead spirits who serve the gods, and other assorted spirits who help and meddle in the affairs of humans. A sweet middle school girl named Mutsumi has been enduring bullying from her classmates, and she goes to the restroom by herself to cry. Scrawled on the bathroom wall is a phone number and the message, &#8220;I will solve your troubles.&#8221;
<br/><br/>

After Mutsumi calls the number, she encounters a homeless, unemployed figure who proclaims himself a &#8220;god.&#8221; Crude, unpredictable, and worthless, he does not answer people&#8217;s prayers and no one acknowledges him. However, he has one sole power, the ability to cut all who pass between this world and the next. (<a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=56588">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>The previous manga description is strange because the character &ldquo;Mutsumi&rdquo; only appears in the first chapter&hellip;but, eh.</p>

<p>Noragami, the first story both written and illustrated by the ADACHI Toka team, <em>is my new favorite manga</em>.</p>

<p>The basic elements of the story are Shinto-style gods; their &ldquo;shinki,&rdquo; who are spirits of deceased humans who can take on the form of weaponry/animals/etc.; and &ldquo;ayakashi,&rdquo; or phantoms, the Bad Animal Things that exist invisibly in the world of humans. The main protagonists are Yato, a &ldquo;stray god&rdquo; without a shrine; Hiyori, a high school girl who, due to a car accident, is a &ldquo;half-ayakashi&rdquo; capable of astral projection; and Yukine, Yato&rsquo;s shinki, who can take the form of a sword. The story starts with Yato&rsquo;s desire to obtain a shrine for his own and delves into the ideas of what it means to trust humans and what it means to live to obtain (or be the source of) happiness.</p>

<p>[mild spoilers ahead]</p>

<p>Reasons why you should read it:</p>

<ul>
<li>The character development is incredible. Even characters like Yukine, who seemed poised to be ultra-generic gruff teenage shounen, grows into a kind of character I rarely see amongst teenage boys: both jealous and compassionate when it comes to people he cares about, easily hurt and full of pride and determination.</li>
<li>Though it starts with a lot of characters explaining painfully exact and detailed world-building to each other, the story continues on to fleshes out every aspect and angle of what you&#8217;re told about. We start with a single god having a single shinki (Yato and Yukine), and then explore what it means for a god to have multiple shinki (as in the case of Vaisravana and her family), and what it means for a shinki to have multiple gods (as in the case of &#8220;Nora&#8221;). Each of these aspects come with examinations of the emotions and motivations of all the characters involved. <em>Ahhh it&#8217;s so good</em></li>
<li>After the first big infodump, the story also introduces &#8220;new ideas&#8221; very smoothly. When the idea of &#8220;what happens when a god dies&#8221; is brought in, it continues to be picked up and played with by later events. <em>Which is so fantastic.</em></li>
<li>The art is beautiful! It has more of a &#8220;realistic&#8221; feel, like <em>Death Note</em>, and the characters are visually varied. <em>The characters are actually varied.</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hiyori isn&#8217;t terribly interesting yet; she&#8217;s struggled with wanting to maintain her relationship with Yato, but otherwise doesn&#8217;t seem to have any personal problems to overcome, which is unfortunate. Whereas Yato and Yukine both have had their share of personal obstacles, Hiyori seems to be taking a &#8220;Fruits Basket Tohru-like&#8221; role in being &#8220;the one that supports everyone (almost) unconditionally.&#8221; Still, she does call out other characters on their toxic behavior, takes none of that behavior herself, and has cool heroic moments where she saves both Yato and Yukine from their various problems (and <em>not</em> just by encouraging them to talk it out or merely offering phrases like &#8220;I believe in you!&#8221;&#8230;though those happen too).</li>
<li>Still, I have a lot of faith in this manga and I&#8217;m looking forward to Hiyori getting more development in the future.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/smallworld1.jpg" alt="Picture of Smallworld board, with 'Dragon Master Elves' at the front"/></p>

<p class="caption">dragon master elves?!</p>


<p>Last Friday we hit up a small pub table and inconspicuously played J&rsquo;s copy of Small World, <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/">&ldquo;the fun, zany, light-hearted civilization board game!&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote>Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci™, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs and even humans; who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth. (<a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>This game has some disturbing colonialization themes aside; there are even pre-existing people in some territorites that you must conquer to inhabit that territory. Even so, I enjoyed this game so much that I eyed it hungrily at Card Kingdom after our party dispersed. The delicious flavor! The cool (albeit almost entirely white) characters! I love that the game naturally becomes different each time as you mix &ldquo;race powers&rdquo; and &ldquo;special powers;&rdquo; I love that the flavor of the game itself, its pictures and words, are delicious and meaningful and fly off the cardboard and became us — as in the terrifying era of K&rsquo;s Pillaging Skeletons, uprooting their femurs from mountain and farmland and laying waste across nests of Flying Trolls and Berserk Humans, resting for only a moment before rising again in greater number. <em>What</em>.</p>

<p>One weak part of the game, however, are the victory points. They are called gold; if you have the most of them at the end of the game, You Win. Flavor-wise, I don&rsquo;t feel like they entirely fit — when, during all this conquest, does gold arbitrary rise from the depths? — and there&rsquo;s also not much that you can do with them, other than occasionally exchange them to get the race you want. During the &ldquo;conquest&rdquo; phase, they are useless. What if instead you could use them to do something like increase your number of troops, and gamble to try and get more land? What if you needed to pay coins in order to roll for reinforcement, an action that is otherwise totally free and something you usually want to do? It seems like a missed opportunity for <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2010/03/flydrill-and-logistical-gameplay.html">logistical gameplay</a>, and allowing players the pleasure of &ldquo;not simply doing something, but doing it well — optimizing it to perfection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A also noted that, though he felt he had made the right &ldquo;decisions,&rdquo; he still placed last in our group of four, and didn&rsquo;t grasp how he could have played the game better. He didn&rsquo;t feel that he had &ldquo;gained experience&rdquo; and learned how to play the game any better. Though I can&rsquo;t find it now, it reminds me of what I have read once regarding <a href="http://spryfox.com/our-games/tripletown/">Triple Town</a>, and how it seems to be a simple game until you make a mistake — <em>and then you get it</em>, you get what the game is about, you feel excited to give it another go.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/smallworld2.jpg" alt="Picture of Smallworld board, with a ton of stuff on it"/></p>

<p class="caption">smallworld board, getting all exciting as stuff accumulates</p>


<p>I hope to try out the expansions sometime, though the use of &ldquo;gypsy&rdquo; as a race in one of them is disconcerting, and reminds me of how uncomfortable the overall theme is.</p>

<p>This past week I attended <a href="http://www.conveyux.com/">ConveyUX</a>, a now two-year-old UX conference presented by <a href="http://www.blinkux.com/">Blink</a>. I also attended last year, and was impressed by the growth that this conference has had since then. There were over twice the number of attendees, and everyone was incredibly friendly. Don Norman was the keynote speaker and I got him to sign my copy of <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>!</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/doet.jpg" alt="The inside cover of Design of Everyday Things, and signature of its author, Don Norman"/></p>

<p class="caption">yess!</p>


<p>I took a lot of notes — not so much to help me remember stuff later (though notes are helpful for that purpose), but because it helps keep my mind from wandering, and helps ideas stick more tightly.</p>

<p>The following are some of the interesting ideas I came away with from the talks I attended.</p>

<h2>Day 1 Talks</h2>


<h3>Keynote, Don Norman</h3>


<ul>
<li>UX is not about websites, it&#8217;s about life.</li>
<li>Putting a picture of a button on a screen does not &#8220;afford&#8221; touching; it &#8220;signifies&#8221; that the user should touch</li>
<li>Designers pride themselves on answering the right question, and not on solving the exact problem they&#8217;re trying to solve</li>
<li>(Don) Norman&#8217;s Law: the day the product team is assembled, it&#8217;s over budget and behind schedule. (lolz)</li>
<li>The most powerful questions are stupid: question fundamentals and change the world</li>
<li>For people struggling with managers, remember: who are your users? It&#8217;s not the customers. It&#8217;s the people who are using you, your employers</li>
<li>&#8220;Marketing was absolutely right to put a button on the radio that was labeled &#8216;better sound,&#8217; because otherwise people wouldn&#8217;t know it was there.&#8221;</li>
</ul>




<h3>Beyond Usable: Mapping Emotion to Experience, Kelly Goto</h3>


<ul>
<li><em>youyuu</em>: a Japanese idea related to &#8220;enjoying the time that you have between events;&#8221; for this, you arrive early and cherish the extra time you have</li>
<li>&#8220;All our fields are moving so fast that we have no <em>youyuu</em></li>
<li>It&#8217;s powerful to be present</li>
<li>Kano surveys: you&#8217;re not impressed by a cup that doesn&#8217;t leak, but &#8220;not leaking&#8221; is necessary to function</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansei_engineering">Kansei engineering</a>: aims the development or improvement of products and services by translating customer&#8217;s psychological feelings and needs into product design</li>
<li>Keep drilling down into user&#8217;s experiences. Why why why do they enjoy something? What are the &#8220;kansei&#8221; words?</li>
<li><a href="https://dscout.com/">Dscout</a>: see what people are doing on a daily basis</li>
<li>Kaizen: continuous improvement — everyday — with everyone — everywhere.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Right Experience, Right People, Phillip Hunter</h3>


<ul>
<li>&#8220;Have you ever been to a restaurant that was just fine, but you&#8217;d never go back?&#8221;</li>
<li>UX for &#8220;real people&#8221; is going to the dentist</li>
<li>Google &#8220;mad at my phone&#8221; — there are millions of hits</li>
<li>&#8220;Experiential equalities must be distinguished from properties of objects&#8221; — C. I. Lewis</li>
<li>Qualia: intangible things that make up our experience. ex. our responses to color, taste, pain</li>
<li>There are no &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; words to describe experiences; for example, video games are &#8220;hard to use,&#8221; but this is makes them great games</li>
</ul>




<h3>Beyond Gamification, Catt Small</h3>


<ul>
<li>The field is constantly expanding because people are coming in and bringing their previous fields with them</li>
<li>Since 2011, more smartphones have sold than computers</li>
<li>Game players and game makers connect to each other with easter eggs</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/#q=zerg+rush">Zerg Rush!</a></li>
<li>Capitalize on emotions for memorability</li>
</ul>




<h3>Designing for Engagement, Susan Weinschenk</h3>


<ul>
<li>People do as little as possible</li>
<li>People have a maximum of 20 minutes of thinking time</li>
<li>Most mental processing is unconscious — ex. you know what a penny looks like, but wouldn&#8217;t usually know how to draw one from memory.</li>
<li>People can only deal with remembering 3 or 4 things (not 7).</li>
<li>More people stopped to see jam when there were 24 jars; but more people BOUGHT jars when there were only 6 displayed.</li>
<li>People are more motivated by fear of loss than anticipation of gain.</li>
<li>People expect technology to follow human-to-human interaction rules. Thus don&#8217;t use phrases like &#8220;book a copy of the book from the full bib page.&#8221;</li>
</ul>




<h3>How to Get People to Do Stuff, Susan Weinschenk</h3>


<ul>
<li>People&#8217;s &#8220;self stories&#8221; govern who they think they are and what they do; so if you want to get them to do something, change those self stories. On that note, words like &#8220;Be a Donor&#8221; are more effective than &#8220;Donate now!&#8221;</li>
<li>You can tell when someone is doing &#8220;slow&#8221; thinking — their pupils dilate.</li>
<li>People solve logical problems correctly when the problem is written in a hard-to-read font.</li>
<li>SALE ON SOUP! If &#8220;limit of 10 cans&#8221; on the sign, then people buy 7 cans on average; if &#8220;no limit&#8221; is written, people buy 3.</li>
<li>To get people to build a habit around your product, tie it into someone people already do habitually, like checking e-mail in the morning.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Day 2 Talks</h2>


<h3>Content &amp; Control, Sara Wachter-Boettcher</h3>


<ul>
<li>Content reveals a company&#8217;s values, beliefs, and baggage</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t divide people into &#8220;the website team&#8221; and &#8220;everyone else;&#8221; when you let people into the process and help design style guide rules (and such), they get invested, and will actually follow the rules they&#8217;ve made for themselves, rather than the &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; style and design guides you&#8217;ve imposed on them</li>
</ul>




<h3>What We Can Leaern From Digital Outcasts, Kel Smith</h3>


<ul>
<li>People think &#8220;accessibility isn&#8217;t innovative,&#8221; but what requires more creativity than working underneath extreme constraints? Things like Hummers and Tang have already been created under incredible constraints.</li>
<li>The typewriter was invented for a blind person who could not write</li>
<li>&#8220;The future has arrived, it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed yet.&#8221; — William Gibson</li>
<li>Competence is a spectrum, not a binary.</li>
<li>Empathy allows for you to change &#8220;unchangeable&#8221; attributes</li> 
</ul>




<h3>The Four Most Common Mistakes in Mobile/Web App Designs, Mike Mace</h3>


<ul>
<li>DON&#8217;T make text too small, older folks can&#8217;t read it</li>
<li>DON&#8217;T have low contrast; the sun will wash out words! (For that matter, test your interfaces outside)</li>
<li>DON&#8217;T use sliders; they&#8217;re too hard to adjust when there are too many values.</li>
<li>Respond fast.</li>
<li>Provide help, not tooltips (that people on mobile don&#8217;t discover as easily)</li>
<li>DON&#8217;T have an unintuitive success path.</li>
<li>Mobile is &#8220;short attention span theatre;&#8221; people often forget what they&#8217;re doing or don&#8217;t understand.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Collaging: Getting Answers to the Questions You Didn&#8217;t Know to Ask, Kyle Soucy</h3>


<ul>
<li>Collaging is a &#8220;need evaluation&#8221; technique.</li>
<li>Honestly, collaging is great and <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/06/collaging-getting-answers-questions-you-dont-know-ask/">this article</a> describes it better than I could here.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Agile UX: Embrace or Tolerate? Rob Keefer</h3>


<ul>
<li>People who struggle with agile dev so do because devs take over and do &#8220;cowboy development&#8221;</li>
<li>Agile is developer-centric. There&#8217;s little time for design or testing.</li>
<li>Remind people to value people over features, feedback over opinion, ease of use over ease of development, discovery over documentation (ex. don&#8217;t handhold)</li>
<li>Doing things together is better!</li>
</ul>




<h2>Day 3 Talks</h2>


<h3>Writing Great Persona Stories, Whitney Quesenbery</h3>


<ul>
<li>Stories are important because they help us remember people who are not in the room.</li>
<li>Persona stories help communicate patterns of use</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t include people with disabilities in the beginning, they&#8217;re not going to be included later</li>
<li>You might know your audience, but do you know how to use your knowledge of them?</li>
<li>Make sure your stories are connecting people emotionally to your work. It&#8217;s the individual story that gets you to donate and work for someone, not the numbers of people that need help.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t tell stories of how your users are dumb, but of how they accomplish things</li>
</ul>




<h3>Tools for Mobile UX Design, Steven Hoober</h3>


<ul>
<li>To design for mobile:
<ol>
<li>DON&#8217;T draw (until you understand your solution). Otherwise, you&#8217;re going to lock yourself into interactions and events that might not even answer the problem.</li>
<li>Ecosystems first. Figure out your user flows and platforms.</li>
<li>Experience mobile daily. If you&#8217;re going to design for a Blackberry, get one.</li>
<li>Work at scale. (ex. don&#8217;t work on mockups that aren&#8217;t at phone size)</li>
<li>Annotate, describe, understand.</li>
<li>Evaluate (early, as much as you can, before release).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Define your design. What are the goals and objectives of your users and organization? What are users doing now to solve the problem you are trying to help them with?</li>
<li>If you structure your processes correctly, they will be collaborative.</li>
<li><a href="http://getlaunch.com">LAUNCH</a>: mobile prototyping</li>
<li>Describing is more powerful than prototyping. Specying with words encourages people to design more lightweight-ly. ex. &#8220;use default icons&#8221; instead of finding logos to display at the right size and color for your prototype</li>
<li>Evaluate: Does your information architecture make sense? Are there errors? Is there a &#8220;happy path&#8221;? ARE YOU LYING?</li>
</ul>




<h3>Anticipatory Services &amp; Ambient Personalisation, Oli Shaw</h3>


<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s our relationship to the invisible services that power our work?</li>
<li>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on in that black box, but install it and we&#8217;ll give you lower car insurance&#8221; — how can this be expanded?</li>
<li>Uninvited personalisation is becoming more creepy</li>
<li>London trash bins that are tracking wifi-connected smartphones: can tell who you&#8217;re with, where you work, where you&#8217;re at&#8230;.technology is evolving faster than our laws can protect us</li>
<li>It&#8217;s the designer&#8217;s responsibility to push back and protect users</li>
<li>DON&#8217;T patronize, obscure, confuse, dictate</li>
<li>DO use discretion, appropriate, be relevant, and empathize.</li>
<li>Design a relationship, not just an experience.</li>
</ul>




<h3>The World is a Screen, Andrew Hinton</h3>


<ul>
<li>&#8220;All our cognition is embedded&#8230;brains evolved in the service of cognition&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;information is elements in the environment that tells us what the environment affords&#8221;</li>
<li>Perception only exists insofar as we perceive affordances&#8230;&#8221; You don&#8217;t perceive anything unless you understand its structure and how to interact with it.</li>
<li>Before being literate was a thing, buildings were the way we told stories — cathedrals, gargoyles&#8230;</li>
<li>The way we talk and write about our shared environment makes that environment. ex. be careful about assuming things like &#8220;the TV is the second screen&#8221; — this isn&#8217;t true for everyone.</li>
<li>Avocado: an app for couples that lets them send hugs to each other.</li>
<li>Check: are the rules behind the environment clearly expressed in its information?</li>
</ul>




<h3>How People Really Touch and Feel, Steve Hoober</h3>


<ul>
<li>Mobile traffic outnumbers web traffic</li>
<li>&#8220;phablet&#8221; — a phone tablet. omg</li>
<li>People will slow to tap the edges of their phone screen; they are more inaccurate there</li>
<li>Make sure your simple interactions just work before moving on to delightful animation</li>
<li>Be consistent — make hitboxes conventionally large.</li>
<li>A rule of thumb: don&#8217;t pr stuff about the target below the target, ex. with carousels, don&#8217;t put labels beneath the pictures because people&#8217;s thumbs will cover it.</li>
<li>Minimum size of hitbox: 6mm. Preferred size: 8mm.</li>
<li>Watch out for interference! Make a circle 8mm in diameter and center it on your hitbox. If the circle intersects with other items, those items will interfere.</li>
<li>Anything in the edges of the screen or the top and bottom borders should be big.</li>
<li>Design by zones. Put things you want people to use on the center.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/millenium.jpg" alt="Millenium Actress poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Actress/">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>A movie studio is being torn down. TV interviewer Genya Tachibana has tracked down its most famous star, Chiyoko Fujiwara, who has been a recluse since she left acting some 30 years ago. Tachibana delivers a key to her, and it causes her to reflect on her career; as she&#8217;s telling the story, Tachibana and Kyoji Ida, his long-suffering cameraman are drawn in. The key was given to her as a teenager by a painter and revolutionary that she helped to escape the police. She becomes an actress because it will make it possible to track him down, and she spends the next several decades acting out that search in various genres and eras. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Actress">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>I watched <em>Millenium Actress</em> with A partly on a whim and partly because she started salivating the instant that she came across images of it online and remembered its existence. Reading about it on Wikipedia now, it looks like it&rsquo;s by Satoshi Kon, which would make it the first film of his that I&rsquo;ve seen. It&rsquo;s a beautiful film with all the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichi-go_ichi-e">ichi go ichi e</a>&rdquo; atmospheres that I&rsquo;ve come to notice and love in Japanese stories since studying chadou one winter.</p>

<p>Why you should watch it:</p>

<ul>
<li>The animation is beautiful.</li>
<li>The story itself is crisp and well-written, super focused, with both moments that are hilarious and heart-clenchingly bittersweet.</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul>
<li>The main point of the story is that &#8220;the actress does everything in her life to reunite with the man she met once and fell in love with&#8221; — which isn&#8217;t totally new and interesting on its own.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to the kindness of R, I was able to attend the final day of the <a href="http://seattleaaff.org/2014/">Seattle Asian-American Film Festival</a>, an event whose existence I was only barely aware of before R invited me.</p>

<p>We had tickets to see two full documentaries and one short experimental film.</p>

<h2><em>One Generation’s Time: The Legacy Of Silme Domingo &amp; Gene Viernes</em> | <em>To Manong Carlos</em></h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/onegenerationstime.jpg" alt="Photographs of Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes, two Filipino-American activists"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://seattleaaff.org/2014/shorts-programs/one-generations-time-the-legacy-of-silme-domingo-gene-viernes-to-manong-carlos/">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>One short experimental film followed by documentary feature, <em>One Generation’s Time: The Legacy of Silme Domingo & Gene Viernes</em>.</blockquote>


<p><em>One Generation&rsquo;s Time</em> is about the work that Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes did to bring equal working conditions the Filipinos employed seasonally at Alaska canneries. In the 1970s, white workers had access to better food and better living situations than Filipinos doing the same work. Furthermore, on days with less work, rather than being allowed to rest, Filipinos were instructed to move empty cans from one side of warehouses just so they were paid for &ldquo;doing something.&rdquo; Silme and Gene were both murdered for their work, and the documentary discusses the political motivations of the murders, and how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos">Marcos dictatorship</a> was involved. The film was directed by Shannon Gee.</p>

<p><em>To Manong Carlos</em> is a short film directed by Adrian Arilla, about his experiences as a Filipino coming to live and call America his home.</p>

<p>Why you should watch these:</p>

<ul><li><em>One Generation&#8217;s Time</em> introduces the complicated situation and political machinations of behind Silme and Gene&#8217;s work well; probably because, as Shannon Gee said in a panel afterward, she herself was entirely new to this story.</li>
<li><em>To Manong Carlos</em> is a beautiful film where Arilla&#8217;s experiences are interspersed with quotes from Carlos Bulosan&#8217;s <em>America is in the Heart</em>. Reading these quotes alongside Arilla&#8217;s modern experiences gives a special poignancy to Bulosan&#8217;s &#8220;old&#8221; writings, which are still incredibly relevant today. In a media atmosphere where the stories of Filipinos are either rarely told or outright suffocated, it&#8217;s moving to remember that we <em>do</em> have stories, that we have a history. We don&#8217;t drift to America as &#8220;minority&#8221; individuals separate and small, but that we follow and build on the work and words that have come before us.</li>
</ul>




<h2><em>Seeking Asian Female</em></h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/seeking_asian_female.jpg" alt="Poster for Seeking Asian Female, depicting a white man and a Chinese woman in wedding attire, and the director of the documentary, a Chinese woman."/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/seeking-asian-female-m100102931">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote><em>seeking asian female</em> is an eccentric modern love story about Steven and Sandy—an aging white man with “yellow fever” who is obsessed with marrying any Asian woman, and the young Chinese bride he finds online. Debbie, a Chinese American filmmaker, documents and narrates with skepticism and humor, from the early stages of Steven’s search, through the moment Sandy steps foot in America for the first time, to a year into their precarious union. Global migration, Sino-American relations and the perennial battle of the sexes, weigh in on the fate of their marriage in this intensely captivating personal documentary. (<a href="http://www.seekingasianfemale.com/the-film/">Seeking Asian Female</a>)</blockquote>


<p>I&rsquo;ve been dying to see <em>Seeking Asian Female</em> since coming across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbGrQe17cU">the trailer</a> a year or two ago. Watching it at the Seattle Asian-American Film Festival was particularly gratifying, as the entire theater was groaning and laughing every time a white person swooned about the &ldquo;servant girl&rdquo;-ishness and &ldquo;green papaya fragrance&rdquo; of the Asian women they saw (and smelled?) in their minds.</p>

<p>Why you should watch it:</p>

<ul><li>It&#8217;s as hilarious as it is cringe-worthy. You cringe and laugh as you cringe.</li>
<li>The story is well told.</li>
<li>The director does a great job telling the story of Sandy, the &#8220;Asian Female&#8221; of this film, and also examines the ethics of herself being in the middle of this relationship.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m happy that something like the Seattle Asian-American Film Festival exists, and hope it continues next year. Watching both movies, I was reminded of N&rsquo;s quote at our last AB meeting: &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t tell our stories, our stories tell us.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It came to my attention recently that not only are the majority of the users for one of my projects using Opera Mini, but that Opera Mini has a Very Special way of dealing with Javascript.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-mini-web-content-authoring-guidelines/#javascript">their authoring guidelines</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
while Mini supports JavaScript just as well as Opera Desktop, interactivity is somewhat more limited. When the user clicks a link or a button, then the Mini client sends that information back to the server, where the server performs the associated action (such as loading a new page, executing some JavaScript, etc.).
<br/><br/>
For authors, the upshot of all this is that once a page has been rendered by the server, it won&#8217;t change until the user does something on that and there is no way for scripts to run in the background. The user must do something to make Mini talk to the server in order for JavaScript to be unpaused. As a result, you cannot expect things like JavaScript animations or timed Ajax updates to work in the background as they would on a desktop browser.
<br/><br/>
JavaScript running on the Mini server will only run for a couple of seconds before pausing, for resource constraint reasons. This applies to JavaScript run due to an event firing e.g. onload, as well as code run because of a user action.</blockquote>


<p>I&rsquo;m still working on getting it properly working, which seems impossible given the bulk of Javascript used in this case and its heavy reliance on Ajax.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After about seven years with the same litle phone, I finally decided to upgrade. If I&rsquo;m being honest, I did it because the iPhone 5S/5C camera seemed like such an improvement over the previous, and I really wanted to have access to a camera usable in ordinary situations. (My old Motorola was also starting to have problems — bad audio, bad button sensitivity.)</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/vsco0.jpg" alt="My old phone."/></p>

<p class="caption">goodbye dear friend</p>


<p>The pictures that my phone takes are great — better than the pictures my old work iPod had, and definitely better than no pictures taken at all. But, what makes my silly phone photos really fun and gorgeous is the <a href="http://vsco.co/vscocam">VSCO Cam app</a>.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/vsco1.jpg" alt="the foggy ferry dock on thanksgiving"/></p>

<p class="caption">the foggy ferry dock on thanksgiving</p>


<p>You can take pictures from the app or import them, and then control expore, temperature, white balance, saturation&hellip;I have to admit, though, that it took me forever to realize that bottom bar that showed all these editing options is actually something you can scroll from left to right.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/vscobar.png" alt="a photo of a girl"/></p>

<p class="caption">these colors were seriously bland and boring before i edited it.<br/>and,there&#8217;s that bar. it doesn&#8217;t look scrollable at all.</p>


<p>There are also a variety of filters which, to me, are way more subtle and attractive than Instagram&rsquo;s filters. I admit that I use the F2 filter way more than the others.</p>

<p>For some weeks now I&rsquo;ve been working on the portfolio site of a local artist (who is also A&rsquo;s mother). It&rsquo;s been fun. The website can be accessed <a href="http://fongbaatz.com">here</a>. Parts of the process are documented on <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/fongportfolio">my Tumblr</a>.</p>

<p>This weekend she and other artists are having an open house at Magnuson Building 30, which was repurposed by the city of Seattle for their work. The open house is on January 19th, from 2:00 to 5:00 pm. Check it out!</p>
