Okay. Nice. I started grabbing Chapel Geists and also, at some point, a Cloistered Youth, Screeching Bats for the bomb factor, a Falkenwrath Noble. There&#8217;s just something so classy about white/black.<br /><br />Second pack: Hinterland Harbor, Innistrad&#8217;s rare blue/green land, something I&#8217;d like but which doesn&#8217;t fit the colors I&#8217;m primarily using. Shoot. Luckily Andou was the person I was passing to, and I was sure that he would take it. &gt;)<br /><br />Third pack: <i>Skaab Ruinator. &nbsp;</i>Which pretty much required&nbsp;that I start using blue along with my other two colors.<br /><br />Figuring out how much mana is appropriate for a deck is what I think is the hardest about deck-building. &nbsp;It was a struggle especially in this one, since I had Screeching Bats, Geist-Honored Monks, and the Ruinator &#8211; each of which require two black, two white, and two blue mana respectively, which makes selecting colors harder. &nbsp;Still, this deck did pretty well; at the very least there were few cases in which I didn&#8217;t have mana at all, and when I had Skaab Ruinator I always managed to push him out successfully.<br /><br />The full list &#8211;<br /><br /><b>Creatures</b><br />1x Skaab Ruinator<br />1x Cloistered Youth<br />1x Silverchase Fox<br />1x Geist-Honored Monk<br />1x Unruly Mob<br />1x Slayer of the Wicked<br />2x Chapel Geist<br />1x Thraben Sentry<br />1x Village Bell-Ringer<br />1x Disciple of Griselbrand<br />2x Screeching Bat<br />1x Village Cannibals<br />1x Falkenrath Noble<br />1x Morkrut Bansee<br /><br /><b>Spells/Artifacts</b><br />1x Moment of Heroism<br />1x Rebuke<br />1x Bonds of Faith<br />1x Skeletal Grimace<br />1x Blazing Torch<br />1x Silver-Inlaid Dagger<br /><br /><b>Lands</b><br />8x Swamp<br />7x Plains<br />5x Island<br /><br />In the end, Matt won &#8211; he had a deck with 3&nbsp;<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=243211">Burning Vengeance</a>, which made ashes of everyone. <br /><br /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Since it was free on iTunes some time ago (and then again yesterday), I downloaded <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5922851514316195975">Minesweeper of Wizard</a>.  I never did learn how to play Minesweeper with any complexity beyond a simple random-peck method until my smiley-face guy suddenly had dead &#8220;X&#8221; eyes, but it turns out Minesweeper is simple enough.  When you click a square and it reveals a number to you, that number is representative of how many bombs are located in the neighboring squares.  I have to admit that I am probably more pro at this game than I ever could have been before thanks to a course I took in computer vision, a.k.a. Find The Neighbors of a Pixel and Do Something 101.<br /><br />Minesweeper of Wizard ties several stages of minesweeping up around a loose story.  You are a wizard. &nbsp;You need to surface the world from darkness.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0G4Gn3p79E8/TujWTjn9fxI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/1RtjlSvsoAs/s1600/IMG_0124.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0G4Gn3p79E8/TujWTjn9fxI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/1RtjlSvsoAs/s320/IMG_0124.PNG" width="214" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">adorable graphics</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Each stage is graded from one to five stars depending on how fast you completed the game.  And it was because of this that I stopped playing on level 5.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--NRRW00EqKM/TujWZLVNKUI/AAAAAAAAAjc/1gnSUumJQbk/s1600/IMG_0144.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--NRRW00EqKM/TujWZLVNKUI/AAAAAAAAAjc/1gnSUumJQbk/s320/IMG_0144.PNG" width="214" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i hate you</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The type of person/player that I am is emotionally uncomfortable with passing onto next levels until I have completed things 100%.  I did pretty well on the first four levels, but for some reason I just <em>cannot</em> get more than four stars on that fifth level.  I started with a finish time of 1:20, played the level over and over again, managed to whittle my time all the way down to 0:40 &#8211; and what do I get?  4 stars.<br /><br /><em>IMPERFECTION.</em><br /><br />Andou pointed out that some people can finish Minesweeper in a matter of eyeblinks, and yes, it&#8217;s true that I did somehow manage to improve and cut my time down by more than half.  But still, this is <em>level 5</em>. How hard are the other levels going to be?! &nbsp;And it&#8217;s not just your pure logic that factors into your time &#8211; the game itself is the first I&#8217;ve played for iOS that actually feels non-responsive, and also lags.<br /><br />Minesweeper thirst having awakened, I went off to find a new app.  The one that I liked the best of the free apps I found is <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5922851514316195975">Minesweeper Free+ by Cookie Balloon</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-trQOMYR9Ado/TujWsJ2LLCI/AAAAAAAAAjo/rQ9cbk5IPOc/s1600/IMG_0126.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-trQOMYR9Ado/TujWsJ2LLCI/AAAAAAAAAjo/rQ9cbk5IPOc/s320/IMG_0126.PNG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Minesweeper Free+</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Pros:</b><br /><ul><li>Chrome/Glowy graphics are nice.</li><li>No lag!</li><li>It provides multiple board sizes (easy, medium, hard).</li><li>It&#8217;s exactly what it is.</li></ul><br /><b>Cons:</b><br /><ul><li>The little &#8220;flag a square!&#8221; button on the top-right is teensy and hard to press, and there&#8217;s no visual feedback on the board that shows whether it&#8217;s been selected or not.  Result: I often try to flag a square where I know a bomb is, and instead just set it off. :(</li><li>The message for &#8220;YOU WIN!&#8221; feels a little anti-climatic/un-victorious.  I just spent like 7 minutes poking this puzzle!  I wish there was a score or some other way that it tallied up how you did&#8230;maybe show a Bejeweled Blitz-esque graph or something of your progress second by second&#8230;ah well.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q71ixkULEes/TujXCYKvWBI/AAAAAAAAAjw/8UDWL720Qio/s1600/IMG_0134.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q71ixkULEes/TujXCYKvWBI/AAAAAAAAAjw/8UDWL720Qio/s320/IMG_0134.PNG" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div></div>

&quot;Hamburger-style&quot; as in, the opening of the notebook going horizontally instead of vertically!  Though now that you mention it, I learned that phrasing in kindergarten for folding 8x11 sheets of paper.  I wonder if it really can be applied to notebooks&#8230;</div>

(Sluts!)</div><div><br /></div><div>Part of the funny may relate to the assumption that this girl is using cards to appear &#8220;nerdy,&#8221; which is nowadays &#8221;<a href="http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/i-am-a-female-nerd-apparently/">a new stereotype of femininity</a>.&#8221; You can&#8217;t tell that this is the case from a single picture. &nbsp;I mean, how could you rationalize it? &nbsp;<i>This girl doesn&#8217;t really like Yu-Gi-Oh! cards! &nbsp;She&#8217;s just showing off!</i>&nbsp; Yeah! &nbsp;Go sit back in your corner and where no one can see you, shoo! &nbsp;Only then can you <i>really </i>be a True Nerd.</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
From <em>Re-Space-ing Place: &#8220;Place&#8221; and &#8220;Space&#8221; Ten Years On</em>:<br /><blockquote>My goal [in this paper] is to understand two related developments over the last decade. <strong>One is the way in which the conceptual distinction between place and space has been taken up by [computer-supported cooperative work] researchers</strong>, and to see what kinds of light we might be able to cast on this by returning to the roots of this distinction in fields such as geography and urban studies that have something to say about the social organization of spaces. The other is the ways in which our heightened understanding of the issues of mobility and information as an aspect of everyday life, emerging out of studies and experiences with mobile technologies, might reinvigorate a conceptual exploration of questions of practice and spatiality, and help us deepen our understandings of the implications of arguments about place and space.<br /></blockquote><br />I&#8217;m always surprised by HCI&#8217;s pure ability to study People Doing Things, whether its people out living their lives in the world, or <em>other people studying HCI.</em></div>

Bus drivers in Seattle will sometimes talk to passengers as they enter the bus.  As passengers step up, the drivers will put their hands over the little fare box to obstruct it, and repeat, loudly, &#8220;Pay as you leave.  <em>Pay as you leave.  PAY AS YOU LEAVE.</em>&#8221;<br /><br />Alas!  It&#8217;s too late.  The person was talking on their cellphone and already swiped their Orca card on the Orca card reader.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bC74HOcr-8/UCLmDvd3phI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/U-4kald-qnA/s1600/3465566019_86060511e0.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bC74HOcr-8/UCLmDvd3phI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/U-4kald-qnA/s320/3465566019_86060511e0.jpg" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">photo by JeanineAnderson (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeanineanderson/3465566019/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After doing this, the bus driver will usually just sigh.<br /><br />Orca is (essentially) just a fancy debit card for public transportation in some counties around southern Puget Sound.  To use, you fill it up with money and then press it against the Orca card reader, which is located further away than the bus driver can reach to block it from hasty passengers responding to habit and the design of the bus entranceway.  Swiping your Orca card incorrectly may result in some weird things happening with your fare (things possibly related to how your transfers are monitored), and though I don&#8217;t know the exact repercussions of paying when you enter the bus instead of when you exit, it is kind of sad to see bus drivers being frustrated with this, especially since I learned in an Informatics class last year that bus drivers have some pretty serious rules governing their work.<br /><br />Also especially since I feel like there are a couple ways you could mitigate this frustration:<br /><ul><li><strong>Move the Orca card reader closer to the bus driver.</strong>  Then the bus driver could reach over and cover the card reader much in the same way I see them covering the fare box.  I think this could be the least expensive solution.</li><li><strong>If someone tries to pay when they are not supposed to, the Orca reader shouldn&#8217;t charge them.</strong>  There are already <a href="http://www.onebusaway.org/">technologies</a> in use that make use of what I assume is a capability to know where a bus is at a certain time, which could be used to know when people should be charged, and for what rate.  (Presently drivers fiddle with the Orca card readers to make sure that people get charged properly, which seems like it may be an unnecessary task.) People try to pay for the bus all the time in the Ride Free area and it doesn&#8217;t matter how many nice, green &#8220;Ride Free&#8221; signs there are, they just don&#8217;t read &#8211; so just account for it.  Extra advantage: bus driver thinks less about fares in general, and more about just driving.  (Disadvantage: This doesn&#8217;t account for cash fares.  Also, how are you really supposed to know when people are entering or exiting, to figure out whether they should be charged?<ul><li>Use cameras to measure differences in position to determine a passenger&#8217;s direction?</li><li>Count the number of times a door opens and closes?</li><li>Or, since you don&#8217;t really need to touch Orca cards directly to the Orca card reader and James keeps talking about how easy it is to sniff data from Orca cards, maybe the transaction should just happen as people are standing on the bus, so they don&#8217;t pause to pay with an Orca at all.  Thus you could have something like: a) Charge everyone as they get on the bus, b) If a person leaves the bus in a Ride Free area, put the money back on the card, c) Else, if the person leaves the bus after leaving the Ride Free Area, just leave the charge on the card.)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Granted, these are all probably past the power of our struggling transportation system (though I admit I only describe as struggling due to <a href="http://seattlebikeblog.com/2011/11/09/seattles-prop-1-soundly-defeated/">Prop. 1</a> failing recently and grumbling anecdotes on Facebook about the inefficiency of buses).</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Last week I was convinced to join another tourney at The Dreaming, this time for constructed decks (i.e. decks that you make beforehand with love and high hopes, versus <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/bx-mz7fg7.html">drafted</a> decks).  I say &#8220;convinced&#8221; because I was not planning on participating but rather on sitting on the sidelines writing <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/2011-nanowrimo-limning.html">NaNo</a> and challenging people to friendlies, but then the store worker person came around and said that they were one person short for the &#8220;casual&#8221; tourney (which is a little more low-key than the &#8220;competitive&#8221; tourney, and everyone comes away with a prize of some sort), so I was like, Alright, fine, why not?<br /><br />(Later, I realized that in the first round of the casual tourney, Andou had gotten a by.  Which meant that they actually had the right amount of people for a tourney!  Wat!)<br /><br /><a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/silly-werewolf-deck-v2.html">Werewolf deck</a> was fun (as usual) but I ended up winning only one of my matches, against someone who purportedly threw his deck together for lols and was planning to dismantle it immediately after the tourney.<br /><br />Themes I noticed/learned:<br /><ul><li><strong>I was able to consistently pull off <em>super</em> strong openings</strong>, to the extent that people I was playing against would sigh and say &#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re going to win this one&#8221; before thoroughly putting me down some turns later.  Still, dat strong opening!  Turn 1 Reckless Waif, turn 2 transform and play Full Moon&#8217;s Rise and swing for 4.  <em>Go Waif go!</em></li><li><strong>One of the most stark problems I had was resisting creature spot removal</strong>, i.e. that one match where the guy kept using Arc Trail to pick off my werewolves and then hitting me and then putting out Stormblood Berserker, ugh.  Not to mention that he would usually be able to play multitudes of spells which could either prevent transformation or force it back to humans.</li><li><strong>You can target Illusions with Kessig Wolf Run to kill them!</strong>  That&#8217;s pretty useful.</li><li>Also useful (though not for me): cards like Ratchet Bomb, which can destroy things with 0 mana cost for free.  <strong>Apparently werewolves in transformed form technically have 0 mana cost</strong> and can therefore instantly die.  Blagh.</li></ul><br />In the end, all was well and good because I still got a foil <a href="http://magiccards.info/zen/en/170.html">Nissa Revane</a> (though it&#8217;s already rotated out of standard and can&#8217;t be played legally in formal tourneys anymore, I guess) and Andou (who won the entire tourney) opened up a foil Instigator Pack which I instantly begged for and received.  Werewolves &lt;3<br /><br />Afterward and over the weekend I played more and came up with more ideas about improving upon Werewolf Deck in general:<br /><br /><ul><li><strong>Birds of Paradise.</strong>  Why?  Because Turn 1 Forest and Birds.  Turn 2, Mountain, and tap all three lands for Daybreak Ranger.  Turn 3, some other land, then tap four for Instigator Gang.  Oh, what?  Your 0/1 Birds can now attack as a 1/1 (or 3/1, if Instigator is transformed)?!</li><li><strong>Spellskite.</strong>  You can use it to pay two life and have any spell or ability&#8217;s target changed to Spellskite, which is a 0/4 too meaty for a single shot with Incinerate, Shock, etc.  Plus it&#8217;s only a 2 drop, which means you can get a really good, cheap defender which can keep werewolves alive from all that sniping!  Cons: It&#8217;s popular in general and therefore about $10 a pop.  Bleh.</li><li><strong>Mask of Avacyn?</strong>  Pro: Also can prevent sniping of werewolves, and also gives extra defense, which wolves lack.  Con: It&#8217;s expensive (2 to summon, 3 to equip) and I haven&#8217;t yet used it successfully.</li><li><strong>Less Daybreaks and Kruins,</strong> i.e. maybe not a set of each in my deck, because I keep getting them in my opening hand an wishing I had either or instead.  Dang you, $1 MTG binder that had Daybreaks.  I was so excited to have as many as possible.</li><li><strong>Red Sun Zenith?</strong>  Because against decks that just fatten the heck up, it&#8217;s hard to find anything to kill large creatures.  Cons: It&#8217;s a sorcery, so, no transformation on the turn I might need it.</li></ul><br /><br />One of the better ways of thinking of ways to improve Werewolf Deck would probably be to find some award-winning werewolf deck online, but I kind of enjoy doing it on my own.</div>
