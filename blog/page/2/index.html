  <div class="entry-content"><p>For HCDE 518 the theme of our projects was &ldquo;UX for Good.&rdquo; I teamed up with three others (Joshua Coppola, Irene Huberman, and Matt Yukubousky) who were interested in solving climate change, and after admitting that &ldquo;solving climate change&rdquo; was going to be out of scope for the quarter, we searched for ways that we could encourage people to make better environmental choices.</p>

<p>One problem in encouraging environmentally friendly choices is that the immediate results of such choices are often negative. Good environmental decisions don&rsquo;t pay off for the actual environment immediately, and often your only tangible &ldquo;reward&rdquo; is the fact that you&rsquo;ve spent more time or money being good, as in the case of going to farmer&rsquo;s markets to buy organic or local produce. (Though for some I know the payoff of farmer&rsquo;s markets is better-tasting food, and forming relationships with the community, etc.)</p>

<p>We were all interested in designing <em>something</em> for our nearby community, and at some point someone finally brought up the concept of &ldquo;freecycling,&rdquo; which is the term for a community that gives and gets items from each other for free. (In this sense, it&rsquo;s really more like &ldquo;free-reusing&rdquo; than &ldquo;free-recycling.&rdquo;) We realized that such a system is perfect for implementation in a college campus, where living situations are temporary and fluid, requiring people to predictably give and get furniture like beds and couches when the academic year turns. Additionally, undergraduates in particular, lacking free-flowing cash, have a need of used items like textbooks and whatever other paraphernalia required of them in classes, like clickers. Groups in Seattle exist already for freecycling, such as <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/freecycleseattle/info">Seattle Freecycle</a>, but none geared specifically for students who might need to quickly get rid of a bed before move-out, or require a specific edition of a book for a class.</p>

<p>Realizations in hand, we established our design question: <strong>How can we use technology to encourage reuse of goods within the University of Washington community?</strong></p>

<p>And after Bruce Perry came up with the perfect name for our project — <em>UniCycle</em> — we were all in.</p>

<h2>Surveys</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/unicycle/surveys.png" alt="Screenshot of some survey responses."/></p>

<p class="caption">screenshot of some survey responses</p>


<p>We developed a (somewhat long-ass) survey to kick off our user research, and distributed it across our social networks, the UW group we found at Reddit, and a Facebook group devoted to &ldquo;UW Textbook Exchange.&rdquo; The feedback we received overall to the idea of &ldquo;a site where people can easily exchange textbooks&rdquo; was very positive:</p>

<blockquote>“This idea is great and I hope it takes form soon! It eliminates the middle man like buffalo exchange that rips off the sellers and charges more for certain items to buyers to make profit.&#8221; - /u/huskygurll</blockquote>


<p>On the bright side, we learned that there are some clear pain points when students try to get rid of their stuff. Though many students desire to sell their textbooks and furniture, many do not because they don&rsquo;t want to go through the hassle of setting up prices, haggling, meeting up with people. In the case of female students, there was also the extra overhead of making sure they were safe when interacting with strangers.</p>

<p>Though we initially wanted to create a site that was devoted to <em>just</em> students giving each other things for free, students&#8217; reported consciousness of money made this unfeasible. Survey participants reported occasinally that, if they could not get enough money for Item X, they&rsquo;d rather keep it. With this in mind, we decided to design a hub for students to not just give each other things for free, but also sell or barter them away. &ldquo;Free items&rdquo; could continue to be our main headliner, however, something to draw people in the same way that Priceline draws customers with their &ldquo;name your own price&rdquo; system.</p>

<h2>Design Mapping</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/unicycle/designmapping.png" alt="Team UniCycle design mapping, and a close-up photo of the design mapping."/></p>

<p class="caption">design mapping</p>


<p>One design technique that was new to be this quarter was <strong>design mapping</strong>, which involves thinking through a user flow and taking note of everything that comes up using sticky notes. Green notes can stand for goals, pink notes for concerns, yellow for extra considerations, blue for possible new features — and so on. One thing I love about design mapping is that you are able to keep track of everything. When talking about how to support Yosh&rsquo;s desire to buy an old couch online, we don&rsquo;t need to silence the person that starts talking about bed bugs, and chastise them for going off-topic — we just add it to the map, and continue forward.</p>

<p>Design mapping helped us get a grip on the kinds of behaviors that we wanted to support with UniCycle: buy a used item, put a used item up for sale, contact a seller, and so on.</p>

<h2>Sketches</h2>


<p>We did a ton of sketches. Just, tons of them.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/unicycle/sketches2.png" alt="Sketching UniCycle UI on a whiteboard."/></p>

<p class="caption">here are just a few of them</p>


<p>I have to admit that it was hard to come up with so many ideas individually and then have to figure out how to actually move forward. It took us most of the afternoon, a huge whiteboard, and a lot of back-and-forth to decide on the almost-final interface that we wanted to go with, Once we did decide, it was tough to decide who was going to have the responsibility of moving forward with creating a paper prototype, or creating a digital prototype with something like Axure, which some of us wanted experience using.</p>

<p>It was at this time that we decided to try out a search based on &ldquo;hashtags,&rdquo; like Twitter or Tumblr. Because people could sell a variety of items on this site, we thought this would best allow them to categorize their items as they see fit. Additionally, hashtags like <code>#chem300</code> could be catch-alls for whatever you needed for a Chemistry 300 course: textbooks, clickers, lab coats, and so on.</p>

<h2>Paper Prototyping</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/unicycle/paperprototype.png" alt="Photos of the UniCycle paper prototype."/></p>

<p class="caption">photos of the paper prototype</p>


<p>I took partial responsibility for the paper prototype and the ensuing paper-scrap fest. Rendering the variety of items that people could &ldquo;search for&rdquo; using our paper UI was the most challenging bit, as was searching for the right pieces to show on the display. We created little modals to mimic &ldquo;Loading results&hellip;&rdquo; which were fun to use, and we also tried to solve for cases in which our paper prototype testers might search for an item that we didn&rsquo;t anticipate.</p>

<h2>Interactive Prototype</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/unicycle/unicycle_prototype.png" alt="Screenshot of UniCycle Interactive Prototype."/></p>

<p class="caption">screenshot of UniCycle&#8217;s interactive prototype</p>


<p>Our final product was an interactive prototype made in Axure by all of us, using a pretty fantastic blend of Axure&rsquo;s built-in SVN versioning and Dropbox. It is currently hosted <a href="http://students.washington.edu/jhc1/hcde518/start.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>My most beloved aspects of it are those that give feedback to users&#8217; actions. For example, the main page features tickets that enumerate the number of goods reused thus far, to surface the fact that people really <em>are</em> accomplishing something great through their small actions.</p>

<p>We also have some special tweaks just for UW students. For example, if you are looking for a particular textbook, you can list it on UniCycle. If you&rsquo;re selling, you can list a book by ISBN and have the titles and authors filled in automatically. Once you list a book, you are also made aware of the number of people who might already have that book marked as &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; — which is intended to help people feel like it&rsquo;s easy to sell on UniCycle. We also surface &ldquo;duedates&rdquo; for items, valuable if a user is trying to get rid of a bed before their lease is up.</p>

<p>After having dealt with it for a majority of the quarter, I&rsquo;m not totally sold on Axure yet, and will not likely use it to personally make hi-fidelity prototypes in the future. At that point in the process, I&rsquo;d just prefer to code things up myself. Additionally, I personally love the speed and humble honesty of paper prototyping, compared to Axure&rsquo;s interactive prototypes, which to me slip somewhat into the uncanny valley.</p>

<p>That being said, I&rsquo;m sure there will come a time when Axure is uniquely valuable, and I did like having to <em>not</em> worry about vertically centering random elements in CSS. Coding UniCycle as the sole programmer in a team of four would have been extremely taxing and it&rsquo;s nice that using Axure allowed us to work on a level playing field.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>


<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ll return to UniCycle given the plethora of other projects I have, but it would be great to see it go places, especially given the need for it at UW. Too much goes wasted, and I&rsquo;d love to see people get into the habit of asking their community for needed items, as well as help others when it&rsquo;s needed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also made a <a href="/files/hcde518_portfolio_deck.pdf">portfolio deck</a> that goes over other details for this project.</p>

<p class="caption">AU Issue VIII at Bulldog News</p>


<p>I&rsquo;m into my last couple months as a UW student, and these are my last couple months to submit to <a href="http://strayingfromreality.wordpress.com/">AU</a>, UW&rsquo;s speculative fiction journal. Since the <a href="/blog/2012-12-30-short-story-golemists-work.html">last time I&rsquo;ve written about it</a> I&rsquo;ve had two more acceptances! The story that I&rsquo;ll talk about in this post is <em>Chronectomy</em>, written for the Winter 2012, Issue VIII prompt: <em>chronos</em>, or time.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/chronectomy2.JPG" alt="Chronectomy!"/></p>

<p class="caption">Chronectomy! I LOVE what the editors did with the &#8220;O&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>


<p>I came up with an idea almost immediately and wrote furiously for a couple hours before realizing I was writing entirely the wrong story, and redid the entire thing. I&rsquo;m still working on a place to host my short stories online, but at least for now you can read <em>Chronectomy</em> on <a href="http://neauro.com">my portfolio</a>.</p>

<p>[ spoilers follow ]</p>

<p>I was really happy with the way I described the chronectomy clinic in this draft, but there were a couple problems overall that made me realize I had to totally redo it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I intended this draft&#8217;s appeal to be that the audience has no idea what&#8217;s going on, but I realized that I wanted to write something a little deeper. In this draft, once you realize that the clinic is about removing memories, there&#8217;s not much else to get out of it.</li>
  <li>The protagonist of this draft, Alice, doesn&#8217;t have a very clear motive. Again, I was relying on there to be some kind of &#8220;Oohh, why is she here?&#8221; feeling to pull the audience through, but I wasn&#8217;t confident that all this exposition and description would be fun to read on its own, when you don&#8217;t even know why the character is there.</li>
  <li>At the end, I wanted to pull a sort of &#8220;Whoa! Bet you didn&#8217;t see that coming!&#8221; moment, where the clinician suddenly steals the protagonist&#8217;s memories for himself — but I realized that by the time you reach the end, you don&#8217;t know enough about him at all to care that he stole her memories, nor do you know why he did so. You also never know the protagonist well enough to care that her memories were stolen, since she&#8217;s shrouded in mystery for the draft&#8217;s majority.</li>
  <li>Since the original prompt was related to &#8220;time,&#8221; my initial intention was to explore what people would do with time — selling it, donating it, using it to heal their mental trauma, and so on. When the clinician starts reciting all these uses to the protagonist, I realized that those things were all way more interesting than what was happening right then in the story, and that furthermore, all these uses were just being talked about, and not actually experienced.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, I realized the better perspective to use for this story was not Alice but the clinician, and why he would steal someone else&rsquo;s memory in the first place.</p>

<p>Draft below the cut.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A is starting a certificate program in game design this quarter and I&rsquo;ve been helping him with his card game, Invent-o-thon.</p>

<p>The prompt being something related to <em>Victorian Combat</em>, he first went around researching what people &ldquo;first thought of when they think about the Victorian Era,&rdquo; and I was happy to hammer in the presence of Ada Lovelace, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">The World&rsquo;s First Computer Programmer</a>. Because I&rsquo;m more interested in stories, I also talked with him about stories — in particular, making noteworthy experiences that people are excited to talk to each other about after the fact. Or, in general, creating situations in which people&rsquo;s imaginations are prompted and stretch and fill in ridiculous gaps.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/inventothon/playtest1.jpg" alt="What is a faith-powered tummy mobile?"/></p>

<p class="caption">what is a faith-powered tummy mobile FIGURE IT OUT DO IT</p>


<p>A obtained a bunch of card sleeves and post-it notes for our paper prototyping. The point of the game is to create an invention over several rounds, then present it at &ldquo;showtime&rdquo; to everyone and roll dice to see if your invention explodes. Thus far, players construct machines using three decks: one deck to describe a &ldquo;power source&rdquo; (like &ldquo;electric&rdquo;), one deck to describe a &ldquo;subject&rdquo; (like &ldquo;kittens&rdquo;), and one deck to describe the actual invention (like &ldquo;generator&rdquo;).</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/inventothon/playtest1_cards.JPG" alt="Playtest cards"/></p>

<p class="caption">physically impossible bathtub packer</p>


<p>We also gathered friends to do a playtest at a cafe.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/inventothon/playtest2.jpg" alt="Playtest cards"/></p>

<p class="caption">kind of pathetic pleasure chamber&#8230;and others</p>


<p>One of the most valuable things learned from prototyping was which cards were compelling and funny, and which cards weren&rsquo;t — descriptive cards that seemed perfectly fine, like &ldquo;hydro-powered&rdquo; or &ldquo;solar-powered,&rdquo; were just not as fun to use as &ldquo;perfectly ordinary&rdquo; or &ldquo;rather moist&rdquo; and never quite made it to showtime. It makes sense that something like &ldquo;perfectly ordinary&rdquo; lights up more parts of your story-minded brain than &ldquo;hydro-powered,&rdquo; and overall could have more flavor. (What&rsquo;s a &ldquo;perfectly ordinary kitten-mobile&rdquo;?)</p>

<p>I sketched out some possibilities for card designs&hellip;</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/inventothon/cardsketch.jpg" alt="Sketches of cards"/></p>

<p class="caption">sketches of cards</p>


<p>&hellip;and A also reined in his sister for some concept art of character roles that players could have that affected their inventions. For example, someone who was Benjamin Franklin might be able to totally swap inventions with someone else before showtime. (Oo! Sick burn!)</p>

<p><em>Thomas Was Alone</em> was super cute, if more ambiguous than I personally like. I liked the personality given to all the different shapes, though their common heroism and conceit got a little old as the game went on, which was why Laura&rsquo;s cynicism made her my favorite (though I felt compelled inexlicably to keep calling her &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo;). I loved that the levels were tilted, the play of light, the strange colors. (Though I wonder if any colorblind users had a hard time playing?)</p>

<p>One thing I think the game could have been improved was the game&rsquo;s sense of progression; though numbers ticked up each level, after a while they became meaningless, and now that the game is finished I&rsquo;m not totally sure what I would use them for. The introduction of each of the colored shapes, Thomas&rsquo;s &ldquo;death,&rdquo; and the era of the gray shapes seemed to be the largest movements in the story, and though each was accompanied with a fun snippet of &ldquo;The AIs are gaining sentience!&rdquo; flavor I didn&rsquo;t really have a sense that things were reaching their end until the end came suddenly to meet me. Some levels seemed like little &ldquo;drabbles&rdquo; and experiments, which I completed without much more effort than would take for me to click a cow in Farmville, and it would have been cool to see something else related to AIs breaking their previous ways of being. Breaking through the borders of levels — intentionally disobeying orders — something to add to the flavor text.</p>

<p>I played <em>Thomas Was Alone</em> on a projector and if you have the opportunity to do so yourself I recommend it. All those rectangles are like way better when they&rsquo;re as big as your face.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been putting off getting a virtual machine running on the Mac computer I use for work, mostly because I wanted to forget the existence of &lt;IE9 browsers entirely. Unfortunately, the visual bugs accumulating across my projects were starting to get a little ridiculous.</p>

<p>After some hours of searching and fiddling, I discovered my favorite solution for running IE on a Mac. It goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the relevant/recent version of Oracle&#8217;s <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>.</li>
<li>Use the Terminal and and run <code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | env IEVMS_VERSIONS="8 9" bash</code> to download 2 virtual machines; one that can run IE8, and one that can run IE9.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s it! Once that&rsquo;s finished, you can open VirtualBox and you&rsquo;ll see your boxes all ready to go.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/09/04/internet-explorer-for-mac-ie7-ie8-ie-9-free/">OSXDaily</a> for the post that led me to finding <a href="https://github.com/xdissent">xdissent</a>&rsquo;s awesome installations.</p>

<p>Other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>border-radius</code>, <code>rem</code>, and <code>opacity</code> are some of the many words not recognized by IE8.</li>
<li>PressF12 to open up IE8&#8217;s Developer Tools.</li>
</ul>

<p>For whatever reason, <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> is becoming my social media site of choice, probably because its humor appeals to me so much. I also love that it supports people easily creating blogs that cater to specific topics &mdash; like <a href="http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/">people of color in medieval art</a>, or <a href="http://moviecode.tumblr.com/">source code in TV and films</a>, or <a href="http://tabcloseddidntread.com/">intrusive pop-ups</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve made my own tumblr for gathering examples of <a href="http//delightful-ux.tumblr.com">delightful user experience</a>, which is my main interest when it comes to the wide world of human-centered design. Even though I love it, I&rsquo;m still muddy on what comprises a delightful user experience, and thus far have tossed in examples of <a href="http://adobe.breach.il.ly/#/about">useful websites with friendly wording</a>, as well as <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/post/71660750263/hells-pizza-coffin-box-new-zealand-based-hell">pizza box designs with unnecessary but awesome utility</A>, and <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/post/71681828062/australian-sharks-send-tweets-to-warn-swimmers">sharks with Twitter accounts</a>.</p>

<p>For now, when deciding whether to add an example, I ask myself, &ldquo;Could this Thing accomplish what it currently accomplishes, but in a more boring way?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Does this Thing solve for an action that is not-that-fun to do?&rdquo; And if the answer to either is &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; — lo, thusly do I deem it delightful.</p>

<p>I understand that second question might still catch Things that are not entirely playful — but I&rsquo;m not going to stress out about differentiating between design that&rsquo;s good and design that fulfills some nebulously defined good feel.</p>

<p>If you have encountered a good feel recently yourself, feel free to <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/submit">submit</a>!</p>

<p>After NaNoWriMo finished, my pastime of choice during my commute became playing through <em>Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies</em>.</p>

<p>[ spoilers ahead ]</p>

<p>Athena was a cool protagonist, though scenes where she was relegated to &ldquo;cyncial dude&rsquo;s naive, enthusiastic female sidekick&rdquo; were yawny. (Come on! Maya and Trucy are already these characters, we don&rsquo;t need more of them.) Ultimately it&rsquo;s nice to see that Athena has her own reasons for entering the attourneyforce, and though they were man-centered they were also totally platonic, which was nice. Athena&rsquo;s devoting to &ldquo;saving&rdquo; Blackquill also mirrored her desire to save her best friend, Juniper Woods, which meant her dramatic, heroic tendencies at least were in character.</p>

<p>Mostly I was happy to see old characters again, even Apollo Justice, who I disliked before but liked in <em>Dual Destinies</em>, probably because he was now a familiar face, haha. What I wanted most out of this game was to see Maya again, but I guess a note from her will do in lieu of <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>I also liked <em>Dual Destinies</em>&lsquo; execution of &ldquo;telling the end at the beginning.&rdquo; One of my favorite parts was realizing that Apollo had had an eyepatch over his eye even <em>before the courtroom explosion</em> — it was a fun/cute manipulation of the audience&rsquo;s assumptions that that particular bandage was just part of his injuries.</p>

<p>Good examples of &ldquo;the end at the beginning&rdquo; does <em>not</em>, however, include all the times that the game felt obliged to either tell you who the antagonist was, or make it clearly obvious, and PWDD&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&comic=123013">serious case of the hand-holdies</a>&rdquo; led to me to really only loving the game&rsquo;s final case, and feeling shruggy about the others. It would have been nice if each case had contributed more to each character&rsquo;s development as well; &ldquo;Ninetails Vale&rdquo; in particular didn&rsquo;t feel tied to anything in the larger story, and as a standalone wasn&rsquo;t terribly interesting to me either.</p>

<p>Documentaries are my whitenoise of choice. Due to studying, I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot more of them on Netflix.</p>

<p>More recently, I&rsquo;ve two documentaries about orcas: <em>Killer Whales</em> by the Discovery Channel, about the behavior of killer whales in the wild; and <em>Blackfish</em>, about orcas held in captivity. They&rsquo;re both pretty incredible; I&rsquo;m shocked at how much footage there is of killer whales doing things, whether it&rsquo;s hunting poisonous sting rays in New Zealand or yanking human beings into pools by their ankles.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hilarious to watch the footage of killer whales hunting seals in the first documentary, with a voiceover of a man marveling at their intelligence; and to watch this footage again in the second, where the background noise is preserved, and a woman is panicking, &ldquo;Oh no! Oh no! <em>On noooo</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Blackfish</em> also connected nicely with the last essay in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Science-Nature-Writing/dp/0547350635">The Best American Science and Nature Writing (2011)</a>, though the writer states there that one of the orca trainers was pulled by her hair into the water, whereas trainers in the <em>Blackfish</em> movie argue that this is a lie, another way to &ldquo;blame the victim&rdquo; of the orca attack, rather than the orca itself and the poor treatment that drove it to &ldquo;psychopathy.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/frozen-poster.jpg" alt="Frozen poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=109012">via</a>)</p>


<p>A and I went to see <em>Frozen</em>, a movie I had very little interest in seeing until I realized Idina Menzel was voicing a main character. There&rsquo;s been a lot said already for the lack of diversity amongst the characters (regarding both <a href="">race</a>, as well as <a href="http://sapphicdalliances.tumblr.com/post/68881922280">the representation of women</a>) and my disappointment about these issues in <em>Frozen</em> has exhausted me utterly. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it. Instead, I want to note aspects of the overall story that A and I discussed after the movie.</p>

<p>[ spoilers ahead ]</p>

<h2><em>Frozen</em> is about Elsa and Anna</h2>

<p>This is great. From the trailers, there was almost no indication that the story&rsquo;s main conflict involved the relationship between two women. Anna struggles somewhat with the men in the story, and though she desires &ldquo;true love&rdquo; at its beginning, lovers never usurp her existing relationship with her sister. At the end, Anna even plays the main role in saving both Elsa and herself, through the power of ~<em>True Love</em>~! Hurray!</p>

<h2>But what does <em>Frozen</em> do with &ldquo;True Love&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>&ldquo;True Love&rdquo; seems to be Frozen&rsquo;s main theme. Elsa&rsquo;s version of True Love is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t harm those who you love,&rdquo; and requires her to isolate herself as a precaution to harming her sister; the fact that doing so makes both her and Anna unhappy are not as important as Anna&rsquo;s safety. At the end of the movie, Elsa realizes (somewhat abruptly) that her version of True Love is flawed, presumably because it&rsquo;s more about fearing herself, rather than loving someone else. (…right? This actually happened so suddenly that I&rsquo;m just going to believe that this is the case.)</p>

<p>In contrast, Anna&rsquo;s version of true love — which could be described as &ldquo;Always believe in someone that you love&rdquo; — has absolutely no fear involved. Despite everyone&rsquo;s warnings and panic, Anna continues to believe the best of Elsa, even when Elsa actually <em>does</em> harm her.</p>

<p>I like how Elsa and Anna&rsquo;s interpretations of love clash in this movie, but one thing I don&rsquo;t like is that, though Elsa&rsquo;s view of love evolves by the end of the movie, Anna&rsquo;s view remains static. From the beginning Anna is the same &ldquo;open to loving people!&rdquo; character that she&rsquo;s shown to be from the beginning, despite events that show people can harm her: Elsa ostracizes her, Love Interest #1 (Hans) betrays her. That these events don&rsquo;t change her outlook on life feels like a waste; rather than actively choosing to love people, for Anna it&rsquo;s just a given, and this takes away from her complexity and agency as a character.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that the events of the movie are put into motion by Elsa&rsquo;s fear that she might kill Anna, and by the end of the movie, it&rsquo;s revealed that there was no way that Elsa could have ever killed Anna at all. The entire time, Anna had a magical understanding of &ldquo;True Love&rdquo; that could have <em>always</em> saved her from Elsa&rsquo;s power, which makes the entire plot somewhat of a non-issue.</p>

<h2>And what did the other characters do?</h2>

<p>Given that the movie&rsquo;s main conflict is Elsa and Anna&rsquo;s relationship, and true love, the other major characters — Kristoff, Olaf, and Hans — all felt thrown in. I would have loved to see them all focused to serve the &ldquo;true love&rdquo; theme by addressing love in different ways. Treated differently, Kristoff could have been a great catalyst for Anna&rsquo;s development of her version of love. I&rsquo;m inagining him, a character distrusting of other humans, teaching her about the horrible things humans do; she fights it (&ldquo;No way, humans are inherently Lawful Good!&rdquo;); Kristoff then points out that her sister is laying waste to their kingdom and also has been pretty mean in general to people; Anna cracks a bit; and then, right on cue, Anna is betrayed again by Hans.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/anna.jpg" alt="Frozen poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">omg will she now become totally jaded? or will she still choose looove? (<A href="http://turntherightcorner.com/2013/09/27/movie-trailer-for-disneys-frozen/disneys-frozen-2013-screenshot-princess-anna/">via</a>)</p>


<p>Kristoff&rsquo;s dislike of humans is played up without explanation of how it came to be, as if he had simply dropped out of the sky as a perfectly-formed gruff male love interest. I would have loved to see more time spent on him and his relationship with Sven and the snow trolls, rather than other seemingly extraneous details of his character. For example, why is it important that Kristoff is an ice merchant, and what was the point of the opening scene that is dedicated to showing his childlike failure at selling ice? You learn later that Kristoff was adopted by the trolls, and distrusts other humans; so if Kristoff was actually homeless at the beginning of the movie, why did he have a sled and ice-harvesting tools at his disposal? (Or was he not homeless? Are we just supposed to be okay with his abduction?) My headcanon involves Kristoff having saved Sven from the cruelties of humans in his life — meeting the trolls — realizing that they&rsquo;re way better.</p>

<p>Olaf was a character I grimaced at in the movie trailers and ended up being pleasantly entertained by.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/olaf.gif" alt="Frozen poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">oh youu (<A href="http://worldbuiltfor2.tumblr.com/post/69015715475/when-someone-emotionally-hurts-you-but-you-have-to">via</a>)</p>


<p>Even though his main purpose is comedic entertainment, it would have been nice to see more about what he means to Anna and Elsa&rsquo;s relationship. He&rsquo;s their precious childhood snowman, and is really the only indication Anna has that Elsa still treasures her after years of being isolated.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/olaf.jpg" alt="Frozen poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">love again, anna! do iiit! (<A href="http://www.rotoscopers.com/2013/09/27/ten-things-we-loved-about-the-new-frozen-trailer/">via</a>)</p>


<p>As for the last major-ish character, Hans: I wasn&rsquo;t too interested in him, and wish that all the time devoted to him was given to the other characters instead. Hans is too flat, an antagonist that comes out of nowhere, affects no one uniquely, and isn&rsquo;t redeemed. Anna could have been betrayed by any other person; Kristoff could have found any other, more character-specific reason to back off from being with Anna.</p>

<h2>In conclusion</h2>

<p>I had a lot of fun watching <em>Frozen</em>, particularly with the ~<em>twist</em>~ of Anna saving herself. And her kiss at the end with Kristoff was such consensual wow! Also, the particle effects were great.</p>
