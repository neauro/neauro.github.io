<h4 class="ls1">Dream Builder: Amusement Park</em> is a casual simulation PC game where players create an amusement park.</h4>
<p>
  As the game's designer, I led a team of one programmer and four artists. I also programmed UI and UI animations, and did project management, including overseeing general scheduling and in-house playtests.

<h5>Player Feedback on <em>Dream Builder</em></h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “This has been a complete joy to play. I own many amusement park building games and usually after awhile I have to take a break but I couldn't stop playing this one. It has SO many different things to it it's hard to understand how someone can stop or dislike it.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “I played this game on a Beta test a month ago, and have been anxiously awaiting the finished product to appear on Big Fish. I was so happy to see it there today. I did the trial hour before buying just to make sure that I liked all the changes that had been made. I was not disappointed. It is a fantastic [time management] Game.”
