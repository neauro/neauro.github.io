With the Republic edging closer to chaos, the two join a group of Patriot rebels eager to help Day rescue his brother and offer passage to the Colonies. They have only one request—June and Day must assassinate the new Elector.<br /><br />It’s their chance to change the nation, to give voice to a people silenced for too long. <br /><br />But as June realizes this Elector is nothing like his father, she’s haunted by the choice ahead. What if Anden is a new beginning? What if revolution must be more than loss and vengeance, anger and blood—what if the Patriots are wrong?<br /><br />In this highly-anticipated sequel, Lu delivers a breathtaking thriller with high stakes and cinematic action.</em></blockquote><br />[spoilers ahead] <br /><br />I finished <em>Prodigy</em> this past weekend, and enjoyed it. June and Day had more distinctive voices, and some of my confusions I had with the <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/10/legend-marie-lu.html">previous book</a> were addressed more clearly here. In particular, the history of the Republic and the Colonies and how they came to be in conflict with each other is finally revealed, and probably for the best in this book, rather than in <em>Legend</em>; I can&#8217;t imagine the needless bulk that would have been in the first book had all that exposition been thrown in there.<br /><br /><em>Prodigy</em>&#8217;s subversions of cliche were fun; just when you think June has no idea she&#8217;s being tricked, she reveals that she knows even more than you do about what&#8217;s going on, with a cleverness that isn&#8217;t eye-rolling. I thought that June and Day&#8217;s role in the rebellion as Beloved of the People was a little boring — <em>Mockingjay</em> was enough exploration of the &#8220;war celebrity&#8221; for me — though June and Day&#8217;s story, despite everything, is a little brighter than Katniss&#8217; battle angst.<br /><br />Overall, the motivations for each character were pretty well-done in <em>Prodigy</em>. I wish there had been a little more pattern to it — for example, at some point Tess asks Day, &#8220;If it were between me and June, who would you save?&#8221; Day answers, and though Day does later make a choice between June and the rebellion, this question made me expect and want a high-stress situation where Day&#8217;s true feelings between Tess and June were pressured out of him.<br /><br /><em>Prodigy</em>! More cheesecake to enjoy. I like the direction it took with making neither side of the Republic/Colonies war ideal — in fact, both sides were pretty repugnant — and I&#8217;m excited to see where the last book will go.</div>

Valente. Now she weaves a lyrically erotic spell of a place where the grotesque and the beautiful reside and the passport to our most secret fantasies begins with a stranger’s kiss.… <br /><br />Between life and death, dreaming and waking, at the train stop beyond the end of the world is the city of Palimpsest. To get there is a miracle, a mystery, a gift, and a curse—a voyage permitted only to those who’ve always believed there’s another world than the one that meets the eye. Those fated to make the passage are marked forever by a map of that wondrous city tattooed on their flesh after a single orgasmic night. To this kingdom of ghost trains, lion-priests, living kanji, and cream-filled canals come four travelers: Oleg, a New York locksmith; the beekeeper November; Ludovico, a binder of rare books; and a young Japanese woman named Sei. They’ve each lost something important—a wife, a lover, a sister, a direction in life—and what they will find in Palimpsest is more than they could ever imagine.</i></blockquote><br />Being terribly hungry for more of Valente&#8217;s writing after reading <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2013/05/deathless-catherynne-valente.html"><em>Deathless</em></a>, I chose <em>Palimpsest</em> to read next due to its focus on a city, a subject I have a weakness for ever since reading China Miéville.<br /><br />All I really have to say about this book is <em>wow</em>. My feedback for it is similar to anything I had to babble about <em>Deathless</em> — excellent, poetic, gorgeous. Like <em>Deathless</em>, though the plot was a little flimsy, I didn&#8217;t mind that much; whereas <em>Deathless</em> was suspended in a fairytale haze that made everything easy to digest, <em>Palimpsest</em> had all the (appropriate) tones of a dreamland, in which things don&#8217;t make utter sense but are all imbued with truth and urgency.<br /><br />Something else I appreciated about this book in particular was the character Amaya Sei. Though I&#8217;m not Japanese myself, I felt that the treatment of Sei as a character was great; she didn&#8217;t sink into stereotypes, she stood up on her own, and overall she was allowed to be a <em>person</em> rather than a caricature. It was also refreshing to read a story with such a variety of characters, diverse unabashedly and without slowing down to explain things: this person is mixed, this person is gay, and so on.<br /><br /><em>Palimpsest</em> was fantastic.</div>

But Koschei has never before been seen through the eyes of Catherynne Valente, whose modernized and transformed take on the legend brings the action to modern times, spanning many of the great developments of Russian history in the twentieth century.<br /><br />Deathless, however, is no dry, historical tome: it lights up like fire as the young Marya Morevna transforms from a clever child of the revolution, to Koschei’s beautiful bride, to his eventual undoing. Along the way there are Stalinist house elves, magical quests, secrecy and bureaucracy, and games of lust and power. All told, Deathless is a collision of magical history and actual history, of revolution and mythology, of love and death, which will bring Russian myth back to life in a stunning new incarnation.</em></blockquote><br /><em>I can&#8217;t even believe that I&#8217;ve never read anything by Catherynne Valente before.</em> Her writing is so gorgeous that I found myself struggling to slow down, to digest every word. True to the reviews on the inside cover, <em>Deathless</em> reads like modern fairytale, and for that reason even the stranger things in the book — Marya&#8217;s scars like tiger stripes, her hair thick as snakes, her &#8220;twelve mothers&#8221; you never quite meet, the palaces she walks of twitching skin — sink and seep in easily, where in a less poetic book they might have instead made me wince. Similarly, things that might have bothered me in other books, I was fine with here. Years transpire believably in paragraphs. We leave Marya and return months later once she has already made friends we don&#8217;t know, which she soon loses and spends the rest of the book crying for. Totally cool with it.<br /><br />I loved Valente&#8217;s use of fairytale-esque repetition, the minimalist exposition and description that was just <em>barely</em> there. It was just the right amount of description to push you off the edge of things, and let the rest of you fly away into a sort of landscape that your own mind painted into her sketches.<br /><br />It occurs to me that this makes it sound as if you have to put a lot of effort into understanding things, but this isn&#8217;t quite the case. Reading Valente&#8217;s writing is like reading Tarot cards. You see the images — fill your mind with them — and all the intricacies come floating up on their own.<br /><br />Does that make sense either? To be honest, there&#8217;s no description I have that can do justice; all I can say is that after reading this book I&#8217;ve become a seriose fan, and have already started for everything else she&#8217;s written.</div>

Garden stuff has been progressing without me writing much about it because recently I am lucky if I can manage to wake up early enough or stay up long enough at home to water anything, much less take photos of it and muse upon its growth. Suffice to say that at the start of spring I went crazy over some on-sale seeds and attempted to plant some in seed starter pots.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HbVoI1I65dc/UZkzqoJegjI/AAAAAAAADmA/xv4ionrdSvE/s1600/pots.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HbVoI1I65dc/UZkzqoJegjI/AAAAAAAADmA/xv4ionrdSvE/s640/pots.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">march pots</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Dragon&#8217;s Tongue Wax Beans in particular looked super cool and exciting and got off to a great start indoors…<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bxXJjsUTwl8/UZk0YNfGEzI/AAAAAAAADmI/c6o1a7VLsEg/s1600/b20cad109e0611e2977522000a9f308b_6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bxXJjsUTwl8/UZk0YNfGEzI/AAAAAAAADmI/c6o1a7VLsEg/s1600/b20cad109e0611e2977522000a9f308b_6.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">lil things</td></tr></tbody></table><br />…but when I transplanted them outside, they didn&#8217;t last two weeks. Maybe I didn&#8217;t harden them off enough? Maybe, like swiss chard, they&#8217;re too delicate to withstand transplanting? When I transplanted them I also planted some new beans, and these happen to be doing really well. Unlike the indoor starts, they have very deep green leaves and thick stems.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BWMd4Y28qBI/UZk0e1u9oNI/AAAAAAAADmQ/0fb0RZ25HP0/s1600/beans.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BWMd4Y28qBI/UZk0e1u9oNI/AAAAAAAADmQ/0fb0RZ25HP0/s640/beans.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">transplants in the back, new beans in the front</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My other surprise is the success of my radishes, which I planted outdoors in March alongside some arugula and swiss chard. Look, they&#8217;re doing it! They&#8217;re really growing!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wlw-8ULdxk0/UZk0mRvdBQI/AAAAAAAADmY/sssd_-6eP5M/s1600/radish.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wlw-8ULdxk0/UZk0mRvdBQI/AAAAAAAADmY/sssd_-6eP5M/s640/radish.jpg" width="480" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">radishes</td></tr></tbody></table><br />They&#8217;re probably the most attractive-looking edible thing I&#8217;ve grown this far, especially since the spinach and swiss chard I started growing before last winter tasted pretty mediocre. My mistake was not staggering out their sowing, however, so I pretty much just have this batch and that&#8217;s it for now.<br /><br />Speaking of the spinach, as soon as the heat started getting up to around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, they started sending up flowers. The plants rise up over my knee now, and their stalks are as thick as my fingers, and it&#8217;s hard to believe that they used to be just little seeds.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nrNtX57556s/UZk01kBXMTI/AAAAAAAADmg/isuH3F_SXMk/s1600/spinach.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nrNtX57556s/UZk01kBXMTI/AAAAAAAADmg/isuH3F_SXMk/s640/spinach.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">biiig spinaches</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My lime tree has really perked up now that the weather has gotten better, though has still suffered from leaves that are pale green and strangely droopy and bendy. They feel almost elastic. Some internet research has uncovered that I, in my passion to not drown it, I may be <em>under watering</em> it. Since being given a couple thorough soaks, the leaves indeed seem a little stiffer and greener. I&#8217;ve also repotted it into something larger and more sturdy than its initial black pot. No flowers or fruit yet, probably because it&#8217;s been stressed and dehydrated for the better part of its life with me.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2K9oGih_FtA/UZk5k9YELFI/AAAAAAAADm8/kUQGMmKcBW4/s1600/lime.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2K9oGih_FtA/UZk5k9YELFI/AAAAAAAADm8/kUQGMmKcBW4/s640/lime.jpg" width="424" /></a></div><br /><br />Speaking of stressed and dehydrated, before the winter started A and I received a very impressive-looking 30 year old jade tree&#8230;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FBtg2WrZ7_0/UZk4kr_GXTI/AAAAAAAADmw/pxyd6OAy_aQ/s1600/JADE.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FBtg2WrZ7_0/UZk4kr_GXTI/AAAAAAAADmw/pxyd6OAy_aQ/s640/JADE.jpg" width="424" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">jade tree on the sunniest part of our house, the laundry room</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was very concerned about killing it, especially since, despite my diligent watering, its leaves began to fall off in gooey yellow curls. Some internet research has uncovered that I, in my passion to not kill it, I was probably <em>over watering</em> it. I&#8217;ve since then toned down and the tree seems okay on its new perch over the dryer. One branch even bloomed little white blossoms! Whoa!<br /><br />My air plants from last year are doing well. In the picture below, the top plant had one pup that is now fairly large, and the bottom actually had two pups, so it&#8217;s getting to be a handful.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ePFiQPKUfGE/UZk6H_Nc0ZI/AAAAAAAADnM/iV_Tzcv5RKk/s1600/DSC_0008.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ePFiQPKUfGE/UZk6H_Nc0ZI/AAAAAAAADnM/iV_Tzcv5RKk/s640/DSC_0008.jpg" width="480" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">spot the pups!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It&#8217;s been about a year since <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/tillandsia-pups.html">I got them at the UW Street Fair</a>, and when the fair rolled around again this weekend I was excited to pick up more! Four more, in fact. I was excited to get ones with weirder tentacle shapes, and then also picked up two teensy blooming ones, one of which already looks like it&#8217;s growing a pup. The two little ones are already a year old and were blooming already, so it makes me a little bewildered about why my plants from last year are not blooming. Maybe I should invest in some fertilizer.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K9mnSDnlg8c/UZk62g87ozI/AAAAAAAADnY/gdU6fXWDE2k/s1600/new+tillandsia.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K9mnSDnlg8c/UZk62g87ozI/AAAAAAAADnY/gdU6fXWDE2k/s640/new+tillandsia.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">spot the pup!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Speaking of plants retrieved at fairs, my sedums are doing okay. The iceplant-looking one is faring the best of all of them. I&#8217;ve moved three of them to a little pot I bought at Daiso and tried to give them succulent soil to see if they would do any better than in normal potting soil, but thus far I don&#8217;t observe any difference.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gxWzNb7CxSk/UZk8esDbULI/AAAAAAAADno/0tJ7GN8_R44/s1600/sedum.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gxWzNb7CxSk/UZk8esDbULI/AAAAAAAADno/0tJ7GN8_R44/s640/sedum.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sedums in a long pot</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Speaking of succulent soil, the reason why I had some is because I got another succulent! I saw it on sale at the hardware store and couldn&#8217;t resist. Donkey/burro tail plants are so neat-looking. Some of the little bean-leaves had detached and fallen between into the dirt inside the pot, so I took them out and placed them in their own pots to see if they might grow into new plants.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NY0YtOmu5JE/UZk8k9hneQI/AAAAAAAADnw/mxgqWYJAGFE/s1600/succulent+tail.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NY0YtOmu5JE/UZk8k9hneQI/AAAAAAAADnw/mxgqWYJAGFE/s640/succulent+tail.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">burro tail on the dryer</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And that&#8217;s (almost) all of what I have growing.</div>

Luckily, we discovered an all-purpose primer at an Ace Hardware which a woman added a gray hue to for us, so that we could achieve the dark black we wanted.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4YYWpCHZBDA/UXnxP06TofI/AAAAAAAADiM/pPOSuj5ro00/s1600/DSC_0211.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4YYWpCHZBDA/UXnxP06TofI/AAAAAAAADiM/pPOSuj5ro00/s640/DSC_0211.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">primer time</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It took a couple months to construct, and about a week to paint, and afterward A edged out the fingers with silver to give it a metallic look.<br /><br />As for the dress…I had this idea that I would eyeball the entire thing, and this would just <em>not work</em> for the lovely back that this costume has. I ended up trying to eyeball the dress twice before resigning myself to crawling the Internet for patterns. Luckily, I found <a href="http://www.briansews.com/2011/07/how-to-y-back-tank-top.html">a really great tutorial</a> on how to make a &#8220;racerback&#8221; tank top, and from there it was pretty easy! (Though still time-consuming.)<br /><br />The collar was made out of a piece of foam, which we covered with black fabric and white felt and secured in the back with a plate of cardboard and some screws. (A&#8217;s touch, which I think is awesome.)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gIuRrFlF6ag/UXnx6IU-0iI/AAAAAAAADiY/lhYJp1yAoPs/s1600/smaller.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="478" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gIuRrFlF6ag/UXnx6IU-0iI/AAAAAAAADiY/lhYJp1yAoPs/s640/smaller.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />The tail was the thing that got thrown under the bus this time, as the deadline neared: that was fashioned somewhat crudely from leftover foam covered in masking tape, painted over in black, and sewn to the back of my biking shorts. The tape slowly unraveled throughout Con, but luckily neither it (or the arms!) broke apart entirely, despite my panicking throughout the weekend.<br /><br />Without further ado, here are photos from my group&#8217;s photoshoot, all taken by the super-talented <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jaymee.masui">Jaymee Masui</a>!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J23HKRd1DIA/UXn1baZL49I/AAAAAAAADjA/CuYZeLMOmsE/s1600/27155_513352652061010_2061205090_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="472" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J23HKRd1DIA/UXn1baZL49I/AAAAAAAADjA/CuYZeLMOmsE/s640/27155_513352652061010_2061205090_n.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">our whole group!</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SGkmfLshdKM/UXn1fuZAX6I/AAAAAAAADjI/3o_KKVMh9rE/s1600/534920_513352595394349_1464377463_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="382" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SGkmfLshdKM/UXn1fuZAX6I/AAAAAAAADjI/3o_KKVMh9rE/s640/534920_513352595394349_1464377463_n.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">&#8220;group hug&#8221;</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-joZwQ1T968Q/UXn1jVyFLOI/AAAAAAAADjQ/UknoWtU7g0A/s1600/733802_513352732061002_890250777_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-joZwQ1T968Q/UXn1jVyFLOI/AAAAAAAADjQ/UknoWtU7g0A/s640/733802_513352732061002_890250777_n.jpg" width="428" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">strength &amp; gold saw, who i am told have a special relationship</td></tr></tbody></table><br />More group photos can be seen at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.513352428727699.1073741826.475899655806310&amp;type=1">Kimidori Cosplay</a>.

Here&#8217;s to many years ahead. ^___^<br /><br />Fun fact: the arms were so heavy that I actually gained non-negligible muscle mass over the course of the weekend…haha.

(What is it like to love someone and then see their body thrown into the back of a garbage truck? <em>Oh God</em>)<br /><br />It’s a story that I would be surprised to find in the US, because despite the fact that the title alludes to the wolf-shapeshifting children, the story is just as much about their mother, Hana, and her struggles to raise the children, aided only by her dead partner’s dwindling savings. She learns about natural birth to avoid going to hospitals; she fights off health inspectors; at some point her daughter accidentally ingests detergent and there’s an amusing scene of her rushing off into the night and then glancing desperately back and forth between a children’s hospital and a pet clinic.<br /><br />Though Hana misses her partner, at no point does she ever really find a replacement for him, or need another man at all. Even when she moves into the countryside, she receives assistance from the entire community there (though there is vaguely tsundere old man involved). Though her partner was a wolfman and is the reason why her children are also partially wolves, he just isn’t a part of the equation after he leaves. It sounds simple, but it’s such a relief that there are stories out there about women persevering, doing their own thing against all odds, and ultimately finding a place where they (and their children) can just be themselves.<br /><br />It’s also just a relief to see a woman who isn’t vilified for being a single mother, who isn’t ultimately viewed as lesser and unwhole for her lack of a man, who loses him and continues to move on with her life. Despite what much media would have you believe, without men, women keep existing and struggling towards their own goals.<br /><br />It&#8217;s true that Hana’s motivations center almost entirely on the health of her children, which on its own isn’t terribly stereotype-breaking, but I appreciated how Hana didn’t lose her personality to become a faceless machine of a mother figure, a character wholly defined by her offspring’s emotions. Her bright attitude could have been unbelievable, but was acceptable to me because it is something established as a defining trait: &#8220;Even at my father’s funeral I laughed.&#8221; And even so, it doesn’t mean she’s perfect: she often admits her ignorance (and remedies it thoroughly researching all her problems), she cries, she bandages her fingers, she panics, and rubs her back when it aches. You also get a glimpse of Hana&#8217;s life as it was before motherhood, and a little &#8220;after,&#8221; once her children have embarked <br /><br />And now that all of that is said — though <em>Wolf Children</em> impressed me with its focus on Hana as a single mother, after talking about this movie with Heather, I learned that the &#8220;virtuous mother&#8221; is actually a trope not uncommon in Eastern narratives. I haven&#8217;t noticed it much, but will definitely be keeping an eye on it from now on.</div>

I tried using <a href="http://lift.do/">Lift</a> for a while. Having read <a href="http://zenhabits.net/sticky/">ZenHabit</a>&#8217;s encouragement that the way to start a habit is by just <em>starting</em>, even if it&#8217;s a little bit at a time, I thought Lift would be a good (and pretty) way to keep myself accountable. I rearranged my iPod home screen, putting it on my front page&#8217;s top row. I dutifully added three habits that I wanted to keep track of: getting exercise, writing, and more writing.<br /><br />Two things broke Lift for me.<br /><br /><strong>First — You can&#8217;t go back to previous days to mark what habits you did, but didn&#8217;t mark that day.</strong> Or maybe you can, and I just couldn&#8217;t figure out how? In any case, I have an iPod — I&#8217;m not connected to the internet through it every day — and stressing myself out by making sure I log into Lift at least once a day is something I&#8217;m not willing or happy to burden my completionist personality with.<br /><br /><strong>Second — ultimately, Lift isn&#8217;t meaningful enough to me.</strong> Though I&#8217;m working on getting both exercise and writing time, actually doing those things is the feel-good reward, and Lift doesn&#8217;t add to these feelings in any interesting way. Even with Tiny Tower, logging in once a day to mindlessly tap things gives you, eventually, an impressive tower. All Lift could do for me was represent my taps as a series of colored bars and occasionally send some canned inspirational e-mails.<br /><br />On a side note, it is fun to read Lift&#8217;s blog and see data compiled about people&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.lift.do/post/40128965086/infographic-your-goals-in-2013">2013 goals</a>, or other ways that people are using <a href="http://blog.lift.do/post/42988396863/lift-tip-rewards-for-good-habits">extrinsic awards</a> to keep themselves sticking to habits that I think are easy to justify yourself out of, such as not staying late at work.</div>

Yeah! It does make me wonder about the life cycle of this sort of app though. It seems to make itself obsolete by the success of its users (assuming success is defined by gaining intrinsic happiness). Then again, I suppose you could say that about a lot of things (like dating sites :P).</div>

If you&#39;ve gotten started and now actually doing your habits is your reward, then I&#39;d say you probably don&#39;t need Lift at this point anyway. :)</div>

I&#8217;ve recently started using <a href="http://www.trello.com">Trello</a> to keep track of my myriad projects, and I love it because I can use it as an always-accessible repository of lists for ideas regarding games, writing, websites, homework, and so on. It&#8217;s also great for keeping track of resources like free icon sets. I&#8217;ve also been using it to manage and focus on what things are actually currently on my plate, and making sure I don&#8217;t overextend myself.<br /><br />My prime reading time has always been during my commutes, but I have been reading less because I&#8217;ve discovered <a href="">IA Writer</a>, a writing app which features a simple UI, a re-arranged keyboard, and integration with iCloud (which took me forever how to use; but it&#8217;s way more convenient than e-mailing myself everything). I absolutely adore it and have been using it for writing practice, which has in general alleviated my plaguing anxieties about not writing enough. I tried writing on the bus with my sketchbook but the bus&#8217;s movement made my scribbles illegible; typing on my iPod makes things easier, and even a little fun.<br /><br />I have also been hard at work on my part of this year&#8217;s group cosplay, Black Rock Shooter. I was initially going to go for Demon Cannon User, but then a friend dropped out due to busy-ness, and now I&#8217;m rocking Strength, for which I am actually attempting to build up strength to carry around the huge cardboard hands that A is helping me make.<br /><br />Winter quarter is also in full swing. This quarter I&#8217;m taking my first &#8220;practical&#8221; class, usability testing, and it&#8217;s funny — I always thought that I would find practical classes more immediately applicable — but instead I&#8217;m finding myself missing theory courses, where you could learn a theory and apply it <em>immediately</em>, instead of waiting to gather participants and test. I&#8217;m working with a group to improve and analyze the usability of <a href="http://www.mappingvoices.org">Mapping Voices</a>, which I was interested in for the potential application of game design — for example, how can you encourage people to take action against health inequity? How can you make people feel productive taking action?<br /><br />Though it looks like our suggestions will have to hold up against a bureaucracy and generally complicated organization, I&#8217;m looking forward to contributing to a local organization!</div>

But when her life becomes intertwined with the handsome Prince Kai’s, she suddenly finds herself at the center of an intergalactic struggle, and a forbidden attraction. Caught between duty and freedom, loyalty and betrayal, she must uncover secrets about her past in order to protect her world’s future.</em></blockquote><br />I just finished reading <em>Cinder</em> by Marissa Meyer and absolutely loved it, and am still trying to figure out why. It came with recommendations from some friends and Tumblr, whose endorsement loosened my fear that a &#8220;New Beijing&#8221; setting would be filled with all manner of gross exotifications a la <a href="http://beyondvictoriana.com/2010/02/13/beyond-victoriana-14-the-wind-up-girl-guest-review-by-jaymee-goh/">other future Asia books</a>. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t!<br /><br />I wavered a little when the love interest, Prince <strike>Charming</strike> Kai was introduced; off the bat he is introduced as having &#8220;copper-colored&#8221; eyes and a plethora of shrieking fangirls (really). Though I still could have done without the fangirls, Prince Kai on his own was fine — more than a love interest with swoon-inducing eyes, a perfectly tortured too-young politician with bangs and occasional sad gazes and statements. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he says at some point, &#8220;I guess I really should give up my life for my people :&#8217;(&#8221;<br /><br />(Sometimes this is exactly what I want. This is one of those times.)<br /><br />Cinder herself is a great cyborg. She isn&#8217;t just furnished with metal parts, she <em>is</em> them. She notes when her software tells her people lying; she escapes embarrassing moments due to her inability to blush; her moments of panic are accompanied by suggestions that she take deep breaths to decrease heightened levels of adrenaline. If there&#8217;s anything else I wanted out of this story&#8217;s cyborgness, it&#8217;s more of a reason why cyborgs are hated; at some point her stepmother snaps that Cinder can&#8217;t really feel anything, can she, but this just doesn&#8217;t seem reason enough for a society-deep fear and disdain. Maybe if there had been some big incident that made everything cling to and guard their own humanity as something they cherished, &#8220;true&#8221; emotions and all? (Maybe if this incident was related to the Luna?)<br /><br />One of the story&#8217;s Big Twists is something easy to call from the first 50 pages. Though I was tempted to feel disdained, after reading <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2013/01/books-of-2012.html">Wired for Story</a> and its mantra that &#8220;reads love to find delight in figuring out what&#8217;s going on!&#8221; I&#8217;m giving it a second thought. After all, it <em>is</em> pretty fun to know the secret from the beginning — to see Cinder dodge it — to know what&#8217;s really going on.<br /><br />Another aspect of this story that&#8217;s pretty cool is the amount of <em>stuff</em> going on — Cinder&#8217;s tension with her family, Cinder&#8217;s mysterious past, Cinder&#8217;s being hated as a cyborg, the soon-to-be-emperor, the psychic aliens, the plague. For the most part, however, all of these things were all tied together and impact Cinder and the events in the story.<br /><br />Ultimately, <em>Cinder</em> was a fantastic story about a character who gets disadvantaged and broken up again and again and continues to persevere and stick to her principles.<br /><br />[ spoilers ]<br /><br />That being said, I do wish that the Big Twist — that Cinder is Princess <strike>Serena</strike> Selene of the moon — had been played with a little more. For example, the character Dr. Erland clearly knows Cinder&#8217;s secret, and persists in lying to her about it, and this serves as a shallow obstacle, since there&#8217;s nothing about Dr. Erland that makes you suspect him or his motives. So he&#8217;s lying to Cinder — so what? It isn&#8217;t affecting anything, she isn&#8217;t going to be hurt by it. Imagine instead of Dr. Erland were more sinister — if you knew he knew Cinder&#8217;s identity, and if every time Cinder entered the room with him you were crying for her to just get out of there before something awful happened — that would have been <i>great</i>.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Last year was pretty great, in terms of learning more about what sort of things I&#8217;m capable of, and navigating the bewildering world of (un)employment and health insurance. In 2012, I finally started earning a salary, health insurance, and a 401k at my &#8220;dream job,&#8221; and two months later was laid off —freed, so to speak, from my decade-long devotion to being a game designer. To be honest, the fact that I will never spend my life thinking <em>What if I had just pursued my dream</em> is an odd gift that I never would have expected to receive and am very thankful for.<br /><br />(Which isn&#8217;t to say that I&#8217;ve given up on making games! Though, with all the other stuff that I want to do and learn about recently, I also can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m completely devoted to it anymore either.)<br /><br />Recently I&#8217;ve been trying to focus on making the most of every day, rather than thinking about how I can influence things way in the future, and for that reason I wasn&#8217;t too inspired to make a particular resolution for this year. However, I would like to try and get one draft of a looong story done this year, and now that I&#8217;ve settled into more a more permanent residence and have gotten into the swing of full-time employment and graduate school, I think that such a goal is more within reach :)<br /><br />My other obvious goal is to have a dog, but between the aforementioned work and school I think that will end up being a resolution for a later year!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BroUUBWsEMQ/UOnuq0fFp-I/AAAAAAAAC_g/V25GuYgJeLM/s1600/5994955277_d230103497.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BroUUBWsEMQ/UOnuq0fFp-I/AAAAAAAAC_g/V25GuYgJeLM/s1600/5994955277_d230103497.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">soon, my sweet</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
