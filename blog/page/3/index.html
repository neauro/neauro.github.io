And weirdness! And mysteriousness!</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Spoilers ahead.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>1.</h2></div><div class="p1">One of my favorite parts of adventure games is the characterization that rises through interaction with items. Do characters like a certain item, or dislike it? Does the item bring up deep heartbroken memories of the past? How do they parse and react, and what does their rumination say for who they are? I&#8217;m reminded of Nancy Drew&#8217;s endearing enthusiasm for lifting up random objects (&#8220;This plastic DNA model will be useful!&#8221;) and Phoenix Wright&#8217;s skeptical amusement when things like puppies are added to his inventory.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The most interesting item in the game for me was the toy cat, which I enjoyed petting all the time to accrue invisible &#8220;sanity&#8221; points. Engaging with the cat toy in particular puts you in the shoes and brain of the lone survivor himself, tinkering with a plush at the end of the world, just to have something light-hearted to do.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>2.</h2></div><div class="p1">Speaking of the cat plush, I loved the detail of this game — the unidentifiable flesh-like substances stretching across the wall — the way your map was dark unless you viewed it under sources of light — the specific food items like Delicious Ham, the creepy bottomless repositories of pills and Rotten Meats.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>3.</h2></div><div class="p1">A criticism of <i>Lone Survivor</i> seems to be that it was not scary enough. I played it at the height of summer and even then it was plenty terrifying, even if most of my stress and fear stemmed from being unable to hoard my bullets as obsessively as I would have liked.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Another scary part: putting your hand in that horrifying pink-red flesh-pixel hole. I <i>really </i>did not want to do that.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>4.</h2></div><div class="p1">The dream sequences were cool, and the characters therein intriguingly surreal, which I loved. Ultimately, however, I didn&#8217;t feel that these scenes contributed to a larger understanding of what was going on, which was disappointing. Rather than deep, the first ending I received was vague, and a letdown. After carrying and caring for this dude I&#8217;d wanted a little more than a whiff of a broken heart. I wanted to know more about what this girl meant to the protagonist, how her departure left his life with zombie-filled corridors.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>5.</h2></div><div class="p1">I got my ending by playing as paragon as possible. I wanted to see if other endings would give me closure, so I found them on Youtube. Each one seemed vaguer than the last, and didn&#8217;t interest me that much. I don&#8217;t have a particular love of multiple endings and for me it&#8217;s because they lack impact: I&#8217;ve only rarely encountered any set that comfortably resolves all issues and tension introduced in the game, and the way that such endings are reached never quite seems to match the decisions you made to get there.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">In the case of <i>Lone Survivor, </i>the decisions that you make add to an invisible calculator which eventually spits out one of these endings: for example, killing more monsters gives you endings that imply you&#8217;re mentally unstable. But why? What is it about killing these things makes you this way? The worst ending can also be achieved not just by killing monsters, but &#8220;eating food when not hungry or hurt&#8221; and &#8220;sleeping for no reason&#8221; (per <a href="http://lonesurvivor.wikia.com/wiki/Endings">this wiki</a>). What&#8217;s <i>that </i>connection?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>6.</h2></div><div class="p1">This was my other favorite part: getting that white cat to come live with me. I guess it&#8217;s strange to be saying that after my demands for meaningfulness, since other than the invisible points, hanging out with the cat doesn&#8217;t reveal any more of the protagonist&#8217;s inner story. But playing with the cat, I felt for the first time that I was doing something in the game that I personally wanted, like it was really <i>me</i> in there, and not me poking through things in a dude-shaped glove.<br /><br />Come here! Come <i>here</i>, little digital thing!<br /><br /></div><div class="p1"><i>come and be with me forever</i><br /><i><br /></i><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tvhPIy5tDo/UilDcBOQcrI/AAAAAAAAEBc/f6aLd4GxHlk/s1600/Sunny.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tvhPIy5tDo/UilDcBOQcrI/AAAAAAAAEBc/f6aLd4GxHlk/s1600/Sunny.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://lonesurvivor.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><i><br /></i></div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I loved <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/10/bastion-logtistical-est.html">Bastion</a> and I&#8217;m super super super excited for <i>Transistor</i>, because it has a female protagonist with curly hair. <i>Curly hair!</i><br /><br />(Or at the very least, <i>wavy hair!</i>)<br /><br />I was not keen on attending PAX this year until I found a friend selling tickets and my compulsion to hoard scarce resources broke through my skepticism of the event. I first went in 2009 and stopped out of boredom and <a href="http://debacle.tumblr.com/">discomfort</a>, but decided I&#8217;d give this year another try, not because I think trivializing rape is okay (I <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/genesis-2.html">don&#8217;t</a>) but because I wanted to see if the environment has changed since <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2013/06/full-ign-interview-with-anita-sarkeesian/">Tropes Vs Women</a>. I also really, really, <i>really</i> wanted to see <i>Transistor</i>.<br /><br />Since I got my tickets late, I started cosplay work only about a month before PAX started, which also happened to be right in the swing of summer quarter. Making the sword was fun and challenging, mostly because it was my first time working with plastic. First I made some sketches and then a model using some leftover foam from my <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2013/04/sakura-con-2013-cosplay-black-rock.html">Strength cosplay</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uP3HTT7dTS4/Uif_sQSC7DI/AAAAAAAAD-s/487Li4QQ4lc/s1600/sketch.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="482" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uP3HTT7dTS4/Uif_sQSC7DI/AAAAAAAAD-s/487Li4QQ4lc/s640/sketch.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">such cosplay wow</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then I visited <a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/">TAP Plastics</a> and after beating around the bush I admitted that I was making a giant sword. Turns out the guy staffing was also a cosplayer and happy to give me advice, which I desperately needed. I had my heart set on a blue-y transparent plastic, which they didn&#8217;t have, but he explained that if I painted on the backside of clear plastic, <em>it would look like a mirror</em>…and that sounded great! I got a couple samples of green-edge acrylic and tried out a couple different paint colors on it.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lo5wfmiMpD4/Uif_5u8R3wI/AAAAAAAAD-0/S4caFilJwac/s1600/paint+test.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="290" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lo5wfmiMpD4/Uif_5u8R3wI/AAAAAAAAD-0/S4caFilJwac/s640/paint+test.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i was so bright-eyed then</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A pointed out that what would really make the sword striking would be a strong contrast between the base color and &#8220;solder lines,&#8221; so for the base color I decided on using a lot of green to really make the inner lines stand out.<br /><br />Then I visited TAP Plastics to get the pieces cut, and at the last moment decided I wanted not just half an inch thickness of plastic, but a whole inch. Imagine my shock and horror when I realized that such a width of plastic is actually heavy. Like, <em>really</em> heavy. (I don&#8217;t have a scale, but a friend&#8217;s estimate when he picked up the final product and grimaced was 35 lbs, so I&#8217;m going with that number.)<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8SxFDzB53F0/UigAxKgvILI/AAAAAAAAD-8/e-Q0WPJRfeA/s1600/heavy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="531" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8SxFDzB53F0/UigAxKgvILI/AAAAAAAAD-8/e-Q0WPJRfeA/s640/heavy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">heavy, but still not as unwieldy as strength arms</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My plan was to do a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_glass_painting">reverse painting</a> deal on both sides of the sword and then sandwich them together. I used masking tape to copy out my drawn pattern on both sides, and first painted in the solder lines with a mixture of paints: pearly blue, shiny white, and glow-in-the-dark!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eD85Y44KYCU/UigDLfD2H_I/AAAAAAAAD_Q/sqjs_uu_nhI/s1600/painting.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eD85Y44KYCU/UigDLfD2H_I/AAAAAAAAD_Q/sqjs_uu_nhI/s640/painting.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">left photo courtesy of <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I didn&#8217;t get to see the glow paint in action, unfortunately, and the fact that it&#8217;s sort of thick and grainy made me nervous that the plastic pieces would stick together properly when pressed together.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HOuHj5pMteQ/UigFL3SxDwI/AAAAAAAAD_c/pxT8F5MNiZI/s1600/peel+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="478" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HOuHj5pMteQ/UigFL3SxDwI/AAAAAAAAD_c/pxT8F5MNiZI/s640/peel+montage.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">peeling the tape off was <i>so satisfying</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I had two circular pieces of plastic that I wanted to attach to the outside of the sword for the Transistor&#8217;s red &#8220;eye,&#8221; but there&#8217;s also a sort of depression/border around the eye. I realized that in my limited time I wouldn&#8217;t be able to do anything three-dimensional for that border, so I decided to just paint another blue circle.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kei6SIadyXw/UigHA-lNSkI/AAAAAAAAD_o/yicAVzmckIU/s1600/circle.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="489" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kei6SIadyXw/UigHA-lNSkI/AAAAAAAAD_o/yicAVzmckIU/s640/circle.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dry dry dry! (also there&#8217;s A, because i need another picture to even this out)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Meanwhile, the eye got the same &#8220;reverse painting&#8221; treatment.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yemSRp3_suM/UigH1_cWiEI/AAAAAAAAD_w/GZqDWc-Bgcg/s1600/eye+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yemSRp3_suM/UigH1_cWiEI/AAAAAAAAD_w/GZqDWc-Bgcg/s640/eye+montage.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i see you</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Once the solder lines were done, I combined green-y metallic paint and blue metallic paint and painted that down across both pieces.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WPj04DrWiJ0/UigIDnuiGtI/AAAAAAAAEAA/CsjwKL-x1eA/s1600/base+color.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WPj04DrWiJ0/UigIDnuiGtI/AAAAAAAAEAA/CsjwKL-x1eA/s640/base+color.jpg" width="425" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">such contrast</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Since I was swamped with making the actual costume, A helped out with the handle and cutting out what we referred to as the &#8220;top fins&#8221; and &#8220;side fins&#8221; from plywood. Because the plastic turned out to be so heavy, and because we were pressed for time, we left the handle rectangular, rather than shaved down to the canon cylinder.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AOFidkP7444/UigIgs5iDyI/AAAAAAAAEAI/U6O5SE2-dQ0/s1600/DSC_0275.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AOFidkP7444/UigIgs5iDyI/AAAAAAAAEAI/U6O5SE2-dQ0/s640/DSC_0275.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">plywood fins</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After that, with his father&#8217;s help, A and I clamped the two pieces together in a vise and drilled holes through the wood and plastic! Again not canon, but the pieces were <em>such heavy wow, </em>and needed that extra reinforcement.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ36fytFm70/UigJlaSW8uI/AAAAAAAAEAU/4XrID4GWUV4/s1600/drill+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ36fytFm70/UigJlaSW8uI/AAAAAAAAEAU/4XrID4GWUV4/s640/drill+montage.jpg" width="508" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so close!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After drilling, we had planned to take the sword apart and touch up the paint a bit, but…after all the clamping, the two pieces of plastic ended up <em>completely stuck together</em>. So much for worrying about it coming apart.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lFnXTGExgtY/UigJylAc8dI/AAAAAAAAEAc/CemsLFy3qgo/s1600/plywood.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lFnXTGExgtY/UigJylAc8dI/AAAAAAAAEAc/CemsLFy3qgo/s640/plywood.jpg" width="424" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the light does cool shading tricks through the plastic</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The last thing to be built was the pommel, which A flashed out overnight. I have no pictures of it, but it was made out of some plastic canisters and a plastic soysauce dish hot-glued together and painted over. Cosplay at its finest. :&#8217;)<br /><br />Finally, what was left was to paint the plywood pieces, and then glue on the red eye. A also put on some electrical tape to make the side fins appear more indented, but the tape near-immediately fell off during peace-bonding.

I wanted to sew the jacket as well but ran out of time and ended up compromising by sewing a satin triangle to a long black jacket I found at a consignment store a couple days before PAX. The last thing I did was the feather collar, which I made by sewing feathers into leftover Strength felt and sewing it around the dress&#8217;s neck.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v5pXoNDFlwg/UigLYHBNKzI/AAAAAAAAEAs/YCIBxAQnyKw/s1600/DSC_0293.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v5pXoNDFlwg/UigLYHBNKzI/AAAAAAAAEAs/YCIBxAQnyKw/s640/DSC_0293.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">feathers!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />On the day before PAX I also quicked out the triangular ring from Sculpey (also left over from Strength cosplay; thank goodness I can reuse so much stuff) and acrylic paint.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TsVv3uZLfkA/UigL1ImNGlI/AAAAAAAAEA0/6du08qR3d88/s1600/IMG_6350+copy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TsVv3uZLfkA/UigL1ImNGlI/AAAAAAAAEA0/6du08qR3d88/s640/IMG_6350+copy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">photo by <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Sooo overall…though there are a couple things I want to re-do for the next round (including remaking the feather collar and ring), I finished a new cosplay and am proud of my new forays into the world of plastic! PAX itself was fun in and of itself; I was really happy to finally play Transistor, and even more excited for it once I actually played and recognized all the programming nods. I was a little bewildered by the inclusion of the &#8220;stop time and attack&#8221; thing, until I realized it was <em>so thematic</em> — since the Transistor&#8217;s atacks are sort of like methods, &#8220;stopping time&#8221; to queue up attacks and execute them really mirrors compiling programs. <i>Uwaaa.</i><br /><br />I was also surprised and happy to see so many cool Reds at PAX, many of whom had taken the extra leap to use ~*electricity*~! I briefly ran into the Red from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Breakers-Cosplay/419407924815813">Breakers Cosplay</a> who was super impressive and inspiring. I also met a lot of progressive dudes and women who specifically talked about how awesome it is to have A Female Protagonist in a game (something I don&#8217;t think I would have <em>never</em> heard anyone say flat-out in years past), and a lot of friendly people in general who gamely attempted holding my Transistor and remarked at how they admired my ridiculousness for carrying it around all day at the convention, haha. To be fair, my arms were really sore afterward, but all my rock climbing callouses helped out quite a bit!<br /><br />My favorite moment in all of PAX was to meet Jen Zee, who was so awesome and kind and asked for pictures in which I tried desperately to look cool despite my euphoria. She also gave me a ton of Supergiant swag that I placed all around my house immediately. :&#8217;)<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uIlReuprg1U/UigMVP6jKFI/AAAAAAAAEA8/kw8k9oCPExI/s1600/DSC_0306.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uIlReuprg1U/UigMVP6jKFI/AAAAAAAAEA8/kw8k9oCPExI/s1600/DSC_0306.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i christen thee, supergiant wall</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There was also a magical instant where A and I, passing curiously by the Paramount, suddenly realized that Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett were performing and dashed inside as quickly as possible and caught <i>the Transistor song</i>!<br /><br />All this being said, I had a great weekend, mostly due to the friends and people I was able to meet. I don&#8217;t think I feel comfortable enough to return again (because <a href="http://shoshanakessock.com/2013/09/04/pax-youve-gone-and-done-it-an-open-letter/">reasons</a>), but I am thankful for my personal experience this year.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CWR-fH-wYac/UigQ5IFyy7I/AAAAAAAAEBI/GzPz6mXRg3s/s1600/1240322_10151588009897060_1663051843_n_1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="534" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CWR-fH-wYac/UigQ5IFyy7I/AAAAAAAAEBI/GzPz6mXRg3s/s640/1240322_10151588009897060_1663051843_n_1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">especially for time runnin around with <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a>!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And finally, now that both my summer quarter classes and PAX are completely finished, I am free!<br /><br />…and ready to devote myself to a new project!

Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by giants. Giants are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source.

<div class="p1">I&#8217;m unenthusiastic when it comes to designing websites for small screens like phones, probably because I don&#8217;t have a smartphone. (No particular reason why — just that my 6-year-old palm-sized brick of a phone is sturdy and unexciting to steal, and I plan on staying with it as long as it stays with me.)</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a>&nbsp;is what I&#8217;ve been learning recently; it is a &#8220;mobile framework&#8221; and &#8220;HTML5-based user interface system,&#8221; which means that you can</div><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1">stick it in your project</li><li class="li1">throw in some common &#8220;mobile&#8221; UI elements like headers and buttons, or even switches</li><li class="li1">have those buttons be styled to look pretty good already!</li></ul><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Function-wise, you can also use jQuery Mobile to</div><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><a href="http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/pages/page-transitions.html">transition very prettily between pages and dialog boxes</a></li><li class="li1">easily support <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4176844/can-someone-explain-the-html5-aria-attribute">ARIA attributes</a>&nbsp;for better accessibility across your UI elements</li></ul><br />jQuery mobile was confusing for me at first because I would write simple markup, but when viewing it online, my bare elements would suddenly have tons upon tons of classes — a div with a class of <code>mobile-header</code>, for example, would suddenly be a div with the classes <code>mobile-header ui-header ui-bar-a</code>, and would also have a <code>data-role="header"</code> as well. Links in my <code>mobile-header</code> would have also been transformed into elements with tons of classes: <code>icon ui-btn-left ui-btn ui-btn-up-a ui-shadow ui-btn-corner-all</code>…<br /><br /><div class="p1">Which brings me to my next point about jQuery Mobile: it is a <i>pain</i> to style into your theme. Because elements can be so deeply nested, it&#8217;s hard to figure out what exactly is making all of my links black when they should be blue, and so on. Trying to make a link blue may require that you overwrite not just one style but two. jQuery provides a <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/index.php">theme roller</a>&nbsp;which you can use to change the default black style downloaded in the package, but as the things I want to make are radically different than the rounded, chrome buttons they offer, a theme roller doesn&#8217;t help much.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Regarding getting started, I found that <a href="http://thehungrycoder.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/jquery-mobile-part-1-making-your-first-mobile-page.html">this blog post</a>&nbsp;and the ones following were quite helpful. Additionally, this link on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bryanrieger/rethinking-the-mobile-web-by-yiibu">Rethinking the mobile web</a>&nbsp;is a great primer on why developing for the mobile web is important (despite all my eye-rolling/teeth-gnashing) and gives data and another perspective on &#8220;mobile-first&#8221; design processes.</div></div>

For my birthday weekend (some month ago now), I went all-out and scoured my hometown until I found the last remaining Animal Crossing Nintendo 3DS bundle, tucked away in the back of the Toys R Us game section.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I&#8217;ve never played an Animal Crossing game and have to admit that the lack of farming bewildered me. <i>What? How can I really enjoy personalizing and caring for my world if I&#8217;m not diligently watering radishes every day? </i>Even when I started, I doubted I would really enjoy playing such a weird-looking human (the eyes too bright; the lower eyelashes so long!) rather than a cool, adorable animal. I started playing and suddenly it was two and a half hours later, exactly. (I know because of the 3DS Activity Log.)</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">So, what <i>is </i>compelling? For me, it&#8217;s the exploration: being new to the franchise, every swing of the net or fishing pole in the first couple weeks brought me something new and cool to look at, and I imagine this capitalistic wandering is something like what my childhood would have been like if I had been a boy, or allowed outside to play and examine the foliage around my house. Though I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll exhaust the novelty at some point, there&#8217;s also, like Harvest Moon, a sense of <i>ichigo ichie </i>that brings a preciousness even to the cicadas that are fucking everywhere, just because they&#8217;ll only be here until about mid-September or so — and then I&#8217;ll have brand new things to check out.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><i>New Leaf </i>also does a fantastic job of connecting you to other people, in part through the capabilities of the 3DS, which I&#8217;ve never appreciated until now. Through the camera, you can share and import designs that other people have made, pixel-art style, including outfits from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-leaf/QR_Codes">Attack on Titan and Zelda</a> games and paths you can lay down to mimic having more&nbsp;<a href="http://newleafpatterns.tumblr.com/post/55173572156">water</a> in your town.</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">Additionally, entire towns or houses can be shared through the &#8220;Dreamsuite&#8221; or through Streetpass; the former I&#8217;ve used to visit some uncomfortably terrifying towns (such as the infamous Aika and Hitokui), and the latter I&#8217;m excited to use each night when I get back home, perusing the homes of people I&#8217;ve passed throughout the day and hoping for good furniture to hoard for rooms I don&#8217;t have yet. (Thus far I have both a &#8220;backyard&#8221; room and a &#8220;kaitenzushi and pastry restaurant&#8221; room planned…)</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4XJdiXu1r8c/Uec75b8J2QI/AAAAAAAADt8/iDV0OAEbbpw/s1600/HNI_0087.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4XJdiXu1r8c/Uec75b8J2QI/AAAAAAAADt8/iDV0OAEbbpw/s1600/HNI_0087.JPG" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">hito in&#8230;hitokui @__@<br />(&#8220;kui&#8221; means &#8220;to eat&#8221;)</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">Part of this novelty is the 3DS&#8217;s Streetpass itself — my digital headnod at the three people I Streetpass every morning on the bus — and part of it is just the weird delight of meeting people backward and inside-out — knowing, for example, that a fellow commuter is a strict interior designer and Nintendo fan (as shown by their vivid prize room), or that another also loves Attack on Titan (as shown by their &#8220;Scouting Legion&#8221; painting), before I know either of their names or genders.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I&#8217;m not too much of a social gamer — I don&#8217;t like playing competitively, and prefer to play games when I am completely alone — but I appreciate this variety of socialness, or rather not-aloneness, a way to get to interact with and get to know people in a low-stress, low-troll atmosphere.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I&#8217;ve started reserving&nbsp;<a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/">my Tumblr</a> for more &#8220;slice of life&#8221; updates and it&#8217;s there that you can find more <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/acnl">screenshots of my Shiba adventures</a>, as well as my encounters with my villagers, who are acquiring quite the vocabulary.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gxj-vKhwHM8/Uec6tGQ5r7I/AAAAAAAADtw/GsYAGZyo68M/s1600/tumblr_moxg28e8Tq1qdycalo1_400.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gxj-vKhwHM8/Uec6tGQ5r7I/AAAAAAAADtw/GsYAGZyo68M/s1600/tumblr_moxg28e8Tq1qdycalo1_400.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Julian is my favorite villager</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he has dreams. His ability to connect with the outside world is limited to a few grunted syllables, but his inner life is deep, full of wonder and longing.<br /><br />After experiencing a teenage boy&#8217;s memories while consuming his brain, R makes an unexpected choice that begins a tense, awkward, and strangely sweet relationship with the victim&#8217;s human girlfriend. Julie is a blast of color in the otherwise dreary and gray landscape that surrounds R. His choice to protect her will transform not only R, but his fellow Dead, and perhaps their whole lifeless world.<br /><br />Scary, funny, and surprisingly poignant, Warm Bodies explores what happens when the cold heart of a zombie is tempted by the warmth of human love.</i></blockquote><br />I read <em>Warm Bodies</em>&nbsp;a couple weekends ago and it was positively delightful. Every other page I was waving my arms in A&#8217;s direction and begging him to listen to me read aloud. &#8220;Zombie romance&#8221; does seem to be the next logical step after &#8220;vampire romance&#8221; and &#8220;werewolf romance,&#8221; but I never thought it would be this fun.<br /><br />[spoilers ahead] <br /><br />The only thing that fell flat for me was the character of Julie, who wavered a little too far on the side of the Dreaded Manic Pixie Dream Girl for me, and her quirks — keeping a wall in her room for &#8220;the future,&#8221; adopting a nickname of &#8220;Julie Cabernet&#8221; instead of &#8220;Julie Grigio&#8221; — were not just &#8220;meh,&#8221; but also didn&#8217;t contribute noticeably to the plot. The fact that she came to be considered as So Important to the healing of zombies by the book&#8217;s end also wavered uncomfortably on Mary Sue-ness.<br /><br />Other than that, <em>Warm Bodies</em> was tons of fun. Marion&#8217;s detail on the &#8220;culture&#8221; of zombies — the way years pass in a haze, the way some zombies become skeletal &#8220;Boneys,&#8221; the way hunger resonates through their cells and how they are sated only with living brains and flashes of memory — were fantastic. So too were the little details of his world&#8217;s apocalypse: the way some people miss the sound of airplanes, for example, or the way that stadiums have been disemboweled and remade into gigantic slums. Marion&#8217;s writing is also super poignant in illustrating the typical un-life of a zombie.<br /><br /><blockquote><em>There is a chasm between me and the world outside of me. A gap so wide my feelings can&#8217;t cross it. By the time my screams reach the other side, they have dwindled into groans.</em></blockquote><br />I was surprised to learn there are even more <em>Warm Bodies</em> books, and though I felt this first volume ended on a pretty satisfying note, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get to the others eventually.</div>

Suffice to say that processed foods are achieved through an incredible amount of user testing and design, the results of which understands so deeply the heart and chemical of human desire that game designs would probably blush if they could.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">For example, did you know that Doritos can be made without the powder coating your fingers, and taste exactly the same — but that the manufacturers keep Doritos with the powder because they view it as part of the &#8220;experience&#8221; of eating Doritos? I am skeptical, but impressed by the idea.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Both books touch on how processed food conquered kitchens under the weakened defenses of working, busy parents. <i>Salt Sugar Fat </i>was an in-depth view on these ingredients and their uses through the industry; <i>Pandora&#8217;s Lunchbox </i>touched on these as well, but also explored trends like the use of soybeans in Everything, and research on the benefits of whole foods versus processed foods.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">For example, did you know that a Japanese study fed two groups of rats food that was nutritionally identical, but one group got &#8220;normal&#8221; hard pellets and one received &#8220;puffed&#8221; pellets (like puffed cereal)? The rats that received &#8220;puffed&#8221; pellets ended up gaining a significant amount of weight over the other rats! Potentially because food calories are partially used in actually breaking down that food, and foods that are processed take up less calories to break down, in addition to allowing sugars and starches to enter the bloodstream more quickly than the body may be able to handle.</div><br /><div class="p1">Rather than being wholly disgusted by processed foods, I find myself weirdly more interested and fascinated by them and the fact that their taste and texture has been so incredibly optimized for my body.<br /><br />I&#8217;m also way more enthusiastic for farmer&#8217;s markets than I was before. To prove it, here&#8217;s a photo of my new arpakasso with some potatoes I obtained last Saturday!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/8918019794/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sXthaSc3jMg/Ua1iAUW4gPI/AAAAAAAADrk/hmqw405b354/s640/tumblr_mnqmyiw6Dz1qdycalo4_500.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i named him &#8220;babbu&#8221;</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I recommend both books to people who have an interest in food as well as an interest in what can make humans enjoy things perhaps more than they should.</div></div>

While it gathered its strength, refugees and wrens came between the seams of obsidian to erect homes strung like beads between wires and bridges: a necklace of a town, a veil on the sky-staring bride.<br /><br />Because of the earth’s longing, they say, things happen here not by science but by intention, and the citizens are fluent in the tongue of symbols. They set their calendars not to the sun or moon, but to the shadows of wrens whose flocks the wind sings into staffs and blots. They sequence their itineraries to the shapes of leaf-stripped branches. Those seeking counsel spin at the edge of the canyons and upon stopping take the advice of a mushroom spotted in the bramble — or a drop of rain falling on the right ring finger — or a whiff of windfallen apples fermenting on the jags. A child playing on the bridges might, upon seeing her ball wince away from a sharp stone, decide then that it’s time for her to travel the world and grow into herself.<br /><br />But it is hard to leave the guidance of the wishing earth, to go to the villages where only words mean anything, and the denizens refuse to listen unless you hollow yourself like a shell and echo their noises back to them. Many soon return, stumbling back, their knees and knuckles embracing veins of silver and opal. They tip their heads back, and the clouds touch their cheeks with rain, and purr with thunder. When they return, they stay, and would only leave again to meet the stars.<br /><hr /><div style="font-size: 90%;">Figment Theme 5/22/2013: There are so many cities in the world, and a nearly infinite number of fictional towns in addition. Pick an intangible noun (think “hope,” “friendship,” “fear,” “loathing,”) and write a short scene set in a town with that name.</div></div>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_CJ7P9mxIHU/UZwTXPjvbkI/AAAAAAAADoA/zsnV3Nc7omw/s1600/TheNightCircus.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_CJ7P9mxIHU/UZwTXPjvbkI/AAAAAAAADoA/zsnV3Nc7omw/s1600/TheNightCircus.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Circus">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><em>The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called </em>Le Cirque des Rêves<em>, and it is only open at night. <br /><br />But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. <br /><br />True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus per­formers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. <br /><br />Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.</em></blockquote><br />So <i>The Night Circus</i>&nbsp;was fantastic. Morgenstern&#8217;s writing set such an atmosphere that wherever I read it I felt the black-and-white-striped tents rising all around me, the glow of closely-hanging lights.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve taken recently to thinking about books as made of three pillars — world-building, plot, and actual execution. <i>The Night Circus</i> was beautifully written, and set in a beautiful world. I felt the plot itself was a little lacking — the two main characters fall into love perhaps too easily — the Epic Battletimez seemingly promised by the cover description never really happen.<br /><br />But honestly, for me this was just fine. For a while <i>The Night Circus</i> cracked my head open and took me somewhere else, and it did a wonderful job of doing it.<br /><br />The design of the book was also gorgeous. Monochrome sunbursts! Little glowing flecks! It fit the mood of the book so well, and was sooo pretty.</div>

With the Republic edging closer to chaos, the two join a group of Patriot rebels eager to help Day rescue his brother and offer passage to the Colonies. They have only one request—June and Day must assassinate the new Elector.<br /><br />It’s their chance to change the nation, to give voice to a people silenced for too long. <br /><br />But as June realizes this Elector is nothing like his father, she’s haunted by the choice ahead. What if Anden is a new beginning? What if revolution must be more than loss and vengeance, anger and blood—what if the Patriots are wrong?<br /><br />In this highly-anticipated sequel, Lu delivers a breathtaking thriller with high stakes and cinematic action.</em></blockquote><br />[spoilers ahead] <br /><br />I finished <em>Prodigy</em> this past weekend, and enjoyed it. June and Day had more distinctive voices, and some of my confusions I had with the <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/10/legend-marie-lu.html">previous book</a> were addressed more clearly here. In particular, the history of the Republic and the Colonies and how they came to be in conflict with each other is finally revealed, and probably for the best in this book, rather than in <em>Legend</em>; I can&#8217;t imagine the needless bulk that would have been in the first book had all that exposition been thrown in there.<br /><br /><em>Prodigy</em>&#8217;s subversions of cliche were fun; just when you think June has no idea she&#8217;s being tricked, she reveals that she knows even more than you do about what&#8217;s going on, with a cleverness that isn&#8217;t eye-rolling. I thought that June and Day&#8217;s role in the rebellion as Beloved of the People was a little boring — <em>Mockingjay</em> was enough exploration of the &#8220;war celebrity&#8221; for me — though June and Day&#8217;s story, despite everything, is a little brighter than Katniss&#8217; battle angst.<br /><br />Overall, the motivations for each character were pretty well-done in <em>Prodigy</em>. I wish there had been a little more pattern to it — for example, at some point Tess asks Day, &#8220;If it were between me and June, who would you save?&#8221; Day answers, and though Day does later make a choice between June and the rebellion, this question made me expect and want a high-stress situation where Day&#8217;s true feelings between Tess and June were pressured out of him.<br /><br /><em>Prodigy</em>! More cheesecake to enjoy. I like the direction it took with making neither side of the Republic/Colonies war ideal — in fact, both sides were pretty repugnant — and I&#8217;m excited to see where the last book will go.</div>
