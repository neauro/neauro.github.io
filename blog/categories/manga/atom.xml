<blockquote>At the boundary between this realm and another, there live eight million gods, dead spirits who serve the gods, and other assorted spirits who help and meddle in the affairs of humans. A sweet middle school girl named Mutsumi has been enduring bullying from her classmates, and she goes to the restroom by herself to cry. Scrawled on the bathroom wall is a phone number and the message, "I will solve your troubles."
<br/><br/>

After Mutsumi calls the number, she encounters a homeless, unemployed figure who proclaims himself a "god." Crude, unpredictable, and worthless, he does not answer people's prayers and no one acknowledges him. However, he has one sole power, the ability to cut all who pass between this world and the next. (<a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=56588">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>The previous manga description is strange because the character &ldquo;Mutsumi&rdquo; only appears in the first chapter&hellip;but, eh.</p>

<p>Noragami, the first story both written and illustrated by the ADACHI Toka team, <em>is my new favorite manga</em>.</p>

<p>The basic elements of the story are Shinto-style gods; their &ldquo;shinki,&rdquo; who are spirits of deceased humans who can take on the form of weaponry/animals/etc.; and &ldquo;ayakashi,&rdquo; or phantoms, the Bad Animal Things that exist invisibly in the world of humans. The main protagonists are Yato, a &ldquo;stray god&rdquo; without a shrine; Hiyori, a high school girl who, due to a car accident, is a &ldquo;half-ayakashi&rdquo; capable of astral projection; and Yukine, Yato&rsquo;s shinki, who can take the form of a sword. The story starts with Yato&rsquo;s desire to obtain a shrine for his own and delves into the ideas of what it means to trust humans and what it means to live to obtain (or be the source of) happiness.</p>

<p>[mild spoilers ahead]</p>

<p>Reasons why you should read it:</p>

<ul>
<li>The character development is incredible. Even characters like Yukine, who seemed poised to be ultra-generic gruff teenage shounen, grows into a kind of character I rarely see amongst teenage boys: both jealous and compassionate when it comes to people he cares about, easily hurt and full of pride and determination.</li>
<li>Though it starts with a lot of characters explaining painfully exact and detailed world-building to each other, the story continues on to fleshes out every aspect and angle of what you're told about. We start with a single god having a single shinki (Yato and Yukine), and then explore what it means for a god to have multiple shinki (as in the case of Vaisravana and her family), and what it means for a shinki to have multiple gods (as in the case of "Nora"). Each of these aspects come with examinations of the emotions and motivations of all the characters involved. <em>Ahhh it's so good</em></li>
<li>After the first big infodump, the story also introduces "new ideas" very smoothly. When the idea of "what happens when a god dies" is brought in, it continues to be picked up and played with by later events. <em>Which is so fantastic.</em></li>
<li>The art is beautiful! It has more of a "realistic" feel, like <em>Death Note</em>, and the characters are visually varied. <em>The characters are actually varied.</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hiyori isn't terribly interesting yet; she's struggled with wanting to maintain her relationship with Yato, but otherwise doesn't seem to have any personal problems to overcome, which is unfortunate. Whereas Yato and Yukine both have had their share of personal obstacles, Hiyori seems to be taking a "Fruits Basket Tohru-like" role in being "the one that supports everyone (almost) unconditionally." Still, she does call out other characters on their toxic behavior, takes none of that behavior herself, and has cool heroic moments where she saves both Yato and Yukine from their various problems (and <em>not</em> just by encouraging them to talk it out or merely offering phrases like "I believe in you!"...though those happen too).</li>
<li>Still, I have a lot of faith in this manga and I'm looking forward to Hiyori getting more development in the future.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
Right now I am totally in love with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julietta_Suzuki">Suzuki Julietta</a>. She is the manga-ka of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamisama_Kiss"><em>Kamisama Hajimemashita</em></a>, which recently got propelled in my mind to 5-star status after it started acquiring a time paradox, a plot device to which I am particularly weak. (How could she have planned that?! <em>Hoowww</em>?)<br /><br />Suzuki has a great grasp of storytelling and character development, something that I really appreciate in shoujo manga. Recently I described <a href="http://www.mangahere.com/manga/kamisama_hajimemashita/c065/">Chapter 65</a> (and 66) to Andou as an example. It goes like this:<br /><br />Nanami is making talismans for the shrine, so that visitors can come and get charms for things like "traffic safety," "love," "prosperous business." Tomoe sees them and goes, "Your handwriting is awful, let's make new talismans on the nice wood that I stored away." Nanami admits that she thought that wood was trash and threw it away and feels bad that she's disappointed him and hasn't made much headway in being a good god. Later that night, she notices Tomoe leaving and follows him mistakenly across some ethereal border and is almost smashed by a giant's foot. Tomoe saves her, and they wander around the night market searching for new talisman wood. Eventually Nanami separates from Tomoe and discovers two demons bullying a child, and when she tries to intervene, the two demons go for her instead. Wracking her brain for solutions, she eventually leads them beyond the ethereal border, where they are promptly smashed. They sneer that she will get stomped on too, but Nanami smiles and opens her coat to reveal: a talisman for traffic safety.<br /><br />There's just something <em>so delighful</em> about the story coming back full circle. In a sense you should have expected it — maybe you had the fun of figuring out yourself how Nanami could have made it out of her situation — even if you didn't, your brain lights up to realize the importance of something so seemingly insignificant. The final talisman also serves to answer her insecurities about being a bad god (even if her handwriting is bad, it <em>works!</em>), and as a bonus, makes Nanami to me a little more "real" — more of a person who is reacting to things in her environment, learning about them, using them.<br /><br />It's just <em>great</em>, and by no means an isolated formula. For example, in <a href="http://www.mangahere.com/manga/karakuri_odette/v01/c001/">the first chapter of Suzuki's other work, Karakuri Odette</a>, Odette begins attending high school, much to the hesitation of the school administrators. "Don't worry," says Odette's creator, "if she ever runs into problems, she'll emit a signal to me, and I'll pick her up right away." They agree and as Odette tries to learn more about what it means to be human, she asks her creator to make adjustments to her body: first, to add the ability to eat food, and second, to subtract from her robotic physical ability so she's only as strong as an average 15-year-old. Odette finds a new friend who is sickly and occasionally has seizures, and wanders around with her to a construction site, where both Odette and the girl fall into a well. Since she asked to be weakened, Odette can no longer climb out on her own — but then the girl starts to breathe desperately and beg for medicine — so Odette says, "Look away, don't look back until I say so," and when the girl turns away <em>Odette removes her head from her body</em> — which triggers the signal, and makes her creator come running.<br /><br /><em>So good!</em> There's just something utterly delicious of a small detail turning out to mean everything. This is something that I think is a challenge to do with games. When you pick up a key in level 1, for example, it's hard to imagine that it could be used to anything other than a treasure chest. (Though, knowing that, it would be fun to purposefully subvert this and make the key into an instrument for something else.)<br /><br />I've never played A Link to the Past, but apparently there's a great example of "small detail coming back to bite you" in it. It goes kind of like this: In one of the first towns you visit, there's a man who describes a nearby building as the old home of some evil bandit who for some reason couldn't stand the light. You play on, and on, and eventually, you return to the old home, and rescue the maiden in it, who begins to follow you around as you make your escape. At some point, you set a bomb off in a room, which collapses a ceiling and lets the light in — and when the maiden walks into it, she rips her skin off and become's the bandit. <em>The bandit, the dungeon's boss, has been following you this whole time! Whoa! Ahhh!</em><br /><br />Delicious.</div>
