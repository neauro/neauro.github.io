<br />Now that I&#8217;m moving into a place with a yard (!!), I&#8217;ve been eagerly making lists of easy and functional plants to attempt raising, such as rosemary, lavender, and mint. But then I saw blueberry plants at the farmer&#8217;s market! And I remembered that a blueberry bush subsists in my childhood home, which means it&#8217;s grown and borne fruit despite being under the care of a family with only a mildly green (like let&#8217;s say <span style="color: #78ab46;">#78AB46</span>) thumb.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-afLO_FHRiSE/UEUCkMAIZ-I/AAAAAAAACXg/aG6dEvq1rhs/s1600/blueberry.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-afLO_FHRiSE/UEUCkMAIZ-I/AAAAAAAACXg/aG6dEvq1rhs/s640/blueberry.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">blueberryyyy</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This is what I&#8217;ve learned thus far about blueberry plant care from the farmer who sold me the plant, as well as a variety of internet sources:<br /><ol><li>Fertilizer meant for azaleas and rhododendrons is best for blueberries, presumably because it is acidic, and acidity is what blueberries like. Also good: peat moss.</li><li>No chicken manure! (&#8220;It&#8217;s too sweet for them.&#8221;)</li><li>Blueberries like their soil kept moist, and like at least 1&#8221; of water a week. Water is important for fruit growth.</li><li>They prefer 6-8 hours of sun.</li><li>Pruning is recommended in winter, for good air circulation and generally healthy plant growth.</li><li>When pruning, don&#8217;t let branches crisscross; this helps the plant get good air circulation.</li><li>The particular breed I bought (&#8220;Jersey northern highbush&#8221;) yields blueberries late in the year (as in, around now, instead of July through August.)</li><li>The particular variety I got is also self-pollinating, but also appreciates bees visiting from other blueberry plants.</li><li>Blueberries can propagate from cuttings! Not sure if I&#8217;ll try this out immediately, though.</li></ol><div>Something else I&#8217;ve learned, unspecific to blueberries, is that I should really research plant care before purchase. The blueberry plant I bought has a lot of crisscrossing branches already, and some branches that droop so low they touch the ground&#8230;I&#8217;m sure I could have picked a better one if I knew what to look for.</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
When Andou and I <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/07/a-guide-to-some-touristy-things-of-oahu.html">visited Hawaii last month</a>, we had arranged for SpeediShuttle to pick us up on the 7th of July. We waited until about an hour before our flight before we quit calling their unresponsive hotline for reasons why they hadn&#8217;t shown up yet, and called a taxi instead.<br /><br />Well, last weekend we finally heard back from them &#8211; more than seven weeks after we arranged from them to pick us up. It turns out that someone had taken in our information and mis-typed it, somehow taking our request for a July 7th pick-up and noting it as&nbsp;<i>Pick these people up on August 30th.</i><br /><i><br /></i>Though it was a stressful situation at the time, to be honest, after seven weeks it&#8217;s hard to grasp at even a semblance of bitterness. Mistakes happen. Even so, the SpeediShuttle people we spoke to were very kind and offered us a refund, which was great! :) That at least pays for (most of) the taxi fare, haha.<br /><br />To be honest, the thing I&#8217;m most curious about now is how the mistake was made. No matter how I look at the keypad, it seems far-fetched to mis-type <i>8/30</i>&nbsp;instead of <i>7/7</i>&#8230;was the person who made the appointment maybe using an HTML-style form with drop-downs&#8230;even on drop-downs, &#8220;30&#8221; is pretty far from &#8220;7&#8221;&#8230;I mean, if someone&#8217;s just inputting data into a computer, then maybe you could just have users fill in the data themselves, right? Rather than calling a human being to input pickup data for them, and then have no confirmation that the input data was correct?<br /><br />Furthermore, the fact that someone may miss their flight out when their system fails is a pretty serious consequence, one that may warrant at least one person manning their hotline at all times. Or if the hotline could at least take messages when no one&#8217;s there?<br /><br />Shrug.</div>

In her sleeping cabinet behind the rubble of an old barbershop where she lives with her grandfather, she thinks about what is lost-how the world went from amusement parks, movie theaters, birthday parties, fathers and mothers &#8230; to ash and dust, scars, permanent burns, and fused, damaged bodies. And now, at an age when everyone is required to turn themselves over to the militia to either be trained as a soldier or, if they are too damaged and weak, to be used as live targets, Pressia can no longer pretend to be small. Pressia is on the run.<br /><br />Burn a Pure and Breathe the Ash &#8230; <br />There are those who escaped the apocalypse unmarked. Pures. They are tucked safely inside the Dome that protects their healthy, superior bodies. Yet Partridge, whose father is one of the most influential men in the Dome, feels isolated and lonely. Different. He thinks about loss-maybe just because his family is broken; his father is emotionally distant; his brother killed himself; and his mother never made it inside their shelter. Or maybe it&#8217;s his claustrophobia: his feeling that this Dome has become a swaddling of intensely rigid order. So when a slipped phrase suggests his mother might still be alive, Partridge risks his life to leave the Dome to find her. <br /><br />When Pressia meets Partridge, their worlds shatter all over again.</i></blockquote><br />(spoilers ahead)<br /><br />I finished <i>Pure</i>&nbsp;yesterday and I feel fairly mixed about it. The world itself is immensely intriguing, comprised of a vast wasteland and a &#8220;Dome.&#8221; The wastelands are populated with people who, after the &#8220;Detonations,&#8221; found themselves fused to objects, animals, even other people around them. One of the main characters, Pressia, wanders a market filled with emaciated citizens whose flesh is part-glass; she flees the &#8220;Dusts,&#8221; stone-fleshed people who were pressed into buildings; there are even &#8220;Groupies,&#8221; people fused to other people, who seem notorious for drunken-ness and trouble-making.<br /><br />Though at some times I could see it being considered sparse, I adored the to-the-point description.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The droning was some kind of air mission, and we wondered if there would be more bombs. But what would be the point? Everything was done, obliterated or swept up by the fires; there were dark puddles from black rain. Some drank the water and died from it. Our scars were fresh, our wounds and warpings raw. The survivors hobbled and limped, a procession of death, hoping to find a place that had been spared. We gave up. We were slack. We didn&#8217;t take cover. Maybe some were hoping it was a relief effort. Maybe I was too.</i></blockquote><br />Description coming from the characters&#8217; mouths, however, felt heavy and extraneous at times.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;Did you ever wonder why we&#8217;re not experiencing a full nuclear winter? Well, because it was orchestrated to avoid one. They used a cocktail of bombs &#8211; the Low Orbiting Focused Enhanced Radiation Neutron System satellites known as LoFERNS, and the High Orbiting Focused Enhanced Radiation Neutron System satellites, or HiFERNS, with electromagnetic pulse &#8211; EMP &#8211; magnification.&#8221;<br /><br />[&#8230;]<br /><br />&#8220;And how did Dusts come about? The bombs disrupted molecular structures. The cocktails included the distribution of nanotechnology to help speed up the recovery of the earth &#8211; nanotechnology that promotes the self-assembly of molecules. The nanotechnology, speeded up by DNA, which is an informational material but also excellent at the self-assembly of cells, made our fusing stronger. And the nanotechnology that hit the humans trapped in rubble or scorced land helped them to regenerate. Even though they couldn&#8217;t completely free themselves, the human cells of the Dusts grew powerful and learned to survive.&#8221;</i></blockquote><br />I guess this all <i>might</i> be okay because the person speaking is characteristically pedantic? And is at the moment relaying &#8220;conspiracy theories&#8221; to a rebel audience? In the end, I suppose it&#8217;s my personal preference that details this specific about fake technology glossed over and left to stand real in their ambiguity.<br /><br />Characters also tend to realize things abruptly and completely believe in those realizations, or else remember something suddenly, pose it as a possible explanation for whatever is happening, and pages later accept it as fact.<br /><br />This book often references Japan due to the connection between &#8220;Detonations&#8221; and the effects of atomic bombs during World War II. I felt a little uncomfortable about Japan&#8217;s relation to the story, though, in ways that it&#8217;s difficult for me to describe. Pressia, who knows she&#8217;s half-Japanese (despite not knowing what &#8220;Japan&#8221; is), is described twice as having almond-shaped eyes, which feeds my personal pet peeve of non-white features described with food items (i.e. &#8220;caramel&#8221; or &#8220;chocolate&#8221; skin) &#8211; in some sense it serves as a reminder that everyone else in the book is European-descended (except, maybe, the character whose name is &#8220;El Capitan&#8221;).<br /><br />Later, another character theorizes,<br /><br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;Here&#8217;s my take. The man your mother had a child with, he was in one everything that the Japanese were doing &#8211; or trying to undo. Radiation resistance. Your mother fed him information. I agree with your mother&#8217;s decision there. <b>Some of the Japanese were really the good guys, if you ask me</b> [&#8230;]</i>&#8221;</blockquote><br />I don&#8217;t understand this part. If &#8220;some of the Japanese were really the good guys,&#8221; it kind of sounds like the majority of them are not? Or that it&#8217;s accepted knowledge that the majority of them were not? And what does &#8220;bad guys&#8221; mean in this scenario? I can&#8217;t imagine why anyone would think of radiation resistance scientists as &#8220;bad guys,&#8221; much less the civilian population affected by the bomb. By the end of the book, &#8220;Japan&#8221; ends up being nothing more than exotic wallpaper: almond-shaped eyes, shiny black hair, &#8220;even-toned skin&#8221; (what does this even mean and why is it ascribed to Pressia&#8217;s Japanese blood), a flashback of flowering branches, some random Japanese writing, and &#8220;some good guys.&#8221;<br /><br />One last thing that made me wince &#8211; this conversation, between a &#8220;Pure&#8221; person, Partridge, and Bradwell, who lived through the Detonations and was disfigured by them:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;Jesus!&#8221; [Bradwell] says, hit by a sudden flare of anger. &#8220;What&#8217;s it like to walk around perfect, huh, Partridge? No scars, no burns, no birds. To be a clean slate?&#8221;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>The question makes Partridge angry. &#8220;Just because I live in a Dome doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve never suffered. I mean, it&#8217;s not like your suffering. What could compare to this, huh? Do you want an award for it? A medal that says First Place Suffering? You win, Bradwell. Okay? You win.&#8221;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>[Partridge describes the death of his brother]</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Bradwell pauses a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about that.&#8221; It feels like an apology for a lot of things, actually, like thinking Partridge&#8217;s life was a cakewalk.</i></blockquote><br />This exchange was sigh-inducing to me because:<br /><br /><ol><li>Partridge is a character from a position of power that he <i>literally</i>&nbsp;has because his father orchestrated the bombing of all these people &#8211; who then demands from one of those people, &#8220;What about <i>my</i>&nbsp;problems?!&#8221;</li><li>Even if Partridge&#8217;s life was not 100% pure utter euphoria, his quality of life within the Dome (with edible food, education, general health) really just&nbsp;<i>can&#8217;t</i>&nbsp;be compared to Bradwell&#8217;s life, in which most days are described as a struggle, where everyone has been hurt by an elite few for the sake of the elite. </li><li>Even so, I guess it&#8217;s okay that characters from different backgrounds exchange sympathies? But in the end, Bradwell still feels like the bad guy &#8211; he sympathizes with Partridge, and Partridge doesn&#8217;t bother sympathizing with Bradwell at all.</li></ol><div>It&#8217;s just&#8230;sigh-inducing.</div><div><br /></div><div>There were a couple moments in the book where I was like, &#8220;Whoa, do you feel that? I just had the STRONGEST EMOTION,&#8221; so that was nice. I&#8217;m also curious to see how Fox 2000, who apparently has the film rights to this book, will depict a world in which the majority of people are visibly not &#8220;Pure.&#8221;</div></div>

For example, the following is wrong:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: html"><script src="game.js"></script> <!-- "WHERE IS #CANVAS" --><br /><canvas id="canvas"></canvas><br /></pre><br />In trying to do collision stuff, I also ran into a curious problem where the following did not work:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">if ( ((that.X-that.radius) &lt;= (player.X+player.width)) &amp;&amp;<br />(that.Y &gt;= player.Y) &amp;&amp;<br />(that.Y &lt; (player.y+player.height)))<br />collided = PADDLE;<br /></pre><br />But this <em>did</em>:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">var hit_paddle_side = beneath_paddle_top = above_paddle_bottom = false;<br /><br />if (((that.X-that.radius) &lt;= (player.X+player.width))) hit_paddle_side = true;                 if ((that.Y &gt;= player.Y)) beneath_paddle_top = true;<br />if ((that.Y &lt; (player.Y+player.height))) above_paddle_bottom = true;<br /><br />if (hit_paddle_side &amp;&amp; beneath_paddle_top &amp;&amp; above_paddle_bottom)<br />    collided = PADDLE;<br /></pre><br />Not sure why yet.<br /><br />All the code is <a href="https://github.com/neauro/html5pong">on my Github</a> for now.</div>

Given my limited store of ingredients, we went with cheesecake, that being the type of cupcake that requires little investment in terms of icing and ingredients that I didn&#8217;t posses.<br /><br />The recipe is sourced from what I now realize is <a href="http://www.kraftrecipes.com/recipes/paula-deens-easy-cheesecake-120241.aspx">Kraft&#8217;s Recipes</a>. We changed the butter extract to vanilla extract. The recipe is for 12 cupcakes, but we ended up making around 18. Also, we ended up not putting any jam or anything on the cupcakes, but they were quite sweet on their own.<br /><br /><b>Ingredients</b><br /><ol><li>2 pkg. (8 oz. each) cream cheese, softened</li><li>1 cup granulated sugar</li><li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li><li>2 &nbsp;eggs</li><li>12 vanilla wafers</li><li>1 cup seedless raspberry jam</li><li>1pt. fresh raspberries</li><li>2 tbsp. powdered sugar for dusting</li></ol><div><br /></div><div><b>Instructions</b></div><div><div><ol><li>Place a paper cupcake liner in each of 18 muffin cups.</li><li>Beat cream cheese until fluffy. Add granulated sugar and butter extract, beating well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li><li>Place a vanilla wafer, flat-side down, in each muffin cup. Spoon cream cheese mixture over wafers, until paper lining is about 3/4ths filled. Bake for 20 minutes.</li><li>Allow tarts to cool completely. When cool, top each cheesecake cupcake with 1/2 Tbsp. of raspberry jam and fresh raspberries. Dust with powdered sugar.</li></ol><br />Since the vanilla wafers we bought were a little too small for the paper liner, we experimented with making half the liners filled with whole wafers, and half with crushed. (By the way &#8211; vanilla wafers are easily crushed by placing them inside a glass mixing bowl, and mashing them with the flat bottom of another glass.)</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Unu9_hZ3afA/UDJpVbnjmSI/AAAAAAAACRQ/6U1WFs44JZ8/s1600/DSC_0002%2B%25282%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Unu9_hZ3afA/UDJpVbnjmSI/AAAAAAAACRQ/6U1WFs44JZ8/s640/DSC_0002%2B%25282%2529.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />In the end, the crushed wafers ended up quite crumbly, so whole wafers really are probably the way to go.</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I get a little wary sometimes writing posts like these, especially since it involves copycatting other posts for sample code and etc. But&#8230;I just find that I learn better both a) working/writing out thoughts for myself; b) putting myself in a position of &#8220;teaching&#8221; in &#8220;public,&#8221; where I become more thoughtful about what I&#8217;m doing and really understanding it; and, c) putting everything into a format like a blog post, where I can feel a modicum of success/productivity after posting. #realityissooobroken<br /><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2863435/front-end-developer-interview-questions"><br /></a><br /><h2><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2863435/front-end-developer-interview-questions">What is ECMAScript?</a></h2><a href="http://infrequently.org/2008/08/the-ecmajavascript-name-soup/">JavaScript</a>. <a href="http://www.dotnetguru2.org/sebastienros/index.php/2009/10/11/ecmascript-vs-javascript">ECMAScript 3 (EM3) is equivalent to JavaScript 1.5</a>, and is the best to program in for scripts that will run across various browsers (as of 2009). <a href="http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/">This table</a>&nbsp;shows the existence of some EM5 functions for various browers.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h2>How do JavaScript functions deal with arguments?</h2>In JavaScript, every function has an argument list of variable length, so a function that takes and prints 1 argument can still be passed 3 arguments, and will complainlessly print out the first argument.<br /><br />A function can look at all the arguments its been passed by looking at an&nbsp;<code>arguments</code>&nbsp;object, which is like an array (with indexes, and a length, though you&nbsp;<em>can&#8217;t</em>&nbsp;push/pop into it, or split it).<br /><br />Source:&nbsp;<a href="http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2007/07/05/function-apply-and-function-call-in-javascript.aspx">Function.apply and Function.call in JavaScript</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><h2>What&#8217;s the difference between JavaScript <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> functions?</h2>What <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> do is change what the keyword <em>this</em> references at run-time.<br /><pre class="brush: js">x = 10;<br /><br /> function function_name() {<br />   alert(this.x);<br />  }<br /><br /> function();<br /></pre><br />In the previous, <code>this</code> references the global namespace, and the output is 10.<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">x = 10;<br /> object = { x: 5 };<br /><br /> function function_name() {<br />   alert(x);<br />  }<br /><br /> function();<br /> function.call(object);<br /></pre><br />This time, the first function call outputs 10, whereas the second function call outputs 15. <code>this</code> in the second function call uses <code>object</code> as the namespace, and refers to <code>object</code>&#8217;s value of <code>s</code>.<br /><br />You can also pass arguments to a function using <code>call</code>, as happens in the following.<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">x = 10;<br /> object = { x: 5 };<br /><br /> function function_name(message) {<br />   alert(message);<br />   alert(x);<br />  }<br /><br /> function("invoking f");<br /> function.call(object, "invoking f with a call");<br /></pre><br />Finally, what&#8217;s the difference between <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code>? They both change the namespace at run-time, but <code>apply</code>&#8217;s second parameter always needs to be an array.<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">x = 10;<br /> object = { x: 5 };<br /><br /> function function_name(message) {<br />   alert(message);<br />   alert(x);<br />  }<br /><br /> function("invoking f");<br /> function.apply(object, ["invoking f with an apply"]);<br /></pre><br />Apply is the more interesting of the two; because it can use an array, it can work with JavaScript&#8217;s <code>arguments</code> object.<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2007/07/05/function-apply-and-function-call-in-javascript.aspx">Function.apply and Function.call in JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2007/07/06/putting-function-apply-to-work.aspx">Putting Function.apply() to work</a><br /><br /><br /><h2>What is currying?</h2><div>To curry is to take a function which accepts multiple arguments, and to convert it into one funtion that takes one argument and returns another function.

Because the closure is a stack frame that is not deallocated when a function returns, it also contains the local variables that remain &#8220;alive&#8221; after a function has returned. A closure is used every time a function is declared within another function.<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">function say_hello(name) {<br />    var hello = "hello";<br />    var hello_alert = function () { alert(hello + name); }; // closure created!<br />    return hello_alert;<br />  }<br />  <br />  hello_arupaka = say_hello(arupaka);<br />  hello_arupaka(); // alerts "hello arupaka";<br /></pre><br />In most languages, after a function (like <code>say_hello(arupaka)</code>) returns, the local variables are destroyed; but, when calling <code>hello_arupaka()</code>, the locally-created text &#8221;<code>arupaka</code>&#8221; is still available. Closures!<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">function setup_globals() {<br />    var num = "3";<br /><br />    var alert_num = function () { alert(num); };<br />    var increment_num = function () { num++;  };<br />    var decrement_num = function () { num-- };<br />    return hello_alert;<br />  }<br /></pre><br />So what are the closures of <code>alert_num</code>, <code>increment_num</code>, and <code>decrement_num</code> above, and how do they relate? Because closures are set up every time a function is called within a function, they all have shared access to the same closure.<br /><br />Note: if you were to call <code>setup_globals</code> one more time, all the inside functions would be overwritten.<br /><br />Next closure example: what does <code>testList()</code> output?<br /><pre class="brush: js">function buildList(list) {<br />  var result = [];<br />  for (var i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i++) {<br />    var item = 'item' + list[i];<br />    result.push( function() {alert(item + ' ' + list[i])} );<br />  }<br />  return result;<br />}<br /><br />function testList() {<br />  var fnlist = buildList([1,2,3]);<br />  for (var j = 0; j &lt; fnlist.length; j++) {<br />    fnlist[j]();<br />  }<br />}</pre><br />Answer: 3 alerts, all of which read <code>item3 undefined</code>. This is because all functions created by <code>result.push( function() {alert(item + ' ' + list[i])} );</code> have shared access to the same closure. The array containing these functions in turn looks like this:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9nusfNfzd0c/UDJU6Uy4hBI/AAAAAAAACOc/Xlifc7pySVs/s1600/closurearray.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="an array with each cell containing alert(item + &quot; &quot; + list[i]);" border="0" height="147" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9nusfNfzd0c/UDJU6Uy4hBI/AAAAAAAACOc/Xlifc7pySVs/s400/closurearray.jpg" title="" width="400" /></a></div><br />And when <code>testList</code> calls <code>fnlist[j]()</code>,&nbsp;each&nbsp;<code>list[i]</code>&nbsp;uses the same value of <code>i</code> (which was incremented to 3) and <code>list[3]</code> is undefined. Each cell alerts <code>item3</code> because that was the last value assigned to <code> var item</code>.<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work">How do JavaScript closures work</a>?, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)">Wikipedia: Closure</a>  <br /><br /><br /><h2>What&#8217;s the difference between event bubbling and event capture?</h2>First: DOM (Document Object Model) is a convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML. When a page is rendered by a browser, that browser parses the HTML from the web server into an in-memory DOM. Different web browsers have their own internal model of DOM. The DOM views an HTML document <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmldom/dom_nodetree.asp">as a tree</a>.<br /><br />DOM events allow programming languages like JavaScript attach event handlers to tree nodes (different elements on a page), and react when users click/mouseover those nodes.<br /><br />So, what happens when you want to attach an event handler to a couple different elements on a webpage? Rather than define separate handlers for each element, you can have the events work with a node that contains those elements.<br /><br />In order to find the containing node, events need to be able to &#8220;propogate,&#8221; or move through the DOM node tree. In event bubbling, the event is first handled at the inner most elements, and then propagated to the outer elements. (A great example of this is <a href="http://www.javascripter.net/faq/eventbubbling.htm">here</a>!) Event capturing is the opposite: the event is first handled by the outermost element, and then propagated to the inner-most element.<br /><br />Only event bubbling is supported by all major browsers.<br /><br />Sources: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">Wikipedia: Document Object Model</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmldom/dom_nodetree.asp">W3Schools: HTML DOM Node Tree</a>, <a href="http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/webprog/dhtml/ch06_05.htm">Event Propagation</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4616694/what-is-event-bubbling-and-capturing">StackOverflow: What is event bubbling and capturing?</a></div>
