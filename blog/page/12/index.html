It occurs to me that I never did update after <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/04/okami-cosplay.html">my previous post on our Okami cosplay</a>.

The idea was that if you were hungry, but not sure what exactly you wanted to eat, you could just sit here and click <i>Random picture!</i>&nbsp;until you saw something sufficiently appetizing, nearby, and cheap.<br /><br />The first thing to do was to make sure that this idea wasn&#8217;t already done. Looking around, we (me and <a href="http://joshuahou.com/">Joshua Hou</a>, my then partner) turned up a couple similar sites, including:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Yelp</b>: the obvious comparison. But, though at the time it incorporated user-contributed photos of food, it didn&#8217;t do it to the extent that we wanted to support it.</li><li><b>Google Hotpot</b>: newly released at the time, but, despite its food-related name, still not all about photos of food.</li></ul><br />The main task that I wanted to support foremost was, <i>Look at pictures of food, and see where they are.</i>&nbsp;For that reason, the two main things on the front page are some random featured food (indicated by numeral 1), and a map (numeral 3). You can also specify and limit what area food is shown from (numeral 6).<br /><br />The other main task here is <i>Find a specific kind of food,</i>&nbsp;which is supported by the search bar at the top of the page.<br /><br />Another aspect of the site is the ability to comment and rate dishes &#8211; but since this should really be secondary to &#8220;Look at delicious things!&#8221; it&#8217;s limited to ratings on a five-star scale, and a short description.<br /><br />Views of specific dishes (the wireframe on the bottom-left) show all the photos associated with the dish, as well as comments and ratings. Views of specific restaurants show all photos associated with the dishes at that restaurant, with the idea that a restaurant-specific page would become a crowdsourced visual menu. Which brings me to one question that I have about the concept of this site: how does having photos of food affect the stakeholders here? Fancy restaurants seem fond of depicting menu items with a variety of delicious buzzwords and nothing else, and when you, as the diner, finally receive your food, part of the pleasure is the surprise of seeing what it looks like. Along with general usability testing, questions like this would be part of &#8220;next steps&#8221; for this design.</div>

The past few days I&#8217;ve been trying my hand at making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe">wireframes</a>, which are basically very simple website layouts.

At Fugazo, I was hired initially to design a hidden object game. I&#8217;ve made a couple of posts about&nbsp;<a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search?q=hidden+object">this type of game</a>, but never talked about mine, which was going to be a fantastical version a la <a href="http://www.boomzap.com/">Boomzap</a>&#8217;s <i>Awakening</i> series, which would hopefully shine in a market saturated with grimy amusement parks and children being stolen and dangled off cliff-ledges by evil wizards.<br /><br />The premise of the story was that a village had had its special crown stolen by a thief, who wanted it for a queen in a distant land, who in turn wanted it so she could look cool at parties. The crown was a symbol of the ancient pact the village had with the elements, and upon its disappearance havoc arose: cookfires burst, water slid away from mouths and flasks, the air blew cold, stones rolled across the feet of weary villagers, etc.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YtmP55ls_xA/UAN1Xkcy1CI/AAAAAAAABqs/WjAqz6RtxtQ/s1600/elements+map+3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="481" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YtmP55ls_xA/UAN1Xkcy1CI/AAAAAAAABqs/WjAqz6RtxtQ/s640/elements+map+3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a sketch of the world map;<br />the big part is the temple, the bottom-left part the village</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The elemental avatars were housed in a temple with four quarters on some massive landmass overlooking the village. Wanting to set things straight, the villagers send a girl to temple to make peace, and she ventures bravely despite the fact that avatars are known to turn annoying trespassers into statues or sparrows or whatever else pleases them. Upon arriving at the temple, the girl runs into a talking hawk, who aids her in her quest with dry banter and the occasional vague StarCraft reference.

What mini-games were implemented aren&#8217;t something that can be easily shared either, as are the environments and dialogue that I scripted out using our in-game scene editor&#8230;so, bummer.<br /><br />Why was the project canceled? Mainly because our small team (one designer, one programmer, and roughly four artists) couldn&#8217;t compete with much larger teams working on the market. Art style is at the forefront of the hidden object genre, with many players turning away if something is too dark or too colorful, and we didn&#8217;t have the power to create, polish, and re-polish within a reasonable timeframe, especially with the paint-y style that we wanted to move forward with. &nbsp;There was also greater interest with pursuing more &#8220;game-y&#8221; games, hidden objects being fairly linear.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mPTPHA4aTQo/UAOokIYbyJI/AAAAAAAABr8/bTRj-F6cECw/s1600/elements+air+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="408" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mPTPHA4aTQo/UAOokIYbyJI/AAAAAAAABr8/bTRj-F6cECw/s640/elements+air+temple.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketches of the air temple, which (spoilers) was going to be on the back of a bird<br />that blue is a plastic tape-bookmarker-thing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Perhaps some elements of&#8230;Elements&#8230;will be recycled for future projects.</div>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kyLTykn1SaA/UAMFyJo1V9I/AAAAAAAABqI/KGa3OmatUYM/s1600/10174795.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kyLTykn1SaA/UAMFyJo1V9I/AAAAAAAABqI/KGa3OmatUYM/s320/10174795.jpg" width="213" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10174795-glow">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I rarely do book reviews, because I personally feel that what makes a book good is a convoluted stew of good feelings and fresh learning that can&#8217;t be condensed into recipe. Furthermore, when I encounter a book I dislike, I concede that there are many people who like it, who were searching within it for something that I was not searching for, something that they found and I didn&#8217;t. Why look for the sky in the sea?<br /><br />I want to ~*engage more critically*~ with what I read, however, so&#8230;here I go!<br /><br />First, the cover description:<br /><blockquote><i>The Empyrean is the only home fifteen-year-old Waverly has ever known. Part of the first generation to be successfully conceived in deep space, she and her boyfriend, Kieran, will be pioneers of New Earth. Waverly knows she must marry young in order to have children who can carry on the mission, and Kieran, the handsome captain-to-be, has everything Waverly could want in a husband. Everyone is sure he&#8217;s the best choice. Still, there&#8217;s a part of Waverly that wants more from life than marriage, and she is secretly intrigued by the sky, darkly brilliant Seth.</i><br /><br /><i>Suddenly, Waverly&#8217;s dreams are interrupted by the inconceivable &#8211; a violent betrayal by the Empyrean&#8217;s sister ship, the New Horizon. The New Horizon&#8217;s leaders are desperate to populate the new planet first, and will do anything to get what they need: young girls. In one pivotal moment, Waverly and Kieran are separated, and they find themselves at the helms of dangerous missions, where every move has potentially devastating consequences, and the decisions of the heart may lead to disaster.</i></blockquote>I found this book on the library shelf and thought the premise was interesting enough. I would have said maybe half a year ago that I adore YA, but recently most YA novels have disappointed me in terms of the shallowness with which they engage their issues, and inability to stray from a plot that involves a love triangle.<br /><br />Glow is the first book of a YA trilogy, because YA novels always come in triplets now, I suppose. The story is so fast-paced that there&#8217;s not enough time to learn about anyone. What you do know about people is told to you outright, rather than shown firsthand through character interactions, through things that happen.<br /><br />One of the first characters you are told about is Waverly, through the eyes of Kieran.<br /><blockquote>[Waverly] was a watchful person, and intelligent, a trait that showed in the deliberate way her dark eyes found their mark and held it steady. She had a way of seeing into people and understanding their motives that Kieran found almost unnerving [&#8230;]</blockquote>This description comes right after Kieran asks Waverly to marry him, and comes in lieu of Waverly actually <i>doing</i> any of the things that Kieran says are characteristic of her. When Waverly guesses earlier that Kieran is extending a proposal to her, it isn&#8217;t written like something that she understands with her Waverly-special power. At some point Waverly is &#8220;unreadable in the way she looked at him, waiting, saying nothing,&#8221; which could parallel the way &#8220;her dark eyes found their mark and held it steady&#8221; &#8211; in which case, why not put Kieran&#8217;s observation of her characteristic gaze <i>there</i>, right when the action is happening?<br /><br />Another character is the Captain:<br /><blockquote>In truth, the Captain was the most purposeful man on the ship, quick with his decisions, which were almost always right, and trusted by all the men on the ship, though he was less popular with women.</blockquote>Imagine how much more compelling the Captain character would have been if he was shown in some brief situation with his council or something, and the Captain said, &#8220;Listen, this thing just happened, so we need to do X,&#8221; and the men said, &#8220;Oh my gosh, I must act on your will immediately,&#8221; whereas the women eyed him sidelong and were like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about this.&#8221; You would have learned that the captain was &#8220;trusted by all the men on the ship, though he was less popular with the women,&#8221; with the added bonus of actually seeing it yourself.<br /><br />This is assuming that it&#8217;s ever going to be important that the Captain is less popular with women, which it isn&#8217;t. On page 82 it turns out that Waverly has felt uncomfortable in the male gaze of <i>many</i> men on the ship, which means that the fact that the Captain is unpopular as an individual should be unworthy of note. It just doesn&#8217;t <i>mean anything</i> in the long run.<br /><br />Backstories are also blurted out in solid paragraphs. You&#8217;re handheld through Waverly&#8217;s history with Seth, her second love interest, and with her ex-best-friend Felicity. Maybe the point of the book wasn&#8217;t for Waverly share these experiences firsthand with the reader; but the resulting effect is that these characters are like dolls that are handed to you, rather than &#8220;real people.&#8221;<br /><br />There are also characters that are completely meaningless, like Serafina Mbewe, &#8220;a sweet little girl&#8221; who is deaf. What does it mean that she&#8217;s deaf? Does deafness happen all the time? Did this ship heading for the brand new human world prepare for deaf people? Can Serafina communicate at all? Later, after an announcement by Anne Mathers that the girls&#8217; families are dead, Waverly &#8220;picked up Serafina Mbewe, who was crying&#8221; &#8211; wait, <i>what</i>? Did deaf Serafina hear the announcement? Lipread it? Did Serafina just pick up the distressed atmosphere of the girls around her? Is Serafina just meant to be the token helpless child that shows up to prove that Waverly cares about other people, even if Waverly doesn&#8217;t exhibit any caring by way of worrying about her or thinking about her throughout the book? Serafina is a deaf child amidst a world of not-deaf children, so she sticks out; but she does little to support Waverly&#8217;s character, and doesn&#8217;t do anything to advance the plot.<br /><br />The book&#8217;s premise necessarily involves issues of gender and sex, but the way it treats it is shallow, and in some places cringe-worthy. In a book with so many female characters, it&#8217;s still all about women reacting to men&#8217;s actions and desires. The women of the book are notable for wanting children. And here&#8217;s Waverly, on page 93:<br /><blockquote>Days before, her biggest worry was about marrying Kieran. She should have said yes to him, with no hesitation. <i>Yes, Kieran, I will marry you. I love you.</i> <strong>He needed to hear that, and she should have given it to him.</strong></blockquote>Wait, WHAT?! Waverly &#8211; what about <i>your</i> feelings? Are we seriously reading about something like marriage being something that Waverly should have done to please Kieran? Maybe this is supposed to be an example of Waverly succumbing to men&#8217;s desires, you know, a bad example, something that she rises above &#8211; but, nope. Waverly muses on how Kieran deserved her approval and acceptance of him, despite any (unsaid) feelings she has about him herself, and that&#8217;s that.<br /><br />There are also issues with setting. Waverly has been on a spaceship her entire life. At some point, Waverly describes:<br /><blockquote>Few adults on the Empyrean had been willing to talk about their planet of origin&#8230;. They always changed the subject if she asked too many questions [&#8230;]</blockquote>Which means that what Waverly knows about Earth, or Earth things, likely comes only from the ship&#8217;s environment, or from the classes she&#8217;s taken. Yet, later:<br /><blockquote>&#8220;Have you ever had ice cream?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We don&#8217;t carry cows on the Empyrean,&#8221; Waverly said [&#8230;]</blockquote>Wait, <i>what</i>? Okay, so there are no cows on the Empyrean &#8211; but Waverly knows what a cow <i>is</i>? Even if she had learned about what a cow is, through classes or through an adult&#8217;s hidden past, Waverly not only knows what a cow is, but that milk can be harvested from it, and that milk can be processed to create food products, which includes something called ice cream? Waverly knows all this about a creature which she has never seen personally, and who she really should have no reason to even learn about, since there are no cows on the Empyrean?<br /><br />It&#8217;s an example of the narrowness of this setting despite its uniqueness. How do young characters like Waverly,&nbsp;born on the ship, clash with characters that once lived on Earth? Was the transition from &#8220;I have an entire world to roam&#8221; to &#8220;Now I live on this ship&#8221; made with such ease that no child ever sees an adult struggle with it? (I mean, older people seem to struggle all the time with the ease with which children master iPods and computers.) Is there even amber on the Empyrean for Waverly to use as reference when she describes Kieran&#8217;s eyes as &#8220;amber brown&#8221;? Even if there was, wouldn&#8217;t it be so much cooler if Waverly was like, Wow, Kieran&#8217;s eyes are <i>amber</i>, the color of something that exists on my home planet that I&#8217;ve never seen, which can only be made from the amazing phenomenon of placing tree resin under sustained heat and pressure?<br /><br />Furthermore, certain problems that I expected don&#8217;t crop up at all; for example, didn&#8217;t anyone on this mission ever think about inbreeding? They want to populate an entire new world of humans, yet impregnate dozens of women from the eggs of a couple girls? There&#8217;s not even one note about how bad this could potentially be in the distant future?<br /><br />What I did like about this book was the movement of religion through the characters, and especially the switch-around that happened between the ships and Waverly and Kieran&#8217;s motivations. Given the pace and breadth of characters and setting introduced, however, &#8220;Glow&#8221; really feels like the second of its trilogy, a book that hands over its characters and settings as given, rather than letting them grow.</div>

Thanks! If you do decide to read any, I recommend Kenneth Oppel&#39;s &quot;Matt Cruse&quot; series (is it even YA? Suddenly I&#39;m not sure, but they&#39;re fun), Speak and Wintergirls by Laurie Halse Anderson (which are not fantasy, but deal with sexual assault and anorexia), and The Hunger Games (which is like the poster child of YA right now, especially this new genre of &quot;dystopian trilogy,&quot; haha).</div>

Nice review! Maybe I should read some YA fiction sometime, just to see if I can pick it apart like you have here&#8230; :)</div>

and was a little disappointed by it. (spoilers ahead)<br /><div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nDvl14uO4FA/T-fRrFCHmsI/AAAAAAAABNs/R09YmE54Mig/s1600/295px-Brave-Apple-Poster.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nDvl14uO4FA/T-fRrFCHmsI/AAAAAAAABNs/R09YmE54Mig/s320/295px-Brave-Apple-Poster.jpg" width="216" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the art was gorgeous, though (<a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/Brave">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The movie on the whole is beautiful, but the characters and story felt shallow and unfocused. Soon after the start of the movie, Merida describes her family and lifestyle, from the fact that her mother is controlling to the existence of her three younger brothers &#8211; a huge contrast from introductory sequences a la WALL-E and Up, where you are given the chance to watch characters interact, learn what they do and what they love without anyone explaining it to you like a textbook.<br /><br />Throughout the movie there were little actions that I wish had had more background or more follow-through, more <i>meaning</i>&nbsp;in general.<br /><br />For example, when her mother gave her that necklace &#8211; how important was it? Wouldn&#8217;t it have felt so much more <i>painful</i> to watch Merida give that necklace away to the witch if you had known <i>anything</i><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;about it? If it was something her mother had inherited, something that stood for all the tradition and love that her mother was trying to give to her, which Merida then selfishly threw away?</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">And, why is it so important for Merida to be introduced as an amazing archer &#8211; what purpose did her archery ever serve to the story? There&#8217;s the competition scene, but her shooting in that case didn&#8217;t make any difference to the fact she was still going to be married off. For the rest of the movie, whenever she shoots an arrow (like at that Big Evil Magic Bear) it </span><i style="background-color: white;">doesn&#8217;t do anything</i><span style="background-color: white;">. Contrast to Katniss in The Hunger Games, whose proficient archery is used at all times to express her character: it&#8217;s used in her illicit yet altruistic hunting activity, it&#8217;s what she uses to defy the Capitol during her evaluation, it&#8217;s what she uses to explode her enemies&#8217; supplies before she&#8217;s ready to actually kill them, and it&#8217;s what she uses when she does kill her first human being. In fact, at the end of Brave you saw Merida showing off more of her sword skills when she prevents her father from attacking her mother. So, why stress her archery?</span><br /><br />The movie also worked off some assumptions of marriage that I wish had been explained. Like &#8211; why is Merida so <i>immediately</i>&nbsp;opposed to marriage? Why does marriage even need to happen in this story, other than the fact that it&#8217;s &#8220;The Tradition&#8221;? At some point Merida&#8217;s mother starts lecturing off this story about how Tradition is Important, but it still doesn&#8217;t have any&nbsp;tie-in to why Merida has to be married, or why this is such an oppressive thing. I mean, her mother is doing okay, right? &nbsp;Her mother is shown to wield an incredible amount of respect among all the other men in the movie, walking among their brawls without a scratch, pacifying them with ear pinches.<br /><br />And the way this &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be married!&#8221; conflict ended made me cringe. Essentially, Merida confronts the other clan leaders and their sons and, with the blessing of her (pantomiming, bear-shaped) mother, declares &#8220;It&#8217;s time for us to break away from tradition!&#8221;<br /><br />And the men go, &#8220;Hmm, okay!&#8221;<br /><br />It was just so&#8230;.<i>aww, man</i>. Because, a<span style="background-color: white;">ssuming marriage is an institution of oppression towards women (which it&#8217;s treated as during this movie), it&#8217;s dissolved </span><i style="background-color: white;">way</i><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;too easily &#8211; essentially by women (Merida, and her mother) deciding for themselves that they no longer want to be held beneath it.&nbsp;It reeks of the idea that people choose whether or not to be a victim &#8211; as if this whole time, Merida and her mother had just been &#8220;oppressing themselves.&#8221; Brave is a fictional children&#8217;s movie, but the idea that &#8220;People can just get whatever they want if they just ask for it&#8221; is one that&#8217;s very well-believed, and in the end I would have preferred to see Merida really <i>fight</i>&nbsp;to &#8220;change her fate,&#8221; as the move&#8217;s tagline stated, instead of &#8220;discover that the true power to succeed was within her all along,&#8221; which is blatantly American Dream-y.</span><br /><br />Really <i>fight</i>&nbsp;someone else other than her mother, I mean, who was I guess is the only person in this movie&nbsp;not progressive enough to be okay with Merida not marrying.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">Even if you don&#8217;t want to think about it from a social justice-y standpoint, it&#8217;s still mind-boggling why the problem Merida had in this movie was marriage. Merida&#8217;s mother wanted marriage for the purposes of &#8220;keeping peace&#8221; between the clans; but the clan-leaders and their sons clearly didn&#8217;t want marriage badly enough to argue when Merida proposed an alternative.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">The last thing I want to mention: what was up with that magical warrior bear? I guess it was chasing Merida at the very beginning of the movie, and at the end, surrounded by people, was only interested in mauling <i>her? &nbsp;</i>&nbsp;The way that he dissolved into blue at the end seemed to imply that he had some relation to the will-o-the-wisps, but I don&#8217;t get how Merida was important to him at all.</span><br /><br />That all being said, I guess I&#8217;m still looking forward to Pixar&#8217;s <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/pixar-day-of-the-dead-movie/">next movie</a>.</div></div>

The book is basically a series of animals and evolutionary characteristics, followed by a small &#8220;implications for design&#8221; section.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">For example, the book points out that sharks rarely have barnacles and bacteria on their skin, something that other fish and whales often have. This is because sharkskin is too rough and prickly to support such creatures easily, and this inspired the manufacture of a texture which could be stuck to things like doorknobs, and reduced the number of bacteria growing there <i>purely by texture alone</i>. <i>Whoa.</i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Another part of the book talked about how the pattern made by fallen leaves was always beautiful. I read it once again, thinking, <i>Wait, really? What the hell could this inspire design-wise</i>, and lo, it actually inspired <i>carpet which could look good no matter what direction its tiles were placed in.</i>&nbsp;I guess some patterned carpet needs to get laid in a certain order in order to look right, and there&#8217;s some 17% cut-off in such carpet when the laying-down goes awry &#8211; but with randomly-patterned carpet, there was only 2% cut-off! Wat!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">There were many more creatures and plants that inspired different awesome designs, and it reminded me of <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2011/08/21/13-year-old-gets-patent-for-efficient-solar-power-panel-array/">that kid who looked at trees and then got a patent</a> for his solar panels arrays, which were arranged in a spiral like the branches of a tree and were able to collect 20% or more energy than normal panels. &nbsp;Damn nature, u smart though.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I hope I&#8217;m not missing out on too much nature intelligence by keeping my head in books like this all the time.</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
What have I been up to recently? Namely:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YYkNq4aUJU4/T9qGUiOSyGI/AAAAAAAAA1o/Y-Gt500Is48/s1600/shibacm2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="347" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YYkNq4aUJU4/T9qGUiOSyGI/AAAAAAAAA1o/Y-Gt500Is48/s640/shibacm2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">vim, and the <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/sfshiba">shiba inu puppy cam</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />My first larger-scale game project drew to an &#8220;official&#8221; close last Friday (&#8220;official&#8221; meaning &#8220;It&#8217;s actually going to be debugged and stuff for the next couple weeks, but for sanity purposes, it&#8217;s &#8216;done&#8217;&#8221;). Also last Friday was the end of spring quarter, in which I took a class about empirical research and learned some fundamental but important things like, <i>qualitative research is not meant to be judged on its external validity, but rather it&#8217;s transferability.</i>&nbsp;The former is the extent to which findings can be &#8220;generalized&#8221; to the broader world; the latter is the extent to which findings may be found under certain limitations and settings, which have to be defined by the researchers. Subtle.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve also been playing a lot of Diablo 3, despite my deep discomfort with the fact that the only playable dark-skinned character is a witch doctor. Like &#8211; really? <i>Witch doctor?</i>&nbsp;The only playable black person is a spasming, exotified mush of skull masks and voodoo-flavored equips? When this is brought up in conversation circles the immediately following statement always seems to be, <i>But, but the (spoilers) fallen angel of justice is black,</i>&nbsp;as if this suddenly makes witch doctor okay, and I guess it&#8217;s soothing if what&#8217;s important is that the games you play be falsely &#8220;perfect&#8221; enough to not be worth critical analysis.<br /><br />That being said, I&#8217;m still enjoying <strike>my social slot machine pinata game</strike> Diablo, though the amount of enjoyment dims a bit into grimacing cynicism every time I find an article about its psychological trickery, <a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2012/06/the-psychology-of-diablo-iii-loot-part-1-anchoring-the-auction-house/">like this one</a>.<br /><br />Since it came out recently, and since my next project (and conceivably all future projects from now on) involve free-to-play games, I&#8217;ve also been playing Nimblebit&#8217;s recently released Pocket Planes to see what I can glean from its charming pixelated ailerons. &nbsp;In Pocket Planes, you construct your very own airline empire, overseeing the passage of travelers and unusual cargo from city to city.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HE6RKZhOzew/T-UPXNKS8-I/AAAAAAAABNM/-lXQ2VVwMY0/s1600/photo+(2).PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HE6RKZhOzew/T-UPXNKS8-I/AAAAAAAABNM/-lXQ2VVwMY0/s640/photo+(2).PNG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">my plane, named &#8220;faire,&#8221; since the colors seemed kinda fair-like</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">In particular I was struggling with how I could make an &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; of goals, something that wouldn&#8217;t require an endless content feed or &#8220;leveling up,&#8221; some system that could provide its player prodding naturally and grow without much goading and prodding on my part. &nbsp;Something that&#8217;s nice about Pocket Planes is that, whenever you view the map, you see your &#8220;goals:&#8221; all those faded-out cities.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: right;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UOydUvvtrSY/T-UPWVmPETI/AAAAAAAABNE/FO1RT3b_qOk/s1600/photo+(1).PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UOydUvvtrSY/T-UPWVmPETI/AAAAAAAABNE/FO1RT3b_qOk/s640/photo+(1).PNG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">seoul, i will get you soon enough</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I recently tried Kairosoft&#8217;s recent Epic Astro Story as well, and it had the same sort of carrot-dangling &#8211; faded out areas with rocket ships and caves waiting to explore. In some ways I feel like it&#8217;s more fun to decide where you want to expand into as well, given the little bit of information. &nbsp;Maybe it&#8217;s also ~*intrinsic*~, since you know that you&#8217;re getting <i>something</i>&nbsp;when you expand, but there&#8217;s still a surprise and mystery concerning what you can do with it.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2evvfoNGiVM/T-UPX62K-lI/AAAAAAAABNU/6TWOKJeezhw/s1600/photo.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2evvfoNGiVM/T-UPX62K-lI/AAAAAAAABNU/6TWOKJeezhw/s400/photo.PNG" width="266" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of epic astro story, lite version</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Something that I like about both games is that they have warm little cores of personalization/personality. In Pocket Planes, you can color your planes how you like, you can name them, you can outfit their pilots so they have unexpectedly bright facial hair, you can bring the Rosetta Stone from Nagasaki to Sendai, you can bring an ambiguously George Washington-dressed person to Vladivostok. &nbsp;In Epic Astro Story, you have individual citizens with their own names and their own households and preferences. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the sort of thing that I&#8217;m having a hard time finding a parallel for for the amusement park simulation, since amusement parks don&#8217;t really have little fictional people with natural needs (like work/leisure/exploration) to inhabit them.<br /><br />Recently one of my coworkers admitted that he had never been to Disneyland and was going in the near future, and as soon as people found out they&#8217;ve been taking time to cross vast distances to reach his desk, after which some thirty minutes to an hour will be spent bestowing upon said coworker nostalgic stories and adamant recommendations about Disneyland. &nbsp;&#8221;<i>I remember the first time I did X, I felt so [scared/excited/happy]&#8230;it&#8217;s been years now but I really want to go back!&#8221;</i>&nbsp;I wish I could capture this sense of excitement, this sort of <i>exuberant memory essence </i>for this amusement park game, but I haven&#8217;t yet been able to come up with much except perhaps randomly generated events where a little fake visitor will say, &#8220;I remember visiting this Fun Bounce in my youth, I love it!&#8221;<br /><br />I kind of wish I could visit Disneyland again just to see if inspiration would strike.</div>
