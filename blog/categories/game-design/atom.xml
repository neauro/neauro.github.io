<p class="caption">dragon master elves?!</p>


<p>Last Friday we hit up a small pub table and inconspicuously played J&rsquo;s copy of Small World, <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/">&ldquo;the fun, zany, light-hearted civilization board game!&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote>Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci™, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs and even humans; who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth. (<a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>This game has some disturbing colonialization themes aside; there are even pre-existing people in some territorites that you must conquer to inhabit that territory. Even so, I enjoyed this game so much that I eyed it hungrily at Card Kingdom after our party dispersed. The delicious flavor! The cool (albeit almost entirely white) characters! I love that the game naturally becomes different each time as you mix &ldquo;race powers&rdquo; and &ldquo;special powers;&rdquo; I love that the flavor of the game itself, its pictures and words, are delicious and meaningful and fly off the cardboard and became us — as in the terrifying era of K&rsquo;s Pillaging Skeletons, uprooting their femurs from mountain and farmland and laying waste across nests of Flying Trolls and Berserk Humans, resting for only a moment before rising again in greater number. <em>What</em>.</p>

<p>One weak part of the game, however, are the victory points. They are called gold; if you have the most of them at the end of the game, You Win. Flavor-wise, I don&rsquo;t feel like they entirely fit — when, during all this conquest, does gold arbitrary rise from the depths? — and there&rsquo;s also not much that you can do with them, other than occasionally exchange them to get the race you want. During the &ldquo;conquest&rdquo; phase, they are useless. What if instead you could use them to do something like increase your number of troops, and gamble to try and get more land? What if you needed to pay coins in order to roll for reinforcement, an action that is otherwise totally free and something you usually want to do? It seems like a missed opportunity for <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2010/03/flydrill-and-logistical-gameplay.html">logistical gameplay</a>, and allowing players the pleasure of &ldquo;not simply doing something, but doing it well — optimizing it to perfection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A also noted that, though he felt he had made the right &ldquo;decisions,&rdquo; he still placed last in our group of four, and didn&rsquo;t grasp how he could have played the game better. He didn&rsquo;t feel that he had &ldquo;gained experience&rdquo; and learned how to play the game any better. Though I can&rsquo;t find it now, it reminds me of what I have read once regarding <a href="http://spryfox.com/our-games/tripletown/">Triple Town</a>, and how it seems to be a simple game until you make a mistake — <em>and then you get it</em>, you get what the game is about, you feel excited to give it another go.</p>

<p>I hope to try out the expansions sometime, though the use of &ldquo;gypsy&rdquo; as a race in one of them is disconcerting, and reminds me of how uncomfortable the overall theme is.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend I finally learned about football, something I&rsquo;ve never been terribly interested in. The most recent game I watched was Kind Of A Big Deal for the city I live in.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/sea2.jpg" alt="Rain and cars and a distant Seattle Space Needle."/></p>

<p class="caption">distant space needle.</a></p>


<p>It strikes me that football is an incredibly fun game to watch because the &ldquo;four downs&rdquo; system provides a multitude of little goals to rejoice about. Each play is rife with struggle, with a victory that can turn into loss in an instant. It reminds me of Mark Rosewater&rsquo;s description of <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/174">interaction and a catch-up feature</a> as things that &ldquo;every game needs.&rdquo; At each &ldquo;down,&rdquo; both teams have the potential not just to stop each other, but to improve their own standing. It&rsquo;s a powerful interval.</p>

<p>Watching the game this past weekend was the first time in my life that I really, finally <em>got</em> it. I didn&rsquo;t know there were separate offensive and defensive teams; I didn&rsquo;t know that there were people whose singular jobs were to run, or to kick, and that the had individual tutors. It&rsquo;s pretty inspiring.</p>

    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/01/08/inventathon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A is starting a certificate program in game design this quarter and I&rsquo;ve been helping him with his card game, Invent-o-thon.</p>

<p>The prompt being something related to <em>Victorian Combat</em>, he first went around researching what people &ldquo;first thought of when they think about the Victorian Era,&rdquo; and I was happy to hammer in the presence of Ada Lovelace, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">The World&rsquo;s First Computer Programmer</a>. Because I&rsquo;m more interested in stories, I also talked with him about stories — in particular, making noteworthy experiences that people are excited to talk to each other about after the fact. Or, in general, creating situations in which people&rsquo;s imaginations are prompted and stretch and fill in ridiculous gaps.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/inventothon/playtest1.jpg" alt="What is a faith-powered tummy mobile?"/></p>

<p class="caption">what is a faith-powered tummy mobile FIGURE IT OUT DO IT</p>


<p>A obtained a bunch of card sleeves and post-it notes for our paper prototyping. The point of the game is to create an invention over several rounds, then present it at &ldquo;showtime&rdquo; to everyone and roll dice to see if your invention explodes. Thus far, players construct machines using three decks: one deck to describe a &ldquo;power source&rdquo; (like &ldquo;electric&rdquo;), one deck to describe a &ldquo;subject&rdquo; (like &ldquo;kittens&rdquo;), and one deck to describe the actual invention (like &ldquo;generator&rdquo;).</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/inventothon/playtest1_cards.JPG" alt="Playtest cards"/></p>

<p class="caption">physically impossible bathtub packer</p>


<p>We also gathered friends to do a playtest at a cafe.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/inventothon/playtest2.jpg" alt="Playtest cards"/></p>

<p class="caption">kind of pathetic pleasure chamber...and others</p>


<p>One of the most valuable things learned from prototyping was which cards were compelling and funny, and which cards weren&rsquo;t — descriptive cards that seemed perfectly fine, like &ldquo;hydro-powered&rdquo; or &ldquo;solar-powered,&rdquo; were just not as fun to use as &ldquo;perfectly ordinary&rdquo; or &ldquo;rather moist&rdquo; and never quite made it to showtime. It makes sense that something like &ldquo;perfectly ordinary&rdquo; lights up more parts of your story-minded brain than &ldquo;hydro-powered,&rdquo; and overall could have more flavor. (What&rsquo;s a &ldquo;perfectly ordinary kitten-mobile&rdquo;?)</p>

<p>I sketched out some possibilities for card designs&hellip;</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/inventothon/cardsketch.jpg" alt="Sketches of cards"/></p>

<p class="caption">sketches of cards</p>


<p>&hellip;and A also reined in his sister for some concept art of character roles that players could have that affected their inventions. For example, someone who was Benjamin Franklin might be able to totally swap inventions with someone else before showtime. (Oo! Sick burn!)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OO6Fgnn7kNU/UE4O8ZEDLCI/AAAAAAAACag/yGjzQ0zMHrQ/s640/blogger-image-1812206283.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OO6Fgnn7kNU/UE4O8ZEDLCI/AAAAAAAACag/yGjzQ0zMHrQ/s640/blogger-image-1812206283.jpg" /></a></div><br />I haven't been playing iOS games recently, I guess due to a general boredom with the growing free-to-play population. The exception is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/dragon-flight/id530610467?mt=8">Dragon Flight</a> by Next Floor, a simple dragon-themed shooter. Long story short: put your finger over the character, swipe left and right to eliminate rows of evil/cute monsters, collect the coins and jewels upon expelled upon monsters' expiration.<br /><br />Coins gathered mid-fray can be used to purchase increasingly expensive upgrades, which make your bullets cooler-looking and faster at killing things, which is nice. The system is clean-cut: farm dragons, upgrade to farm dragons better, farm more dragons. In the background is a high score based on how many meters you were able to cross before dying, which provides a pretty sensible long-term goal in each individual, short game. There are also power-ups you can collect mid-fray ("shoot twice as many bullets;" "become invincible and shoot forward for two seconds or so;" etc.) which mix things up a little.<br /><br />About the only bewildering thing to me is the other score system, which allots you points based on the types of dragons you killed, white dragons yielding like 100 points and tougher, yellow ones yielding 500 (or something). And sometimes when you kill a dragon a "2x" or "3x" or something pops up overhead? I'm still not sure what this means, though presumably it rewards the player for going on streaks of killing only a certain color of dragon, which is difficult to plan out when rows of randomly-arranged dragons appear and rush away in the space of seconds. I've been musing about what purpose having both a score based on "This is how far you went!" and a "This is how many points you won!" score might serve. For example, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris#Scoring">Tetris</a>,&nbsp;clearing lines as soon as possible help you stay in the game longer (and keeps your stress level low), whereas making a "tetris" or clearing four lines at once rewards more points.<br /><br />Anyway, I haven't found my answer yet, but it may be because all I care about is farming dragons (<i>give me that 8000 coin dragon egg dammit omg</i>).<br /><br />Other slightly annoying thing: placing your finger directly over the player-character to navigate her obstructs her from view, which means it can be hard to catch falling treasure. Because the screen reads movement no matter where your finger is, I experimented with navigating the player-character while holding my finger near the top of the screen, but then I couldn't see where I was shooting. I haven't thought of any possible alternatives yet for this, other than tilt-based controlling, which seems like it would be too slow for twitchy treasure-catching.<br /><br />Anyway~ Dragon Flight is a simple and satisfying time-waster, but I can't wait until I can replace it with gardening and Return to Ravnica :D</div>

<i>This quarter I am facilitating a game design class at Puget Sound Community School for fun and lols. &nbsp;This is my story.</i><br /><br /><i>Other weeks can be found <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">here</a>.</i><br /><br />Last week's game was <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/587905">/ ESCAPE \</a>. &nbsp;It's a simple yet compelling game; you press the escape key to wall-jump, timing it right so you don't get&nbsp;electrocuted&nbsp;by spikes embedded by the walls or the huge laser approaching you from the bottom.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;
