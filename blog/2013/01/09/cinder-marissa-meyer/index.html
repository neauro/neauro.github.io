A deadly plague ravages the population. From space, a ruthless lunar people watch, waiting to make their move. No one knows that Earth’s fate hinges on one girl&#8230; <br /><br />Cinder, a gifted mechanic, is a cyborg. She’s a second-class citizen with a mysterious past, reviled by her stepmother and blamed for her stepsister’s illness. But when her life becomes intertwined with the handsome Prince Kai’s, she suddenly finds herself at the center of an intergalactic struggle, and a forbidden attraction. Caught between duty and freedom, loyalty and betrayal, she must uncover secrets about her past in order to protect her world’s future.</em></blockquote><br />I just finished reading <em>Cinder</em> by Marissa Meyer and absolutely loved it, and am still trying to figure out why. It came with recommendations from some friends and Tumblr, whose endorsement loosened my fear that a &#8220;New Beijing&#8221; setting would be filled with all manner of gross exotifications a la <a href="http://beyondvictoriana.com/2010/02/13/beyond-victoriana-14-the-wind-up-girl-guest-review-by-jaymee-goh/">other future Asia books</a>. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t!<br /><br />I wavered a little when the love interest, Prince <strike>Charming</strike> Kai was introduced; off the bat he is introduced as having &#8220;copper-colored&#8221; eyes and a plethora of shrieking fangirls (really). Though I still could have done without the fangirls, Prince Kai on his own was fine — more than a love interest with swoon-inducing eyes, a perfectly tortured too-young politician with bangs and occasional sad gazes and statements. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he says at some point, &#8220;I guess I really should give up my life for my people :&#8217;(&#8221;<br /><br />(Sometimes this is exactly what I want. This is one of those times.)<br /><br />Cinder herself is a great cyborg. She isn&#8217;t just furnished with metal parts, she <em>is</em> them. She notes when her software tells her people lying; she escapes embarrassing moments due to her inability to blush; her moments of panic are accompanied by suggestions that she take deep breaths to decrease heightened levels of adrenaline. If there&#8217;s anything else I wanted out of this story&#8217;s cyborgness, it&#8217;s more of a reason why cyborgs are hated; at some point her stepmother snaps that Cinder can&#8217;t really feel anything, can she, but this just doesn&#8217;t seem reason enough for a society-deep fear and disdain. Maybe if there had been some big incident that made everything cling to and guard their own humanity as something they cherished, &#8220;true&#8221; emotions and all? (Maybe if this incident was related to the Luna?)<br /><br />One of the story&#8217;s Big Twists is something easy to call from the first 50 pages. Though I was tempted to feel disdained, after reading <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2013/01/books-of-2012.html">Wired for Story</a> and its mantra that &#8220;reads love to find delight in figuring out what&#8217;s going on!&#8221; I&#8217;m giving it a second thought. After all, it <em>is</em> pretty fun to know the secret from the beginning — to see Cinder dodge it — to know what&#8217;s really going on.<br /><br />Another aspect of this story that&#8217;s pretty cool is the amount of <em>stuff</em> going on — Cinder&#8217;s tension with her family, Cinder&#8217;s mysterious past, Cinder&#8217;s being hated as a cyborg, the soon-to-be-emperor, the psychic aliens, the plague. For the most part, however, all of these things were all tied together and impact Cinder and the events in the story.<br /><br />Ultimately, <em>Cinder</em> was a fantastic story about a character who gets disadvantaged and broken up again and again and continues to persevere and stick to her principles.<br /><br />[ spoilers ]<br /><br />That being said, I do wish that the Big Twist — that Cinder is Princess <strike>Serena</strike> Selene of the moon — had been played with a little more. For example, the character Dr. Erland clearly knows Cinder&#8217;s secret, and persists in lying to her about it, and this serves as a shallow obstacle, since there&#8217;s nothing about Dr. Erland that makes you suspect him or his motives. So he&#8217;s lying to Cinder — so what? It isn&#8217;t affecting anything, she isn&#8217;t going to be hurt by it. Imagine instead of Dr. Erland were more sinister — if you knew he knew Cinder&#8217;s identity, and if every time Cinder entered the room with him you were crying for her to just get out of there before something awful happened — that would have been <i>great</i>.</div>
