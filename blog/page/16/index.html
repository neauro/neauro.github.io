I&#8217;ve started another story. &nbsp;I&#8217;m confident about this one. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t finish last year&#8217;s <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/2011-nanowrimo-limning.html">NaNo</a>&nbsp;but I&#8217;m&nbsp;placing my palms on it, shoving and shoving until its sputum can be resurrected as a passable plot.<br /><br />Mmm.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve discovered (not unexpectedly) that writing on the computer is, for me, a lost cause. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MyzI0jY_Bzk/TytZ60DNvkI/AAAAAAAAAos/Ch2z_vwGufc/s1600/472d84164e1a11e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MyzI0jY_Bzk/TytZ60DNvkI/AAAAAAAAAos/Ch2z_vwGufc/s320/472d84164e1a11e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i&#8217;m going to run out of moleskine soon</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There are too many distractions. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been weaned too well to the Information Age. &nbsp;A newly-transferred Twitter packet is the sweetest nectar. &nbsp;The &#8220;(1)&#8221; notification that appears to the left of the title of my Facebook tab sends my endorphins flying (though 90% of the time it&#8217;s just a request from CastleVille).<br /><br />I&#8217;ve also started assembling a playlist of songs Pandora has suggested to me, which I&#8217;ve found surprisingly stirring of the misery-hope emotions that fuel my inspiration so well. &nbsp;You can find it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD2A04B5DCB06A2D9">here</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLD2A04B5DCB06A2D9&amp;hl=en_US" width="560"></iframe></center><br /><br />Last but not least, an excerpt which I hope won&#8217;t jinx my endeavors:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;It will feel better once you open your eyes,&#8221; Candle suggested, sounding shameful now, &#8220;sorry I can&#8217;t keep it smooth,&#8221; but though Win indeed felt sick, she couldn&#8217;t bring herself to do it &#8211; to open her eyes, to look down and realize that she was miles away from home.  If she fell, how long would it take for her to return?  To fall past Quartzal and Agatava and all of Tenor Anthem, the journey that had taken days in elevators, in short trains weaving on zippered tracks past caves of stationary monsters, in carriages fixed to the back of cliffdragons whose gangly shoulderblades made the entire carriage sway as they navigated aggressive granite striae.  The journey of days could be undone in hours of freefall.  Minutes, if she didn&#8217;t hit anything.</blockquote></div>

It says that you can borrow a book a month, but I think (<em>think</em>) that you can borrow a single book per month, but return it if you want to get another book before the time is up.  I am unclear on this and cannot completely verify yet, having difficulties finding the answer and also having not loaned out anything for a complete month yet.  The collection is enormous and what you&#8217;ll notice about it immediately is the presence of The Hunger Games, the poster child of the Lending Library, a little medal of, <em>Look!  There are even recent, popular books here!  For free (for $49/year)!</em><br /><br /><h3>  You can borrow ebooks from the Seattle Public Library.</h3>The waiting lists are long, but there are enough &#8220;unpopular&#8221; books to tide you over until the holds let up.  You can have holds on 25 books maximum.  You can borrow 25 books maximum, each for up to 21 days maximum.  Here&#8217;s the tricky thing that took me an annoying while to figure out: returning books is not done through the Seattle Public Library&#8217;s <a href="http://spl.lib.overdrive.com/">online site</a>, but through the &#8220;Manage Your Kindle&#8221; link on Amazon.com.<br /><br />Browsing the ebook collection is also frustratingly tedious &#8211; more on that later.  Suffice to say that browsing ebooks is something I reserve for mindlessly doing between builds.<br /><br /><h3>  There are tons of public domain books available on Amazon for free.</h3>They are odds and ends of things, but I really enjoy random tidbits like <em>Character</em> and <em>Home Vegetable Gardening -a Complete and Practical Guide to the Planting and Care of All Vegetables, Fruits and Berries Worth Growing for Home Use</em>, so, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/The%20http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;node=154606011&amp;redirect=true&amp;sort=daterank&amp;field-price=0-0">there</a> you go!</div>

<i>This quarter I am facilitating a game design class at Puget Sound Community School for fun and lols. &nbsp;This is my story.</i><br /><br /><i>Other weeks can be found <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">here</a>.</i><br /><br />I&#8217;m a little belated with this post, if not just because I personally felt &#8220;meh&#8221; about it (which probably means that it might have been worse for the students themselves). &nbsp;Firstly, we critiqued Making Monkeys.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eyjfrSSrYVU/Tyd9DbYC5xI/AAAAAAAAAoc/HBrzqgLtUhs/s1600/makingmonkeys.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="460" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eyjfrSSrYVU/Tyd9DbYC5xI/AAAAAAAAAoc/HBrzqgLtUhs/s640/makingmonkeys.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of making monkeys, by <a href="http://greg-anims.com/">greg-anims</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />The general consensus was that it was fun, unique, challenging. &nbsp;We pointed out the nice progression of the levels &#8211; each one had something new to learn &#8211; and talked about the types of rewards and goals in the design: the short-term win of the coffee cup, the long-term win of the entire game with your progress laid out visibly. &nbsp;The little narratives acted as both a silly reward for the previous level and a hint for the upcoming level. &nbsp;Some students found bugs but I didn&#8217;t write any of them down, so they&#8217;re Lost in Time and Space now.<br /><br />I couldn&#8217;t think of a topic that I felt like discussing, so I chose <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2006/03/performance_met.html">this article</a> at random from a list of game design resources <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/">Alex</a> gave me and just tried to talk about it, whiteboard and all. &nbsp;It was not too compelling and people were distracted, probably because &#8220;me talking&#8221; wasn&#8217;t that intriguing.<br /><br />I switched topics then to the difference between &#8220;hardcore&#8221; and &#8220;casual&#8221; gaming, just to see what people thought of it (again referencing <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2007/08/game-literacy.html">another article from Only a Game</a>). &nbsp;Some of the students were adamant that the labels didn&#8217;t mean anything, that &#8220;people just love games&#8221; and stereotypes seek to destroy the simple, human integrity of us all, to which I agree, kinda. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve always felt something snubby about declarations of <i>I&#8217;m a hardcore gamer </i>when all the game companies I&#8217;ve worked at have legitimate, game-loving audiences who can play just as much as any COD player, just doesn&#8217;t relish the violence or complexity of it.<br /><br />An interesting term I learned in relation to the hardcore/casual duality was the idea of &#8220;game literacy;&#8221; that maybe an important delineation between hardcore and casual is not necessarily the time spent playing, or the motivations, but the breadth of game knowledge in general, and the ease with which one could pick up another game.<br /><br />Another idea was &#8220;game depth,&#8221; and I tried to tie this together with ideas of winning and losing from earlier &#8211; what happens in games when you &#8220;never really lose,&#8221; but just have opportunities to achieve better, a la Angry Birds? &nbsp;What kind of decisions can you make in a game that is shallow, and one that has depth? &nbsp;How important are those decisions to the game itself? &nbsp;In Angry Birds, you can choose your angle and your velocity; in Tetris, your rotatation and speed; in a game like Magic, you can choose your deck, your strategy, your technique. &nbsp;It always seems like games with depth are &#8220;better,&#8221; but I adore Limbo and concede that it&#8217;s shallow gameplay-wise &#8211; you solve the puzzles, you get to the end, that&#8217;s it. &nbsp;I love story, but &#8220;Game&#8221; in its unique form is something that can be cooked and devoured a thousand times and still taste different the thousand and first.</div>

We went to Greenlake Games first with a couple of friends, where every table had a nice mat and every participant received a nifty Companion Cube-looking <a href="http://irondie.com/">Irondie</a>.<br /><br />Sealed competitions go like this:<br /><ol><li>Get 6 packs of cards (in this case, 3 of Dark Ascension, 3 of Innistrad)</li><li>Open everything</li><li>Make a 40-card deck</li><li>FIGHT</li></ol>First pack rare: Geist of Saint Traft.  <em>AHHHH</em>.  And in the same pack: Instigator Gang!<br /><br />I was also excited to try and get some <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/01/mtg-lambholt-elder.html">Lambholt Elders</a> and ended up just getting three of them in all of my Dark Ascension packs (and even a holographic one!).<br /><br />In the end I created a green/white deck splashing both blue and red for Geist and Instigator.  I&#8217;ve never tried to use four colors before and felt super risky (oftentimes I would take a 5-mana hand just because I had all the colors in it), but when I was not completely mana-screwed I actually did fairly well!  I won three of my four sets and won six extra booster packs.<br /><br />Some memorable moments:<br /><ul><li>In one game: I attacked with Pitchburn Devils, dealt 3 damage to the other player, then next turn brought Pitchburn back with Haunted Fengraf, sacrificed him to equip Somberwald Dryad with Demonmail Hauberk, dealt 3 damage to the other player, then swung with Somberwald who was unblockable due to Forestwalk.  The last point of damage was done by casting Fling and sacrificing my 1/2 Lambholt Elder, haha.</li><li>In my last game: me and the other player were down to <em>dat wire</em>, him with a Galvanic Juggernaut that kept coming back upright with the undying death of his Young Wolf.  I took three hits for 15 damage from the Juggernaut but then was at exactly 5 health, which triggered the Fateful Hour of my Thraben Doomsayer and buffed both my Silverpelt Werewolf and Somberwald Dryad.  It was close until Andou came by to check out our game and realized that we had both forgotten all about the Fateful hour for the Village Survivors that I had out, since it was covered up by a Chant of the Skifsang &#8211; at which point I swung with all my Vigilant creatures and it was over.</li><li>In another game: my first hand had two plains, three forests, a Thraben Doomsayer, and a Gravetiller Wurm.  Over the course of the next couple turns I spawned a human, brought Gravetiller in with Morbid, equipped him with a Demonmail Hauberk and some more Morbid counters thanks to a Hunger of the Howlpack and another human token, and, there it was: a massive 15/13 monster trampling everywhere.</li></ul><br />I have Lorin to thank for making full use of Demonmail, since he cleaned me out with it at <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/12/mtg-my-second-ever-draft.html">our last draft</a> and before that point I hadn&#8217;t made the connection between Demonmail and how easy it made triggering Morbid since I could sacrifice a creature whenever I wished.  Andou read some of the design notes for this set to me; the point of Dark Ascension is that everything is getting dark and awful and worse, the world is teeming with monsters, and I definitely felt the design encouraging me to kill things, to take advantage of death, especially of that of meager 1/1 Human tokens.  Fateful Hour was also fun to trigger, though being at the point of death stresses me out, and in general during all the games playing with strangers I could feel my hands shaking with competitive tension.<br /><br />Later our group went over to The Dreaming to do <em>another</em> sealed tourney, but I didn&#8217;t do so well in that one, so, the only memorable moment I&#8217;ve got is when Andou pulled a Huntmaster of the Fells and later gave it to me.

The Mexican character was, unfortunately, the subject of many a boob-shot, and was also pretty frustratingly&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere">tsundere</a>&nbsp;at times; and in general the females all had the same, petite facial structure. &nbsp;Personality-wise, though, they were all strong and interesting, with motives that 100% did not involve getting with the men around them. &nbsp;(Though there was a bit of Maria/That Dark Brooding guy near the end&#8230;before he went back to his lifestyle of alternating between doing surgeries and jail-time.)<br /><br />Some bonus fangirling: the best part of this game, hands-down, were Kimishima&#8217;s cases. &nbsp;I <i>loved</i>&nbsp;piecing together the facts, figuring out how someone had died (though most of them were pretty straight-forward), learning about Kimishima&#8217;s weird &#8220;I can hear the dead&#8221; cellphone and the fact that other characters accepted that she had such a device without complaint (&#8220;You and your voodoo cellphone&#8230;&#8221;). &nbsp;Gabe Cunningham&#8217;s voice actor (apparently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Willingham">the same as for Roy in Full Metal Alchemist</a>) had <i>so much life</i>&nbsp;(the best part being when he sang &#8220;chunky~~&#8221; at the American politician). &nbsp;Also, Atlus&#8217;s bold, colorful interfaces are so&nbsp;fun to interact with.</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<i>This quarter I am facilitating a game design class at Puget Sound Community School for fun and lols. &nbsp;This is my story.</i><br /><br /><i>Other weeks can be found <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">here</a>.</i><br /><br />First thing last Tuesday was going over last week&#8217;s assigned game, <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/586994">Pixel 2</a>, which has some marvelously colorful particle effects. &nbsp;Since we had talked a bit about <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/01/pscs-game-design-class-week-2.html">tutorials</a>&nbsp;in the past class, I had asked everybody to keep an eye on how Pixel 2 teaches you how to play the game, and it turns out it does so pretty bluntly.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ypu35aRRuI0/Tx4n4pMgrUI/AAAAAAAAAnM/XCTY9HfIHbE/s1600/pixel2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="468" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ypu35aRRuI0/Tx4n4pMgrUI/AAAAAAAAAnM/XCTY9HfIHbE/s640/pixel2.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">pixel 2 tutorial screenshot</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Everyone agreed that the game was &#8220;pretty fun,&#8221; mostly because it was very satisfying to collect the pixels, and people enjoyed the way that pixels were shot out at enemies anytime you collected pixels. &nbsp;We also discovered the &#8220;teleportation&#8221; aspect of the game, but were mixed about whether it added to the game or not. &nbsp;The player is moved around with the mouse, and can be held stationary with the space bar while the mouse moves the gun around, shooting at surrounding enemies; but if you release the space bar, the player will automatically &#8220;teleport&#8221; to the mouse&#8217;s present position.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t get that far in the game due to lack of time and the fact that all the particles make my laptop run slowly, but the students also pointed out that some of the upgrades obtained in the game later are unlabeled, so their function is hard to remember.<br /><br />After that, we moved on to the topic for the day, which was reward systems. &nbsp;I referenced a lot of <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2005/08/designing_rewar.html">this overview on reward types</a>, though the students were able to name off some rewards easily: leveling up, getting money, getting new items, getting to explore new places. &nbsp;I talked about schedules for rewards, as well as what I felt was a pretty interesting point from that article:<br /><br /><blockquote>If you have ever wondered why games with poor game mechanics can still entertain players, it is perhaps because many poorly designed games are at least easy to play - and if they provide rewards according to a reliable schedule, they will entertain&#8230;it is the delivery of rewards, and not the quality of the game mechanics, which maintains a player&#8217;s interest.</blockquote><br />Case in point: &nbsp;FarmVille, and other games nowadays like EA&#8217;s Theme Park which rely on people optimizing for rewards (described with a fair amount of pessimism in <a href="http://insertcredit.com/2011/09/22/who-killed-videogames-a-ghost-story/">who killed video games?</a>).<br /><br />The next thing I talked about was how the rewards mentioned above were all extrinsic motivations, contrasted with intrinsic motivations, detailed wonderfully in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">this TEDTalk about &#8220;the surprising science of motivation&#8221;</a>:<br /><br /><br /><center><object height="374" width="526"> <param name="movie" value="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf"> </param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /> <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/> <param name="wmode" value="transparent"> </param><param name="bgColor" value="#ffffff"> </param><param name="flashvars" value="vu=http://video.ted.com/talk/stream/2009G/Blank/DanielPink_2009G-320k.mp4&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/DanielPink-2009G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&vw=512&vh=288&ap=0&ti=618&lang=&introDuration=15330&adDuration=4000&postAdDuration=830&adKeys=talk=dan_pink_on_motivation;year=2009;theme=the_creative_spark;theme=not_business_as_usual;event=TEDGlobal+2009;tag=Business;tag=Science;tag=brain;tag=creativity;tag=social+change;tag=work;&preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;" /> <embed src="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" pluginspace="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" bgColor="#ffffff" width="526" height="374" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" flashvars="vu=http://video.ted.com/talk/stream/2009G/Blank/DanielPink_2009G-320k.mp4&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/DanielPink-2009G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&vw=512&vh=288&ap=0&ti=618&lang=&introDuration=15330&adDuration=4000&postAdDuration=830&adKeys=talk=dan_pink_on_motivation;year=2009;theme=the_creative_spark;theme=not_business_as_usual;event=TEDGlobal+2009;tag=Business;tag=Science;tag=brain;tag=creativity;tag=social+change;tag=work;&preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;"></embed> </object></center><br /><br />As soon as I described the candle problem one of the students yelled, &#8220;What?! &nbsp;But that&#8217;s easy!&#8221; right off the bat, so I guess it just goes to show you how they&#8217;ve already been brought up with fancy intrinsic motivations (or maybe it just proves that I shouldn&#8217;t have drawn the box first, and then the tacks inside the box).<br /><br />Last topic was goals, the discussion of which I also referenced <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2007/05/process_without.html">Only a Game</a>&nbsp;as well as relevant HCI/UX points like <i>Show your player how far they&#8217;ve gotten! &nbsp;Show them all the things they&#8217;ve done! &nbsp;Short-term goals and long-term goals and transparent progress, yeah!</i><br /><br />With most topics I usually stop to let everyone try and see what video games may exhibit characteristics of whatever I&#8217;m talking about, which leads inevitably to fun tangential discussion about WoW, about achievements, about gamification and whether it works or not. &nbsp;The only unfortunate thing is that I haven&#8217;t played most of the games that they have, since the only console I own that came out in the past seven years is the Wii. &nbsp;Even playing flash games stresses out the machines I own.<br /><br />Another thing I learned personally is this: even if the class is going to be mostly discussion and mostly me talking, even if there&#8217;s no formal note-taking or tests, it&#8217;s<i>&nbsp;good </i>to be writing stuff on the board. &nbsp;The moment I markered out &#8220;extrinsic&#8221; people looked up from their laptop screens. &nbsp;Hurray!</div>

Are not reviews of current literature a perpetual illustration of the difficulty of judgment?  &#8220;This great book,&#8221; &#8220;this worthless book,&#8221; the same book is called by both names.  Praise and blame alike mean nothing.  No, delightful as the pastime of measuring may be, it is the most futile of all occupations, and to submit to the decrees of the measurers the most servile of attitudes.  So long as you write what you wish to write, that is all that matters; and whether it matters for ages or only for hours, nobody can say.</blockquote></div>
