I&#8217;m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.  You&#8217;ve got to find what you love, and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers.  Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.  And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.  If you haven&#8217;t found it yet, keep looking, and don&#8217;t settle.  As with all matters of the heart, you&#8217;ll know when you find it.  And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.  So keep looking.  Don&#8217;t settle.<br /><br />Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.  You are already naked.  There is no reason not to follow your heart.</blockquote><br /><br />My first class this week for my HCDE program started with the usual ice breakers, and led eventually to our professor hauling out dozens of <em>Wired</em> magazines from the early 90s, just as oddly textured and bright neon as the <em>Wired</em> magazines of present day.  One of the first things that I saw in my Septemer 1998 issue was an advertisement for FAT32, Microsoft&#8217;s newest, fastest and most efficient file system.  One of the main features of this particular issue was Furby, and there was also a smaller article whose intent was to &#8220;debunk memes;&#8221; Bluetooth, it said, was estimated to be a hot topic for about the next 24 months, and would only really be marketable once portable devices like PDAs came to be everywhere.  <em>And even then, people looking to move data between gadgets might find it hard to sever their emotional connection to the entrenched wireline option.</em><br /><br />We started sharing articles.  Someone mentioned that in his issue, Apple was bringing back Steve Jobs as a consultant, and our professor said, &#8220;And that pretty much saved the company, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221;<br /><br />I guess it&#8217;s strange to think that this history of &#8220;silly technology&#8221; &#8211; digital cameras boasting a whole three feet of electrical cord, failed internet &#8220;walled gardens&#8221; like AOL and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)">Prodigy</a> &#8211; is really quite young.  The Macintosh computer (pitched to shareholders in 1984) was the first commercially successful computer with a graphical user interface, and that computer, for me, is the cornerstone of what I&#8217;m studying now.  Human-Computer Interaction is not only my academic focus but something that permeates <em>my life</em>; I am at a computer or interacting with things thanks to computers throughout my day more often than I am not.  Working, writing papers for class, corresponding, paying bills, learning about health insurance and oppression and red spider lilies&#8230;<br /><br />COOL MAN, STEVE.  I&#8217;m glad that technology&#8217;s history (and future?) is marked not with <em>Let&#8217;s use this to get all the money</em>, but rather with, <em>Let&#8217;s do this because this is what we love.</em></div>
