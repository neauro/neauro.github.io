<i>This quarter I am facilitating a game design class at Puget Sound Community School for fun and lols. &nbsp;This is my story.</i><br /><br /><i>Other weeks can be found <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">here</a>.</i><br /><br />First thing last Tuesday was going over last week&#8217;s assigned game, <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/586994">Pixel 2</a>, which has some marvelously colorful particle effects. &nbsp;Since we had talked a bit about <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/01/pscs-game-design-class-week-2.html">tutorials</a>&nbsp;in the past class, I had asked everybody to keep an eye on how Pixel 2 teaches you how to play the game, and it turns out it does so pretty bluntly.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ypu35aRRuI0/Tx4n4pMgrUI/AAAAAAAAAnM/XCTY9HfIHbE/s1600/pixel2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="468" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ypu35aRRuI0/Tx4n4pMgrUI/AAAAAAAAAnM/XCTY9HfIHbE/s640/pixel2.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">pixel 2 tutorial screenshot</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Everyone agreed that the game was &#8220;pretty fun,&#8221; mostly because it was very satisfying to collect the pixels, and people enjoyed the way that pixels were shot out at enemies anytime you collected pixels. &nbsp;We also discovered the &#8220;teleportation&#8221; aspect of the game, but were mixed about whether it added to the game or not. &nbsp;The player is moved around with the mouse, and can be held stationary with the space bar while the mouse moves the gun around, shooting at surrounding enemies; but if you release the space bar, the player will automatically &#8220;teleport&#8221; to the mouse&#8217;s present position.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t get that far in the game due to lack of time and the fact that all the particles make my laptop run slowly, but the students also pointed out that some of the upgrades obtained in the game later are unlabeled, so their function is hard to remember.<br /><br />After that, we moved on to the topic for the day, which was reward systems. &nbsp;I referenced a lot of <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2005/08/designing_rewar.html">this overview on reward types</a>, though the students were able to name off some rewards easily: leveling up, getting money, getting new items, getting to explore new places. &nbsp;I talked about schedules for rewards, as well as what I felt was a pretty interesting point from that article:<br /><br /><blockquote>If you have ever wondered why games with poor game mechanics can still entertain players, it is perhaps because many poorly designed games are at least easy to play - and if they provide rewards according to a reliable schedule, they will entertain&#8230;it is the delivery of rewards, and not the quality of the game mechanics, which maintains a player&#8217;s interest.</blockquote><br />Case in point: &nbsp;FarmVille, and other games nowadays like EA&#8217;s Theme Park which rely on people optimizing for rewards (described with a fair amount of pessimism in <a href="http://insertcredit.com/2011/09/22/who-killed-videogames-a-ghost-story/">who killed video games?</a>).<br /><br />The next thing I talked about was how the rewards mentioned above were all extrinsic motivations, contrasted with intrinsic motivations, detailed wonderfully in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">this TEDTalk about &#8220;the surprising science of motivation&#8221;</a>:<br /><br /><br /><center><object height="374" width="526"> <param name="movie" value="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf"> </param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /> <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/> <param name="wmode" value="transparent"> </param><param name="bgColor" value="#ffffff"> </param><param name="flashvars" value="vu=http://video.ted.com/talk/stream/2009G/Blank/DanielPink_2009G-320k.mp4&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/DanielPink-2009G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&vw=512&vh=288&ap=0&ti=618&lang=&introDuration=15330&adDuration=4000&postAdDuration=830&adKeys=talk=dan_pink_on_motivation;year=2009;theme=the_creative_spark;theme=not_business_as_usual;event=TEDGlobal+2009;tag=Business;tag=Science;tag=brain;tag=creativity;tag=social+change;tag=work;&preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;" /> <embed src="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" pluginspace="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" bgColor="#ffffff" width="526" height="374" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" flashvars="vu=http://video.ted.com/talk/stream/2009G/Blank/DanielPink_2009G-320k.mp4&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/DanielPink-2009G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&vw=512&vh=288&ap=0&ti=618&lang=&introDuration=15330&adDuration=4000&postAdDuration=830&adKeys=talk=dan_pink_on_motivation;year=2009;theme=the_creative_spark;theme=not_business_as_usual;event=TEDGlobal+2009;tag=Business;tag=Science;tag=brain;tag=creativity;tag=social+change;tag=work;&preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;"></embed> </object></center><br /><br />As soon as I described the candle problem one of the students yelled, &#8220;What?! &nbsp;But that&#8217;s easy!&#8221; right off the bat, so I guess it just goes to show you how they&#8217;ve already been brought up with fancy intrinsic motivations (or maybe it just proves that I shouldn&#8217;t have drawn the box first, and then the tacks inside the box).<br /><br />Last topic was goals, the discussion of which I also referenced <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2007/05/process_without.html">Only a Game</a>&nbsp;as well as relevant HCI/UX points like <i>Show your player how far they&#8217;ve gotten! &nbsp;Show them all the things they&#8217;ve done! &nbsp;Short-term goals and long-term goals and transparent progress, yeah!</i><br /><br />With most topics I usually stop to let everyone try and see what video games may exhibit characteristics of whatever I&#8217;m talking about, which leads inevitably to fun tangential discussion about WoW, about achievements, about gamification and whether it works or not. &nbsp;The only unfortunate thing is that I haven&#8217;t played most of the games that they have, since the only console I own that came out in the past seven years is the Wii. &nbsp;Even playing flash games stresses out the machines I own.<br /><br />Another thing I learned personally is this: even if the class is going to be mostly discussion and mostly me talking, even if there&#8217;s no formal note-taking or tests, it&#8217;s<i>&nbsp;good </i>to be writing stuff on the board. &nbsp;The moment I markered out &#8220;extrinsic&#8221; people looked up from their laptop screens. &nbsp;Hurray!</div>
