    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-S3g0jRylQ1A/UE4fWvHOgMI/AAAAAAAACbc/JITahodS8LA/s1600/ravnica.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="514" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-S3g0jRylQ1A/UE4fWvHOgMI/AAAAAAAACbc/JITahodS8LA/s640/ravnica.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of <a href="http://guildsofravnica.com/">guildsofravnica.com</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I've been following the developments of the new block of Magic cards, my fervor for them having not waned with the passing of werewolf creatures. It helps that the next block is Ravnica, which I had always admired for its gorgeous lands; an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenopolis">ecumenopolis</a>, it's the sort of world I would be hard-pressed to find alternatives for (unlike Innistrad's "gothic horror" world, for example).<br /><br />One social network advertising construct that WOTC is employing to hype up the release is this <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/leaderboard">guild leaderboard</a>&nbsp;thing where you can join a guild of your choice and start earning points for it by participating in certain activities, like answering daily online quizzes. "Which card art has better sound effects?" "Which card art is better for doing chores?"<br /><br />Here's an unattractive but functional pie chart of the current points breakdown:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kw0fBjSarQQ/UE4iFz6D0SI/AAAAAAAACcY/MBqAXxsOsNQ/s1600/ravnicapoints.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="341" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kw0fBjSarQQ/UE4iFz6D0SI/AAAAAAAACcY/MBqAXxsOsNQ/s400/ravnicapoints.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">with bonus mismatched guild colors, aaahhh</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It's cute and interesting how the top four guilds (red/blue Izzet, white/blue Azorious, blue/black Dimir, and blue/green Simic) all have blue. Assuming that the majority of people joined guilds thinking, <i>Yes, this guild personifies me,</i>&nbsp;does this mean that Magic players tend towards self-identifying as blue, which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering#Colors_of_Magic">Wikipedia</a> reminds me is "the color of intellect, reason, illusion, logic, knowledge, manipulation, and trickery"? I guess it makes sense -- I mean, you'd imagine that a strategic trading card game would draw in people really into logic/knowledge/manipulation/trickery/etc.<br /><br />If the most popular guilds are the ones that Magic players might see their own characteristics in, then what are the characteristics that players <i>don't</i>&nbsp;identify with, the ones of the least popular guilds? (Where "popularity" means not just joining the guild, but adoring it enough to complete arbitrary online activities for it?)<br /><br />Third from last, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/orzhov">Orzhov</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The Orzhov guild is founded on the beliefs that <b>wealth is power</b>, that structure breeds wealth, and that guilt creates structure. The guild is run like a combination <b>religion, credit-lending agency, and crime syndicate</b>. [...] Most Ravnicans see the Orzhov for the <b>corrupt organization</b> they are, but many are lured in by their promises of wealth, prestige, and longevity.</i></blockquote><br />Second from last, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/rakdos">Rakdos</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The Rakdos Cult is a large group of hedonists, <b>sadists, criminals, and psychopaths</b>...&nbsp;[...]The Rakdos Cult combines an instinctual bloodlust and desire for power. They’re sadistic and cruel simply for the fun of it. <b>Opportunistic violence</b> is their modus operandi. Mayhem and personal enjoyment is their goal...</i></blockquote><br />And finally, the Very Last, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/gruul">Gruul</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The Gruul are a loose affiliation of <b>savage clans who squat in Ravnica’s alleyways</b>, abandoned zones, and overgrown ruins. [...] Warfare among the Gruul is constant and almost ritualistic; the Gruul believe that <b>only the strong should survive and rule</b>. The Gruul are the most <b>anti-civilization</b> and <b>disenfranchised</b> of all of Ravnica’s guilds, and as such are the most ill at ease in a world covered by city.</i></blockquote><br />I guess it's nice that the guilds that are flat-out described as being filled with sadists and criminals are the least popular? And maybe the unpopularity of Orzhov is a sort of Occupy Ravnica thing? It's a little saddening to me that Gruul is the least popular, though. Out of the three of last-placers, it's the one that doesn't outright use negative words like "corrupt" or "violence;" on the whole, Gruul seems to embody poverty ("squat in Ravnica's alleyways;" "disenfranchised") and "savageness," which historically is used to point at people and say, "You don't know the same things I know and deem important; therefore, you are unintelligent and backward (and I'm never going to join your guild)!"<br /><br />Then again, it could just be a flavor thing; out of all the guilds, even to me Gruul seems unimaginative, compared to, say, <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/izzet">Izzet</a>, which was intended to "provide solutions for public works projects (sewers, boilers, roadways), but...often produce mana geysers, spatial rifts, or arcane portals instead."<br /><br />Anyway~ After taking the quiz myself, I ended up as <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/selesnya">Selesnya</a>. After taking the quiz a second time, I ended up <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/simic">Simic</a>. Since both are sort of nature-y and less manifest destiny then the other guilds, I have to say neither of these results were unexpected. The flavor pages for both guilds also feature mostly women characters, which is pretty cool. Selesnya even has <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/images/guildquiz/guildpage/GuildImage_Selesnya_03.jpg">a non-white-looking humanoid creature</a>! (I'm still waiting for a non-white human creature; apparently, despite being denizens of <i>an entire planet</i>&nbsp;converted into a city, all humans are white. Shrug. Sigh.)</div>

In her sleeping cabinet behind the rubble of an old barbershop where she lives with her grandfather, she thinks about what is lost-how the world went from amusement parks, movie theaters, birthday parties, fathers and mothers . . . to ash and dust, scars, permanent burns, and fused, damaged bodies. And now, at an age when everyone is required to turn themselves over to the militia to either be trained as a soldier or, if they are too damaged and weak, to be used as live targets, Pressia can no longer pretend to be small. Pressia is on the run.<br /><br />Burn a Pure and Breathe the Ash . . . <br />There are those who escaped the apocalypse unmarked. Pures. They are tucked safely inside the Dome that protects their healthy, superior bodies. Yet Partridge, whose father is one of the most influential men in the Dome, feels isolated and lonely. Different. He thinks about loss-maybe just because his family is broken; his father is emotionally distant; his brother killed himself; and his mother never made it inside their shelter. Or maybe it's his claustrophobia: his feeling that this Dome has become a swaddling of intensely rigid order. So when a slipped phrase suggests his mother might still be alive, Partridge risks his life to leave the Dome to find her. <br /><br />When Pressia meets Partridge, their worlds shatter all over again.</i></blockquote><br />(spoilers ahead)<br /><br />I finished <i>Pure</i>&nbsp;yesterday and I feel fairly mixed about it. The world itself is immensely intriguing, comprised of a vast wasteland and a "Dome." The wastelands are populated with people who, after the "Detonations," found themselves fused to objects, animals, even other people around them. One of the main characters, Pressia, wanders a market filled with emaciated citizens whose flesh is part-glass; she flees the "Dusts," stone-fleshed people who were pressed into buildings; there are even "Groupies," people fused to other people, who seem notorious for drunken-ness and trouble-making.<br /><br />Though at some times I could see it being considered sparse, I adored the to-the-point description.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The droning was some kind of air mission, and we wondered if there would be more bombs. But what would be the point? Everything was done, obliterated or swept up by the fires; there were dark puddles from black rain. Some drank the water and died from it. Our scars were fresh, our wounds and warpings raw. The survivors hobbled and limped, a procession of death, hoping to find a place that had been spared. We gave up. We were slack. We didn't take cover. Maybe some were hoping it was a relief effort. Maybe I was too.</i></blockquote><br />Description coming from the characters' mouths, however, felt heavy and extraneous at times.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>"Did you ever wonder why we're not experiencing a full nuclear winter? Well, because it was orchestrated to avoid one. They used a cocktail of bombs -- the Low Orbiting Focused Enhanced Radiation Neutron System satellites known as LoFERNS, and the High Orbiting Focused Enhanced Radiation Neutron System satellites, or HiFERNS, with electromagnetic pulse -- EMP -- magnification."<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />"And how did Dusts come about? The bombs disrupted molecular structures. The cocktails included the distribution of nanotechnology to help speed up the recovery of the earth -- nanotechnology that promotes the self-assembly of molecules. The nanotechnology, speeded up by DNA, which is an informational material but also excellent at the self-assembly of cells, made our fusing stronger. And the nanotechnology that hit the humans trapped in rubble or scorced land helped them to regenerate. Even though they couldn't completely free themselves, the human cells of the Dusts grew powerful and learned to survive."</i></blockquote><br />I guess this all <i>might</i> be okay because the person speaking is characteristically pedantic? And is at the moment relaying "conspiracy theories" to a rebel audience? In the end, I suppose it's my personal preference that details this specific about fake technology glossed over and left to stand real in their ambiguity.<br /><br />Characters also tend to realize things abruptly and completely believe in those realizations, or else remember something suddenly, pose it as a possible explanation for whatever is happening, and pages later accept it as fact.<br /><br />This book often references Japan due to the connection between "Detonations" and the effects of atomic bombs during World War II. I felt a little uncomfortable about Japan's relation to the story, though, in ways that it's difficult for me to describe. Pressia, who knows she's half-Japanese (despite not knowing what "Japan" is), is described twice as having almond-shaped eyes, which feeds my personal pet peeve of non-white features described with food items (i.e. "caramel" or "chocolate" skin) -- in some sense it serves as a reminder that everyone else in the book is European-descended (except, maybe, the character whose name is "El Capitan").<br /><br />Later, another character theorizes,<br /><br /><blockquote><i>"Here's my take. The man your mother had a child with, he was in one everything that the Japanese were doing -- or trying to undo. Radiation resistance. Your mother fed him information. I agree with your mother's decision there. <b>Some of the Japanese were really the good guys, if you ask me</b> [...]</i>"</blockquote><br />I don't understand this part. If "some of the Japanese were really the good guys," it kind of sounds like the majority of them are not? Or that it's accepted knowledge that the majority of them were not? And what does "bad guys" mean in this scenario? I can't imagine why anyone would think of radiation resistance scientists as "bad guys," much less the civilian population affected by the bomb. By the end of the book, "Japan" ends up being nothing more than exotic wallpaper: almond-shaped eyes, shiny black hair, "even-toned skin" (what does this even mean and why is it ascribed to Pressia's Japanese blood), a flashback of flowering branches, some random Japanese writing, and "some good guys."<br /><br />One last thing that made me wince -- this conversation, between a "Pure" person, Partridge, and Bradwell, who lived through the Detonations and was disfigured by them:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>"Jesus!" [Bradwell] says, hit by a sudden flare of anger. "What's it like to walk around perfect, huh, Partridge? No scars, no burns, no birds. To be a clean slate?"</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>The question makes Partridge angry. "Just because I live in a Dome doesn't mean I've never suffered. I mean, it's not like your suffering. What could compare to this, huh? Do you want an award for it? A medal that says First Place Suffering? You win, Bradwell. Okay? You win."</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>[Partridge describes the death of his brother]</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Bradwell pauses a moment. "I'm sorry about that." It feels like an apology for a lot of things, actually, like thinking Partridge's life was a cakewalk.</i></blockquote><br />This exchange was sigh-inducing to me because:<br /><br /><ol><li>Partridge is a character from a position of power that he <i>literally</i>&nbsp;has because his father orchestrated the bombing of all these people -- who then demands from one of those people, "What about <i>my</i>&nbsp;problems?!"</li><li>Even if Partridge's life was not 100% pure utter euphoria, his quality of life within the Dome (with edible food, education, general health) really just&nbsp;<i>can't</i>&nbsp;be compared to Bradwell's life, in which most days are described as a struggle, where everyone has been hurt by an elite few for the sake of the elite. </li><li>Even so, I guess it's okay that characters from different backgrounds exchange sympathies? But in the end, Bradwell still feels like the bad guy -- he sympathizes with Partridge, and Partridge doesn't bother sympathizing with Bradwell at all.</li></ol><div>It's just...sigh-inducing.</div><div><br /></div><div>There were a couple moments in the book where I was like, "Whoa, do you feel that? I just had the STRONGEST EMOTION," so that was nice. I'm also curious to see how Fox 2000, who apparently has the film rights to this book, will depict a world in which the majority of people are visibly not "Pure."</div></div>
