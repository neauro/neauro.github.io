(What is it like to love someone and then see their body thrown into the back of a garbage truck? <em>Oh God</em>)<br /><br />It’s a story that I would be surprised to find in the US, because despite the fact that the title alludes to the wolf-shapeshifting children, the story is just as much about their mother, Hana, and her struggles to raise the children, aided only by her dead partner’s dwindling savings. She learns about natural birth to avoid going to hospitals; she fights off health inspectors; at some point her daughter accidentally ingests detergent and there’s an amusing scene of her rushing off into the night and then glancing desperately back and forth between a children’s hospital and a pet clinic.<br /><br />Though Hana misses her partner, at no point does she ever really find a replacement for him, or need another man at all. Even when she moves into the countryside, she receives assistance from the entire community there (though there is vaguely tsundere old man involved). Though her partner was a wolfman and is the reason why her children are also partially wolves, he just isn’t a part of the equation after he leaves. It sounds simple, but it’s such a relief that there are stories out there about women persevering, doing their own thing against all odds, and ultimately finding a place where they (and their children) can just be themselves.<br /><br />It’s also just a relief to see a woman who isn’t vilified for being a single mother, who isn’t ultimately viewed as lesser and unwhole for her lack of a man, who loses him and continues to move on with her life. Despite what much media would have you believe, without men, women keep existing and struggling towards their own goals.<br /><br />It&#8217;s true that Hana’s motivations center almost entirely on the health of her children, which on its own isn’t terribly stereotype-breaking, but I appreciated how Hana didn’t lose her personality to become a faceless machine of a mother figure, a character wholly defined by her offspring’s emotions. Her bright attitude could have been unbelievable, but was acceptable to me because it is something established as a defining trait: &#8220;Even at my father’s funeral I laughed.&#8221; And even so, it doesn’t mean she’s perfect: she often admits her ignorance (and remedies it thoroughly researching all her problems), she cries, she bandages her fingers, she panics, and rubs her back when it aches. You also get a glimpse of Hana&#8217;s life as it was before motherhood, and a little &#8220;after,&#8221; once her children have embarked <br /><br />And now that all of that is said — though <em>Wolf Children</em> impressed me with its focus on Hana as a single mother, after talking about this movie with Heather, I learned that the &#8220;virtuous mother&#8221; is actually a trope not uncommon in Eastern narratives. I haven&#8217;t noticed it much, but will definitely be keeping an eye on it from now on.</div>

I enjoyed it I guess. I play so few first-person shooters that I might as well go for the newest, most-polished one if I’m going to play anything while waiting (wistfully) for the next Metroid Prime. I have a penchant for headshots that seems to surprise people, but it is faster and cleaner and ultimately less squicky than melee in this game, which consists of scooping flesh from the faces of your opponents with a rotating hook-thingy. I saw the pink-red eye sockets of my first victim and felt ill and decided to go guns from then on, despite my usual powerful desire to greedily hoard any item I acquire in a game, including ammo.<br /><br /><br /><h2>2.</h2>The racism was also squicky. People seem to be very happy to engage in racism when it’s not real life, and defend its use as an edgy plot device. Ultimately I&#8217;m just exhausted by it, exhausted by black people apologizing to you over sudsy puddles, exhausted by Chinese people shouting for mercy in pidgin English before being disemboweled. I’m exhausted by the obsession of recreating racist worlds.<br /><br />In <i>Bioshock Infinite</i> you play as Booker Dewitt, and Booker doesn’t really care about racism one way or another. Oh, no, wait — I once ran into a black person who apologized for smoking in the back of a building, and Booker said something like, &#8220;Do what you want, I don’t care.&#8221; That&#8217;s Booker for you: except in combat, and except for the couple of times when he shouts after his sidekick, Elizabeth, Booker is cool as a cucumber. The setting of Columbia — the racism, the religion — slides off him like water off a duck&#8217;s back.<br /><br /><br /><h2>3.</h2>Columbia (and its racism?) seems to be the system installed by its founder, a man named Comstock. Comstock later turns out to be you, which made something twist around in my stomach. <em>What?</em> How could Booker be Comstock? What in this story ever alluded to the idea that Booker could ever turn out to be Comstock? Booker is like a duck that’s been floating around in an indoor swimming pool, suddenly being told that with one little nudge he could have been the creator of that indoor swimming pool. Okay, not the best analogy, but look at him! He&#8217;s a <em>duck</em>! How could he have gone from not caring about a black guy smoking in the back of a building, to someone who likens black people to dogs and says they should be thankful for the food and shelter given to them by their slavers?<br /><br /><br /><h2>4.</h2>There&#8217;s really something to be said about how completely wonderful it feels when your brain finds patterns. I screamed with happiness when we ended up in Rapture again. I grabbed Andou&#8217;s shoulder when Elizabeth looked over and said, &#8220;There&#8217;s always a man, a city, and a lighthouse.&#8221; My brain was like, <em>Hey, I know that! I thought that that beginning was all just homage, but it was on purpose! There&#8217;s always a lighthouse!</em><br /><br />So that&#8217;s what I wish I could pull in from an alternate dimension of game development: that Booker could have hesitated over racism — that he had had a chance to show that he could have been power-hungry, or obsessed with redemption, or obsessed with power enough to show how a the slightest nudge could have made him a Comstock monster. It would have been nice to see Booker reject his baptism and, when Elizabeth said there existed an alternate universe in which Booker accepted, to realize exactly what that meant. <br /><br /><br /><h2>5.</h2>Here was another fun part of the game&#8217;s story: the first mention of quantum physics. Both Andou and I leaped and began to freak out. Oh my gosh, quantum physics. Quantum mechanics. Schrödinger&#8217;s Cat. Is Columbia an epic experiment? Are we alive and dead?<br /><br />That paradox was so delicious that in some ways I wish that it had been everything, that somehow the setting could have abandoned its blaring, boring, meaningless racism and instead mused and ruminated on the significance or futility of our choices, and the consequences and not-consequences that bloom simultaneously after each. (Spare or kill? Bird or cage?)<br /><br />Booker already seems like a character set up perfectly for the agony of decision and regret: he kills Native Americans at Wounded Knee and seems to spiral downward from there, attempting (in one timeline) Christianity to clean away his presumed guilt. His room is cluttered with evidence of gambling, drinking. <em>Get the girl</em>, the game chants, <em>and wipe away the debt</em> — and imagine if Anna was some orphan he attempted to save, if she was a symbol of him trying desperately to do something good in his life, even if it meant the massacre of Columbia&#8217;s peons.<br /><br /><br /><h2>6.</h2>Heck, the racism would have been way more interesting if it had been flavored with Booker&#8217;s hypothetical thirst for forgiveness. Maybe the Booker that gets baptized can&#8217;t deal with his being a murderer, and redefines people of color to be less than human to cope. Baptized Booker can&#8217;t wait for his death to redeem him, so he takes heaven into his own hands, and decides who is saved and who is Sodom.<br /><br />As for the Booker that doesn&#8217;t get baptized, maybe he encounters Anna on the way home, and uses her as his redemption instead. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care how many people die,&#8221; Booker could snarl at one point, &#8220;if it means that you are safe,&#8221; if it means that his debts can be wiped away. Who are these Columbians anyway? Cult freaks — less than human.<br /><br />Ultimately both Bookers end up throwing away others for their own &#8220;Good.&#8221; So how important was that baptism, in the end? How malleable is fate, after all is said and done?<br /><br /><br /><h2>7.</h2>There has to be room for Daisy Fitzeroy in this alternate dimension wish-fulfillment narrative as well, because I loved her before she was revealed to be an empty cliche of an Angry Black Woman. Maybe she could represent what it takes to forgive people who have transgressed against you, or what it takes to even decide whether or not people deserve to be forgiven.<br /><br />&#8220;Even you can be good again, Booker,&#8221; Daisy might say if you made the right conversation choices. &#8220;Find forgiveness serving others.&#8221; They can glance over at Elizabeth pointedly.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll have my debts forgiven, alright,&#8221; Booker might mutter, still gruff.<br /><br /><br /><h2>8.</h2>All this forgiveness stuff could totally make Elizabeth&#8217;s final standoff with her &#8220;mother&#8221; more impactful too. Maybe it could even tie in with Elizabeth&#8217;s recurring issues with her supposed parents, her fury with them, how they &#8220;should&#8221; have been. How do Comstock and Booker try to protect her? How do their hopes and dreams live on through her, even when they die? Get it? Alive and dead at the same time? Eh? Ehhhh?<br /><br /><br /><h2>9.</h2>Yeah. A nugget of forgiveness would have been sick.</div>

But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves&#8211;and herself&#8211;while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.<br /><br />Tris&#8217;s initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable&#8211;and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.</blockquote><br />[spoilers ahead]<br /><br />Insurgent was okay. Like Divergent, it was full of action; unlike it, the action felt unfocused. Reading it was like going through an amusement park ride with great plastic things hissing from around very dark corner: thrilling, and not much else.  Insurgent tours readers around the enclosed communities of Tris’s world, but in a limited fashion: it’s still unclear why there are so many trains around for characters to use as transportation (who is even driving them? What are they carrying normally?), and until the end of the book I had completely forgotten that all the factions are enclosed in a fence.<br /><br />There were so many characters that I felt did nothing but burden the story. Though I could remember their names and a couple defining character traits (Lynn, &#8220;the bitter one;&#8221; Uriah, &#8220;the teasing hottie&#8221;), none of these characters really <i>did</i>&nbsp;anything to advance Tris’s understanding of herself or the world around her. For example, when Uriah is discovered to be Divergent, capable of somehow defying the simulation serums, the only consequence is a couple people snubbing him, slightly. Tris doesn’t seem to care one way or the other, so why should we? Even if the point is that Tris doesn’t care, why is it important at all that Uriah is Divergent?<br /><br />Some of these characters did contribute to powerful moments — I’m thinking in particular of when Marlene was entranced in a simulation that made her step off a rooftop — but even then Tris’s motivations seem unclear (Why did she save Hector? Why did Lynn thank her for it, and then say later that she loved Marlene? Huh?) and therefore overly dramatic.<br /><br />Ultimately I’ll still give the third book a try out of curiosity, because they’re so short and because pure &#8220;thrills&#8221; can still be delicious sometimes.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I tried using <a href="http://lift.do/">Lift</a> for a while. Having read <a href="http://zenhabits.net/sticky/">ZenHabit</a>&#8217;s encouragement that the way to start a habit is by just <em>starting</em>, even if it&#8217;s a little bit at a time, I thought Lift would be a good (and pretty) way to keep myself accountable. I rearranged my iPod home screen, putting it on my front page&#8217;s top row. I dutifully added three habits that I wanted to keep track of: getting exercise, writing, and more writing.<br /><br />Two things broke Lift for me.<br /><br /><strong>First — You can&#8217;t go back to previous days to mark what habits you did, but didn&#8217;t mark that day.</strong> Or maybe you can, and I just couldn&#8217;t figure out how? In any case, I have an iPod — I&#8217;m not connected to the internet through it every day — and stressing myself out by making sure I log into Lift at least once a day is something I&#8217;m not willing or happy to burden my completionist personality with.<br /><br /><strong>Second — ultimately, Lift isn&#8217;t meaningful enough to me.</strong> Though I&#8217;m working on getting both exercise and writing time, actually doing those things is the feel-good reward, and Lift doesn&#8217;t add to these feelings in any interesting way. Even with Tiny Tower, logging in once a day to mindlessly tap things gives you, eventually, an impressive tower. All Lift could do for me was represent my taps as a series of colored bars and occasionally send some canned inspirational e-mails.<br /><br />On a side note, it is fun to read Lift&#8217;s blog and see data compiled about people&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.lift.do/post/40128965086/infographic-your-goals-in-2013">2013 goals</a>, or other ways that people are using <a href="http://blog.lift.do/post/42988396863/lift-tip-rewards-for-good-habits">extrinsic awards</a> to keep themselves sticking to habits that I think are easy to justify yourself out of, such as not staying late at work.</div>

Yeah! It does make me wonder about the life cycle of this sort of app though. It seems to make itself obsolete by the success of its users (assuming success is defined by gaining intrinsic happiness). Then again, I suppose you could say that about a lot of things (like dating sites :P).</div>

If you&#39;ve gotten started and now actually doing your habits is your reward, then I&#39;d say you probably don&#39;t need Lift at this point anyway. :)</div>

I&#8217;ve recently started using <a href="http://www.trello.com">Trello</a> to keep track of my myriad projects, and I love it because I can use it as an always-accessible repository of lists for ideas regarding games, writing, websites, homework, and so on. It&#8217;s also great for keeping track of resources like free icon sets. I&#8217;ve also been using it to manage and focus on what things are actually currently on my plate, and making sure I don&#8217;t overextend myself.<br /><br />My prime reading time has always been during my commutes, but I have been reading less because I&#8217;ve discovered <a href="">IA Writer</a>, a writing app which features a simple UI, a re-arranged keyboard, and integration with iCloud (which took me forever how to use; but it&#8217;s way more convenient than e-mailing myself everything). I absolutely adore it and have been using it for writing practice, which has in general alleviated my plaguing anxieties about not writing enough. I tried writing on the bus with my sketchbook but the bus&#8217;s movement made my scribbles illegible; typing on my iPod makes things easier, and even a little fun.<br /><br />I have also been hard at work on my part of this year&#8217;s group cosplay, Black Rock Shooter. I was initially going to go for Demon Cannon User, but then a friend dropped out due to busy-ness, and now I&#8217;m rocking Strength, for which I am actually attempting to build up strength to carry around the huge cardboard hands that Andou is helping me make.<br /><br />Winter quarter is also in full swing. This quarter I&#8217;m taking my first &#8220;practical&#8221; class, usability testing, and it&#8217;s funny — I always thought that I would find practical classes more immediately applicable — but instead I&#8217;m finding myself missing theory courses, where you could learn a theory and apply it <em>immediately</em>, instead of waiting to gather participants and test. I&#8217;m working with a group to improve and analyze the usability of <a href="http://www.mappingvoices.org">Mapping Voices</a>, which I was interested in for the potential application of game design — for example, how can you encourage people to take action against health inequity? How can you make people feel productive taking action?<br /><br />Though it looks like our suggestions will have to hold up against a bureaucracy and generally complicated organization, I&#8217;m looking forward to contributing to a local organization!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Right now I am totally in love with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julietta_Suzuki">Suzuki Julietta</a>. She is the manga-ka of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamisama_Kiss"><em>Kamisama Hajimemashita</em></a>, which recently got propelled in my mind to 5-star status after it started acquiring a time paradox, a plot device to which I am particularly weak. (How could she have planned that?! <em>Hoowww</em>?)<br /><br />Suzuki has a great grasp of storytelling and character development, something that I really appreciate in shoujo manga. Recently I described <a href="http://www.mangahere.com/manga/kamisama_hajimemashita/c065/">Chapter 65</a> (and 66) to Andou as an example. It goes like this:<br /><br />Nanami is making talismans for the shrine, so that visitors can come and get charms for things like &#8220;traffic safety,&#8221; &#8220;love,&#8221; &#8220;prosperous business.&#8221; Tomoe sees them and goes, &#8220;Your handwriting is awful, let&#8217;s make new talismans on the nice wood that I stored away.&#8221; Nanami admits that she thought that wood was trash and threw it away and feels bad that she&#8217;s disappointed him and hasn&#8217;t made much headway in being a good god. Later that night, she notices Tomoe leaving and follows him mistakenly across some ethereal border and is almost smashed by a giant&#8217;s foot. Tomoe saves her, and they wander around the night market searching for new talisman wood. Eventually Nanami separates from Tomoe and discovers two demons bullying a child, and when she tries to intervene, the two demons go for her instead. Wracking her brain for solutions, she eventually leads them beyond the ethereal border, where they are promptly smashed. They sneer that she will get stomped on too, but Nanami smiles and opens her coat to reveal: a talisman for traffic safety.<br /><br />There&#8217;s just something <em>so delighful</em> about the story coming back full circle. In a sense you should have expected it — maybe you had the fun of figuring out yourself how Nanami could have made it out of her situation — even if you didn&#8217;t, your brain lights up to realize the importance of something so seemingly insignificant. The final talisman also serves to answer her insecurities about being a bad god (even if her handwriting is bad, it <em>works!</em>), and as a bonus, makes Nanami to me a little more &#8220;real&#8221; — more of a person who is reacting to things in her environment, learning about them, using them.<br /><br />It&#8217;s just <em>great</em>, and by no means an isolated formula. For example, in <a href="http://www.mangahere.com/manga/karakuri_odette/v01/c001/">the first chapter of Suzuki&#8217;s other work, Karakuri Odette</a>, Odette begins attending high school, much to the hesitation of the school administrators. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; says Odette&#8217;s creator, &#8220;if she ever runs into problems, she&#8217;ll emit a signal to me, and I&#8217;ll pick her up right away.&#8221; They agree and as Odette tries to learn more about what it means to be human, she asks her creator to make adjustments to her body: first, to add the ability to eat food, and second, to subtract from her robotic physical ability so she&#8217;s only as strong as an average 15-year-old. Odette finds a new friend who is sickly and occasionally has seizures, and wanders around with her to a construction site, where both Odette and the girl fall into a well. Since she asked to be weakened, Odette can no longer climb out on her own — but then the girl starts to breathe desperately and beg for medicine — so Odette says, &#8220;Look away, don&#8217;t look back until I say so,&#8221; and when the girl turns away <em>Odette removes her head from her body</em> — which triggers the signal, and makes her creator come running.<br /><br /><em>So good!</em> There&#8217;s just something utterly delicious of a small detail turning out to mean everything. This is something that I think is a challenge to do with games. When you pick up a key in level 1, for example, it&#8217;s hard to imagine that it could be used to anything other than a treasure chest. (Though, knowing that, it would be fun to purposefully subvert this and make the key into an instrument for something else.)<br /><br />I&#8217;ve never played A Link to the Past, but apparently there&#8217;s a great example of &#8220;small detail coming back to bite you&#8221; in it. It goes kind of like this: In one of the first towns you visit, there&#8217;s a man who describes a nearby building as the old home of some evil bandit who for some reason couldn&#8217;t stand the light. You play on, and on, and eventually, you return to the old home, and rescue the maiden in it, who begins to follow you around as you make your escape. At some point, you set a bomb off in a room, which collapses a ceiling and lets the light in — and when the maiden walks into it, she rips her skin off and become&#8217;s the bandit. <em>The bandit, the dungeon&#8217;s boss, has been following you this whole time! Whoa! Ahhh!</em><br /><br />Delicious.</div>

She’s a second-class citizen with a mysterious past, reviled by her stepmother and blamed for her stepsister’s illness. But when her life becomes intertwined with the handsome Prince Kai’s, she suddenly finds herself at the center of an intergalactic struggle, and a forbidden attraction. Caught between duty and freedom, loyalty and betrayal, she must uncover secrets about her past in order to protect her world’s future.</em></blockquote><br />I just finished reading <em>Cinder</em> by Marissa Meyer and absolutely loved it, and am still trying to figure out why. It came with recommendations from some friends and Tumblr, whose endorsement loosened my fear that a &#8220;New Beijing&#8221; setting would be filled with all manner of gross exotifications a la <a href="http://beyondvictoriana.com/2010/02/13/beyond-victoriana-14-the-wind-up-girl-guest-review-by-jaymee-goh/">other future Asia books</a>. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t!<br /><br />I wavered a little when the love interest, Prince <strike>Charming</strike> Kai was introduced; off the bat he is introduced as having &#8220;copper-colored&#8221; eyes and a plethora of shrieking fangirls (really). Though I still could have done without the fangirls, Prince Kai on his own was fine — more than a love interest with swoon-inducing eyes, a perfectly tortured too-young politician with bangs and occasional sad gazes and statements. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he says at some point, &#8220;I guess I really should give up my life for my people :&#8217;(&#8221;<br /><br />(Sometimes this is exactly what I want. This is one of those times.)<br /><br />Cinder herself is a great cyborg. She isn&#8217;t just furnished with metal parts, she <em>is</em> them. She notes when her software tells her people lying; she escapes embarrassing moments due to her inability to blush; her moments of panic are accompanied by suggestions that she take deep breaths to decrease heightened levels of adrenaline. If there&#8217;s anything else I wanted out of this story&#8217;s cyborgness, it&#8217;s more of a reason why cyborgs are hated; at some point her stepmother snaps that Cinder can&#8217;t really feel anything, can she, but this just doesn&#8217;t seem reason enough for a society-deep fear and disdain. Maybe if there had been some big incident that made everything cling to and guard their own humanity as something they cherished, &#8220;true&#8221; emotions and all? (Maybe if this incident was related to the Luna?)<br /><br />One of the story&#8217;s Big Twists is something easy to call from the first 50 pages. Though I was tempted to feel disdained, after reading <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2013/01/books-of-2012.html">Wired for Story</a> and its mantra that &#8220;reads love to find delight in figuring out what&#8217;s going on!&#8221; I&#8217;m giving it a second thought. After all, it <em>is</em> pretty fun to know the secret from the beginning — to see Cinder dodge it — to know what&#8217;s really going on.<br /><br />Another aspect of this story that&#8217;s pretty cool is the amount of <em>stuff</em> going on — Cinder&#8217;s tension with her family, Cinder&#8217;s mysterious past, Cinder&#8217;s being hated as a cyborg, the soon-to-be-emperor, the psychic aliens, the plague. For the most part, however, all of these things were all tied together and impact Cinder and the events in the story.<br /><br />Ultimately, <em>Cinder</em> was a fantastic story about a character who gets disadvantaged and broken up again and again and continues to persevere and stick to her principles.<br /><br />[ spoilers ]<br /><br />That being said, I do wish that the Big Twist — that Cinder is Princess <strike>Serena</strike> Selene of the moon — had been played with a little more. For example, the character Dr. Erland clearly knows Cinder&#8217;s secret, and persists in lying to her about it, and this serves as a shallow obstacle, since there&#8217;s nothing about Dr. Erland that makes you suspect him or his motives. So he&#8217;s lying to Cinder — so what? It isn&#8217;t affecting anything, she isn&#8217;t going to be hurt by it. Imagine instead of Dr. Erland were more sinister — if you knew he knew Cinder&#8217;s identity, and if every time Cinder entered the room with him you were crying for her to just get out of there before something awful happened — that would have been <i>great</i>.</div>

Last year was pretty great, in terms of learning more about what sort of things I&#8217;m capable of, and navigating the bewildering world of (un)employment and health insurance. In 2012, I finally started earning a salary, health insurance, and a 401k at my &#8220;dream job,&#8221; and two months later was laid off —freed, so to speak, from my decade-long devotion to being a game designer. To be honest, the fact that I will never spend my life thinking <em>What if I had just pursued my dream</em> is an odd gift that I never would have expected to receive and am very thankful for.<br /><br />(Which isn&#8217;t to say that I&#8217;ve given up on making games! Though, with all the other stuff that I want to do and learn about recently, I also can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m completely devoted to it anymore either.)<br /><br />Recently I&#8217;ve been trying to focus on making the most of every day, rather than thinking about how I can influence things way in the future, and for that reason I wasn&#8217;t too inspired to make a particular resolution for this year. However, I would like to try and get one draft of a looong story done this year, and now that I&#8217;ve settled into more a more permanent residence and have gotten into the swing of full-time employment and graduate school, I think that such a goal is more within reach :)<br /><br />My other obvious goal is to have a dog, but between the aforementioned work and school I think that will end up being a resolution for a later year!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BroUUBWsEMQ/UOnuq0fFp-I/AAAAAAAAC_g/V25GuYgJeLM/s1600/5994955277_d230103497.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BroUUBWsEMQ/UOnuq0fFp-I/AAAAAAAAC_g/V25GuYgJeLM/s1600/5994955277_d230103497.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">soon, my sweet</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

I finished total of 114 books last year. That significantly beats my running average of 15 books per year since 2008 (though I admit I haven&#8217;t been as avid a user of Goodreads before this year). Before anyone starts getting intimidated, this total is comprised of books of a variety of lengths and content, including: young adult fiction; super grown-up adult fiction; delicious non-fiction probably about the history and political atmosphere surrounding a specific food item; graphic novels and comic books; albums of photography; at least half a dozen light novels; and one James and the Giant Peach.<br /><br />I owe it all to two things:<br /><br /><ol><li>Less school — who knew that only taking evening classes would leave you with so much free time?</li><li>So much commuting — a.k.a. two hours of dedicated reading time every day.</li></ol><br />And so, without further ado:<br /><br /><br /><h2>Memorable Books of 2012</h2><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most Life-Changing</span></h2><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GIPY7HZZT38/UOnwPPIcYbI/AAAAAAAADAw/WjpZWNa_hsY/s1600/Untitled-2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GIPY7HZZT38/UOnwPPIcYbI/AAAAAAAADAw/WjpZWNa_hsY/s1600/Untitled-2.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Wired for Story, </i>Lisa Cron &amp; <i>Reading Like a Writer</i>, Francine Prose<br />(source: Goodreads)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Among all of the non-fiction that I read this year, these two books together were personally the most &#8220;life-changing&#8221; ones, because before I even finished either of them I felt my entire outlook on reading, writing, and story completely changed. <i>Wired on Story</i>&nbsp;focuses on scientific concepts and general &#8220;story architecture,&#8221; whereas <i>Reading Like a Writer</i>&nbsp;hones in on recognizing and interpreting writing on the &#8220;micro&#8221; scale, and on holding each word to the light to see its color.

They were all fine and didn&#8217;t quite have the visual appeal or charm of the anime, but I&#8217;m singling out the most recent volume because of its completely unexpected <i>what the fuck </i>factor, which involves (spoilers) cloning the &#8220;human soul&#8221; part of babies&#8217; brains, and placing them into a virtual environment to see how they &#8220;grow up.&#8221; Researchers monitor decades and generations of these isolated, disembodied humans in ease, as every year in the virtual environment lasts only a minute in the real world (or something like that). At some point one of the researchers experiments with cloning his own brain into a computer, and when they turn on the speakers, they hear the researcher&#8217;s voice, aghast and desperate: <i>&#8220;What do you mean, </i>I&#8217;m <i>the clone?

It&#8217;s a book that I think everyone should read if they&#8217;ve ever had to put themselves through high school US history courses. It discusses not just the whitewashing of history, but the strange and problematic air of idolization held for history figures like President Woodrow Wilson, and the politics of textbooks with regards to concepts like classism. It also has a ton of interesting stories about historical people of color. (For example, did you know that there was a Native American named Squanto who was captured by Englishmen, then somehow avoided slavery and made his way to London, then tried to make it back to North America and ended up back in England again, and then finally returned to North America some years later? Whoa!)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most &#8220;Wow, That was Really Good, I Really Wish There was More&#8221;</span></h2><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wNsccR0TXB4/UMzz7Doi4TI/AAAAAAAAC5I/yggPciSAIhw/s1600/9833.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wNsccR0TXB4/UMzz7Doi4TI/AAAAAAAAC5I/yggPciSAIhw/s320/9833.jpg" width="216" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9833.Blind_Willow_Sleeping_Woman">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><div><a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/12/blind-willow-sleeping-woman-haruki.html">As aforementioned</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most &#8220;Wow, I Can&#8217;t Believe I Enjoyed That&#8221;</span></h2><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aitXdecmZAY/UOn6DntXkTI/AAAAAAAADF4/zKLGk1Uw4ds/s1600/East+of+Eden.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aitXdecmZAY/UOn6DntXkTI/AAAAAAAADF4/zKLGk1Uw4ds/s320/East+of+Eden.jpg" width="212" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>East of Eden, </i>John Steinbeck</td></tr></tbody></table><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">It was really only surprising because I have such a tough time enjoying &#8220;classic&#8221; literature, but I found myself mesmerized by <i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;and even stole it from Andou to read desperately while we were waiting to board vacation flights.
