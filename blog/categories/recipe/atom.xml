("Real" being my way of distinguishing this sorbet from my actual first sorbet-making experience, in which I fastidiously measured out a cup of pineapple juice into a sorbet mixture, and then poured into the ice cream maker not this mixture, but the leftover pineapple juice. Whoops.)<br /><br />I really adore ice cream and gave an ice cream maker to my mother last Christmas, which she gave back to me after admitting she'd probably never use it. Molly Moon's book -- with its color, environmentally friendly morals, and cheering that you can really do it, it's easy! -- is what really got me interested in trying to make ice cream. But, since it was on hold at the library, I found a different book to use for initial experiments.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OyXLb-jT3RU/ULg8XgnBOOI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/P9IThybKY2E/s1600/recipe-week-ice-cream-52-easy-recipes-for-sally-sampson-paperback-cover-art.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OyXLb-jT3RU/ULg8XgnBOOI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/P9IThybKY2E/s1600/recipe-week-ice-cream-52-easy-recipes-for-sally-sampson-paperback-cover-art.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this one!

This is my source for the sorbet above, which is really just coconut milk, pineapple juice, and orange juice, with a little bit of cinnamon on top because it seemed like it needed something for the photo.<br /><br />I didn't realize making ice cream was so easy. The ice cream maker, a contraption I always regarded as impermeably mysterious for some reason, is in fact just a sort of canister with frozen stuff in it, in which you're supposed to whip up your mixture such that it freezes along the sides and gets filled with air in the process. Most ice cream recipes seem like some variation of "Put cream and other things into a saucepan, bring it to a simmer, let it cool, then throw it in an ice cream maker."<br /><br />Here's to a cool future.</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6uhzfNkxVpA/UDJowEbNE1I/AAAAAAAACRE/Lzzro_g4iDs/s1600/DSC_0001_08172012.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6uhzfNkxVpA/UDJowEbNE1I/AAAAAAAACRE/Lzzro_g4iDs/s640/DSC_0001_08172012.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />The other day HC came over and we decided to make cupcakes. Given my limited store of ingredients, we went with cheesecake, that being the type of cupcake that requires little investment in terms of icing and ingredients that I didn't posses.<br /><br />The recipe is sourced from what I now realize is <a href="http://www.kraftrecipes.com/recipes/paula-deens-easy-cheesecake-120241.aspx">Kraft's Recipes</a>. We changed the butter extract to vanilla extract. The recipe is for 12 cupcakes, but we ended up making around 18. Also, we ended up not putting any jam or anything on the cupcakes, but they were quite sweet on their own.<br /><br /><b>Ingredients</b><br /><ol><li>2 pkg. (8 oz. each) cream cheese, softened</li><li>1 cup granulated sugar</li><li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li><li>2 &nbsp;eggs</li><li>12 vanilla wafers</li><li>1 cup seedless raspberry jam</li><li>1pt. fresh raspberries</li><li>2 tbsp. powdered sugar for dusting</li></ol><div><br /></div><div><b>Instructions</b></div><div><div><ol><li>Place a paper cupcake liner in each of 18 muffin cups.</li><li>Beat cream cheese until fluffy. Add granulated sugar and butter extract, beating well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li><li>Place a vanilla wafer, flat-side down, in each muffin cup. Spoon cream cheese mixture over wafers, until paper lining is about 3/4ths filled. Bake for 20 minutes.</li><li>Allow tarts to cool completely. When cool, top each cheesecake cupcake with 1/2 Tbsp. of raspberry jam and fresh raspberries. Dust with powdered sugar.</li></ol><br />Since the vanilla wafers we bought were a little too small for the paper liner, we experimented with making half the liners filled with whole wafers, and half with crushed. (By the way -- vanilla wafers are easily crushed by placing them inside a glass mixing bowl, and mashing them with the flat bottom of another glass.)</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Unu9_hZ3afA/UDJpVbnjmSI/AAAAAAAACRQ/6U1WFs44JZ8/s1600/DSC_0002%2B%25282%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Unu9_hZ3afA/UDJpVbnjmSI/AAAAAAAACRQ/6U1WFs44JZ8/s640/DSC_0002%2B%25282%2529.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />In the end, the crushed wafers ended up quite crumbly, so whole wafers really are probably the way to go.</div></div>

Real Talk: This is the only thing I cooked for myself all summer.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7GIhwYehhS8/TmQ2ci9SAvI/AAAAAAAAAaU/pNSCc61AZNY/s1600/DSC_0004.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7GIhwYehhS8/TmQ2ci9SAvI/AAAAAAAAAaU/pNSCc61AZNY/s640/DSC_0004.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dat ingredients</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br /></h3><h3>   Ingredients</h3><ul><li>1 Russet Potato</li><li>2 broccoli florets</li><li>4 white mushrooms</li><li>some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarlsberg_cheese">Jarlsberg cheese</a></li><li>pinches of rosemary, ground seasalt</li></ul><i>Serves 1</i> (though to be honest, I'm always overly full when I finish, so you could probably split it)<br /><br /><br /><h3>   Instructions</h3><ol><li><strong>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</strong></li><li><strong>Wash the potato, stab it all around with a fork, and then stick it in the oven.</strong> If you do not stab your potato with a fork or knife, it will explode.</li><li><strong>Wash everything and then begin cutting it up.</strong> Mushrooms I tend to mince, and for broccoli I tear up the florets by hand.  I don't usually like the stem (despite it actually being sweeter than the florets), but it's easier for me to eat if I cut it up into small pieces.  Might as well use all the pounds you paid for, right?  <em>Fun Fact</em>: I can't find evidence of this now, but my old cooking teacher told me that it's better to tear broccoli rather than cut it.  <em>Fun Fact #2:</em> We're not using it here, but this reminds me that I read garlic yields more of its nutrients to you if you mince it than if you leave it in chunks.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NyHRsjf7lK8/TmRDSVyzoZI/AAAAAAAAAac/W3g6kW8Idtg/s1600/DSC_0011.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NyHRsjf7lK8/TmRDSVyzoZI/AAAAAAAAAac/W3g6kW8Idtg/s640/DSC_0011.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i always really liked the cross-sections of mushrooms and broccoli stems</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li><strong>Once the potato has been in for around 30 minutes, throw the broccoli into a pot of water and start bringing it to a boil.</strong> Once it starts boiling, turn the heat down low or turn it off completely and let it drain in a colander.  This is to prevent the broccoli from becoming over-cooked and leaking all its nutrients into the water besides.  (It's probably better to steam it, but I don't have a steamer and am always too lazy to look up hacky ways to steam.) The florets can hold a lot of water, so make sure you press out all the moisture either now or as you're eating so that stuff doesn't get soggy.</li><li><strong>Around this time, I also start frying the mushrooms.</strong> Specifically, I do it with Trader Joe's Spanish Olive Oil, and sprinkle on rosemary and freshly ground seasalt.  Why freshly ground seasalt?  Because when I searched the cabinets of the place I'm subletting, all I could find was a canister of large seasalt grains and a porcelain mortar and pestle.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1OOtVvICJ0k/TmRDeL7IcuI/AAAAAAAAAak/JCfADhKtSGQ/s1600/DSC_0013.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1OOtVvICJ0k/TmRDeL7IcuI/AAAAAAAAAak/JCfADhKtSGQ/s640/DSC_0013.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i wonder if it really makes the salt taste better</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li><strong>Once the mushrooms start looking pretty cooked, turn down the heat.</strong> It'll depend on you how cooked you want the mushrooms to be, though I generally like them pretty brown myself.  I wouldn't be frying them for more than 10 minutes or so.</li><li><strong>Once the potato has been in the oven for an hour and a half to two hours, take it out.</strong> I generally err on the side of waiting longer for the potato, since I love it when they're soft and mushy on the inside.  Plus this makes the skin crispier!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4mp2iXyqTUQ/TmRDmSqMVwI/AAAAAAAAAas/fzKhIbIkjVg/s1600/DSC_0014.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4mp2iXyqTUQ/TmRDmSqMVwI/AAAAAAAAAas/fzKhIbIkjVg/s640/DSC_0014.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">an armor of crunchy deliciousness</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ol><br /><br /><h3>   How to Eat</h3>I generally slice the potato in half, put in liberal amounts of minced Jarlsberg, and then hold the potato closed so that it will all melt into gooey deliciousness.  Then, eat with the mushrooms and broccoli in whatever proportions you desire. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f2IrirrJ0Sc/TmRIoWdiXTI/AAAAAAAAAa4/KDNnnbwFibM/s1600/DSC_0015.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f2IrirrJ0Sc/TmRIoWdiXTI/AAAAAAAAAa4/KDNnnbwFibM/s640/DSC_0015.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">mmmmmmmmm</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><h3>   Cost</h3>Laziness always brings me to the closest grocery for ingredients, which happens to be Whole Foods.  This is how much I spent at my last visit today: <br /><ul><li>White mushrooms, 0.40 lb at 3.99/lb -- $1.60</li><li>Broccoli crowns, 1.02 lb at 2.99/lb -- $3.06</li><li>Russet potato, 1.46 lb at 1.99/lb -- $2.91</li><li>Jarlsberg -- $4.00</li><li><strong>Total: ~$11.57</strong></li></ul><br />Everything was organic and thus more expensive, but this sort of stuff always makes me aware that "eating healthy" can really be a class issue.  I'm not saying that this is the healthiest meal on the planet, but it's probably better than a McDonalds dinner, with a trade-off that it's more expensive money-wise and time-wise.  I'm privileged in that I don't work so hard each day that it's difficult for me to find time to cook, much less find time to cook for myself <em>and</em> a family.  I mean, come on guys.  $8 for two potatoes, 5 mushrooms, and 3 broccoli crowns?</div>
