<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Last week I was convinced to join another tourney at The Dreaming, this time for constructed decks (i.e. decks that you make beforehand with love and high hopes, versus <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/bx-mz7fg7.html">drafted</a> decks).  I say &#8220;convinced&#8221; because I was not planning on participating but rather on sitting on the sidelines writing <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/2011-nanowrimo-limning.html">NaNo</a> and challenging people to friendlies, but then the store worker person came around and said that they were one person short for the &#8220;casual&#8221; tourney (which is a little more low-key than the &#8220;competitive&#8221; tourney, and everyone comes away with a prize of some sort), so I was like, Alright, fine, why not?<br /><br />(Later, I realized that in the first round of the casual tourney, Andou had gotten a by.  Which meant that they actually had the right amount of people for a tourney!  Wat!)<br /><br /><a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/silly-werewolf-deck-v2.html">Werewolf deck</a> was fun (as usual) but I ended up winning only one of my matches, against someone who purportedly threw his deck together for lols and was planning to dismantle it immediately after the tourney.<br /><br />Themes I noticed/learned:<br /><ul><li><strong>I was able to consistently pull off <em>super</em> strong openings</strong>, to the extent that people I was playing against would sigh and say &#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re going to win this one&#8221; before thoroughly putting me down some turns later.  Still, dat strong opening!  Turn 1 Reckless Waif, turn 2 transform and play Full Moon&#8217;s Rise and swing for 4.  <em>Go Waif go!</em></li><li><strong>One of the most stark problems I had was resisting creature spot removal</strong>, i.e. that one match where the guy kept using Arc Trail to pick off my werewolves and then hitting me and then putting out Stormblood Berserker, ugh.  Not to mention that he would usually be able to play multitudes of spells which could either prevent transformation or force it back to humans.</li><li><strong>You can target Illusions with Kessig Wolf Run to kill them!</strong>  That&#8217;s pretty useful.</li><li>Also useful (though not for me): cards like Ratchet Bomb, which can destroy things with 0 mana cost for free.  <strong>Apparently werewolves in transformed form technically have 0 mana cost</strong> and can therefore instantly die.  Blagh.</li></ul><br />In the end, all was well and good because I still got a foil <a href="http://magiccards.info/zen/en/170.html">Nissa Revane</a> (though it&#8217;s already rotated out of standard and can&#8217;t be played legally in formal tourneys anymore, I guess) and Andou (who won the entire tourney) opened up a foil Instigator Pack which I instantly begged for and received.  Werewolves &lt;3<br /><br />Afterward and over the weekend I played more and came up with more ideas about improving upon Werewolf Deck in general:<br /><br /><ul><li><strong>Birds of Paradise.</strong>  Why?  Because Turn 1 Forest and Birds.  Turn 2, Mountain, and tap all three lands for Daybreak Ranger.  Turn 3, some other land, then tap four for Instigator Gang.  Oh, what?  Your 0/1 Birds can now attack as a 1/1 (or 3/1, if Instigator is transformed)?!</li><li><strong>Spellskite.</strong>  You can use it to pay two life and have any spell or ability&#8217;s target changed to Spellskite, which is a 0/4 too meaty for a single shot with Incinerate, Shock, etc.  Plus it&#8217;s only a 2 drop, which means you can get a really good, cheap defender which can keep werewolves alive from all that sniping!  Cons: It&#8217;s popular in general and therefore about $10 a pop.  Bleh.</li><li><strong>Mask of Avacyn?</strong>  Pro: Also can prevent sniping of werewolves, and also gives extra defense, which wolves lack.  Con: It&#8217;s expensive (2 to summon, 3 to equip) and I haven&#8217;t yet used it successfully.</li><li><strong>Less Daybreaks and Kruins,</strong> i.e. maybe not a set of each in my deck, because I keep getting them in my opening hand an wishing I had either or instead.  Dang you, $1 MTG binder that had Daybreaks.  I was so excited to have as many as possible.</li><li><strong>Red Sun Zenith?</strong>  Because against decks that just fatten the heck up, it&#8217;s hard to find anything to kill large creatures.  Cons: It&#8217;s a sorcery, so, no transformation on the turn I might need it.</li></ul><br /><br />One of the better ways of thinking of ways to improve Werewolf Deck would probably be to find some award-winning werewolf deck online, but I kind of enjoy doing it on my own.</div>
