It swerves dangerously close to racist statements sometimes (&#8220;the French language&#8230;romantic and <em>spirituel</em> but also, of course, the paragon of logic and clarity;&#8221; sure, but have you really studied other languages, or is this whole book going to be European-centric?), but the tone is pretty subjective and the discussion (at least for now) goes deeper than pure labeling.  <span class="shh">And at some point he mentioned Tagalog, which made me really happy :D :D It&#8217;s always a shock when I learn non-Filipino know Tagalog people &#8211; even now, it&#8217;s like, <em>Why?</em> Derek once explained to me that he thinks Japanese people feel the same way, which is why they were always so shocked when we showed up all Nihongo.  <em>Why would you bother learning Japanese?!</em></span><br /><br />Anyway, the most interesting part thus far talks about this guy named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>, who was eloquent but not considered completely sane by his contemporaries due to his fervored attempts to connect the Greek pantheon to Christian religious figures.  In reading Homer&#8217;s works, he realized that Homer has a strange treatment of color: he hardly uses it.  Example: for almost anyone, the sea is blue.  But to Homer it is &#8220;wine-looking&#8221; &#8211; just as oxen are.  And just as iron is.  But his treatment of color is also inconsistent:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;Iron&#8230;is said to be &#8216;violet&#8217; in one passage, &#8216;gray&#8217; elsewhere, and in yet another place it is referred to as <em>aithon</em>, a term otherwise used to refer to the color of horses, lions, and oxen.&#8221;</blockquote><br />It turns out the key is in the fact that Homer references &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;white&#8221; 270 times, whereas the references to other colors put together is hardly anything.<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;He may often talk about light and brightness, but seldom does he venture beyond gray scale into the splendor of prism.  In those instances when colors are mentioned, they are often vague and highly inconsistent: his sea is wine-colored, and when not wine-colored, it is violet, just like his sheep.  His honey is green and his southern sky is anything but blue&#8230;.&#8221;</blockquote><br />And that&#8217;s the key, I guess: Homer saw the world not so much in colors as they did in lightnesses and darknesses.  The rest of the Greeks did as well, since &#8220;violet-colored hair&#8221; is seen in other Greek poetry in ancient times.<br /><br />As it turns out, the world for green, <em>chloros</em>, has an etymology which links it to &#8220;young herbage,&#8221; a fresh light green; and if you think of <em>chloros</em> as meaning more &#8220;light&#8221; than &#8220;green,&#8221; then &#8220;green honey&#8221; is really just &#8220;pale, bright honey.&#8221;  By extension, faces &#8220;green with disgust&#8221; may actually be &#8220;pale with disgust.&#8221;<br /><br />AND THAT&#8217;S WHY I WROTE THIS POST.  BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT OUR COMMONLY USED TERM, &#8220;[WHATEVER]&#8217;S FACE TURNED GREEN,&#8221; DOES NOT ACTUALLY MEAN THAT IT TURNED GREEN, BUT HAS A CONNECTION TO THE ANCIENT LACK OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE COLOR GREEN AND PALENESS <span class="shh">(maybe)</span>.<br /><br />As for &#8220;the ancient lack of blue&#8221; &#8211; I guess Goldstone&#8217;s theory is that humanity only grew to have a vivid appreciation of color when color started to matter, i.e. when artificial dyes started to become easy to come by.  Ancient Greek (and ancient Indian languages, despite their praising of T3h Heavens) lack a word for &#8220;blue.&#8221;<br /><br />And I guess perceptions of color are even changing <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/4013694698/datchan-on-the-issues-the-changing-standards-of">in more recent times</a>.<br /><br />Anyway, faces green/pale with disgust.  That&#8217;s all.</div>
