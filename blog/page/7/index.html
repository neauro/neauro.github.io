  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
One of my favorite manga short stories, <i>Hotarubi no Mori e</i>&nbsp;by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Midorikawa">Yuki&nbsp;</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Midorikawa">Midorikawa</a>, was just made into an anime film! I&nbsp;cried after reading the story, and I cried after the&nbsp;animated film ended too. One would think that already&nbsp;knowing the ending would have removed the emotion from&nbsp;the film, but I guess not.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9xC2N3Su410/UIXweCUhwMI/AAAAAAAACq4/dbbR2tLSPQg/s1600/hotarubi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9xC2N3Su410/UIXweCUhwMI/AAAAAAAACq4/dbbR2tLSPQg/s400/hotarubi.jpg" width="282" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">tears everywhere, seriously (<a href="https://minniemeorange.wordpress.com/2012/03/04/anime-movie-review-hotarubi-no-mori-e/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />[spoilers ahead]<br /><br />I haven&#8217;t read much manga recently, but what stories&nbsp;I&#8217;ve read from Midorikawa still remain glowing in my&nbsp;memory. She always takes a single, strange premise &#8211; <a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=11498">a criminal investigator that can make people do as he says</a>, <a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=6781">a boy who inherits his grandmother&#8217;s &#8220;book of names&#8221; of spirits</a> &#8211; and uses story to cast light into the unique possibilities given by that premise, really stretches and shines it out to its full potential.<br /><i><br /></i><i>Hotarubi no&nbsp;</i><i>Mori e</i> in particular is my favorite of hers, because it&#8217;s so wonderfully concise, whole, and  focused. A human and a spirit meet and become friends, despite a peculiar limitation: if the spirit ever encounters human touch, he will vanish from the world.<br /><br />Significant events and points of growth in the characters&#8217; relationship revolve around the problem of contact. When the two first meet, they carry a stick between them to hold hands. One day, when the human falls from a tree, the spirit races to catch her &#8211; before pulling back at the last moment to let her crash. Afterward, she weeps &#8211; &#8220;Never touch me, ever!&#8221; &#8211; and those different facets of the premise sparkle to light. You understand it without the burden of over-narration; you understand simply, just as it happens. <i>He can&#8217;t protect her. He can&#8217;t even comfort her</i>. You watch her sob and sob and the spirit sits close by, face hidden by his mask.<br /><br />When people say that they just <i>had</i>&nbsp;to keep reading/watching/consuming because they want to see what will happen &#8211; this story really dazed me with that desperation. The conflict seems so <i>impossible</i>&nbsp;&#8211; you know what&#8217;s going to happen, what <i>must</i>&nbsp;happen &#8211; but does it? Is there any other way that this story could end?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and find out! :)</div>

The herbs are a thai basil and a stevia, both gifted to me from a &#8220;free&#8221; bin at the farmer&#8217;s market. I&#8217;m not really sure what I&#8217;ll do with either of them yet, particularly since I think the thai basil is about to flower and die soon.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L_zeF7hF-uM/UHIIWJIsM_I/AAAAAAAACnE/EhMxMb8bS8s/s1600/limetreestevia.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="446" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L_zeF7hF-uM/UHIIWJIsM_I/AAAAAAAACnE/EhMxMb8bS8s/s640/limetreestevia.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">indoor homies</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The stevia is getting pretty tall so I may try and <a href="http://www.stevia.com/Stevia_article/Growing_Your_Own_Stevia/8077">cut it back as suggested</a>, though my inner novice worries that an entire plant might just go belly up after being nipped.</div>

On the recommendation of my friend, I checked out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312362919/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312362919&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day</a>&nbsp;from the library and attempted its secrets.<br /><br />Having never made bread before and heard much of the difficulty of doing so, I was pretty skeptical. In the end it did not, in fact, take me five minutes, but forty or so minutes (from &#8220;cloaking&#8221; the bread to throwing it in the oven to eating it with delight) is not that bad.<br /><br />My first attempt was remarkably crusty and white and fluffy inside.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JNgwvcLgeaQ/UHIMz0kzc1I/AAAAAAAACoM/ROtgu_MxL98/s1600/goodbread.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JNgwvcLgeaQ/UHIMz0kzc1I/AAAAAAAACoM/ROtgu_MxL98/s640/goodbread.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">WHOA. did i really do that?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My second attempt was crusted with soot as black as midnight and filled the entire house with smoke besides. But, the inside was still white and fluffy!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Uq0DV5pgJFE/UHIM-t_m0cI/AAAAAAAACoU/5Y8NfxOumXU/s1600/bread.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="346" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Uq0DV5pgJFE/UHIM-t_m0cI/AAAAAAAACoU/5Y8NfxOumXU/s640/bread.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">and edible!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Another first for me was creating pancakes from a macadamia-nut studded mix.

I went with Selesnya because of course. Playstyle-wise (and flavor-wise), I resonate with it more. Plus I love the security of green&#8217;s fixing.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uBFjufDIWRo/UGj3cpTY-kI/AAAAAAAACkk/CsSHHZ4wVDA/s1600/selesnya.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="556" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uBFjufDIWRo/UGj3cpTY-kI/AAAAAAAACkk/CsSHHZ4wVDA/s640/selesnya.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">for the conclave!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I have to say I <i>really</i>&nbsp;enjoyed the set-up of RTR&#8217;s pre-release, especially with the boxes and stickers and even a free little spin-down in guild colors (which I unfortunately lost somehow after my last match :( ). Izzet and Golgari were the first sold out at the pre-release that I attended, though I was so sure people would be eating up <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=archon+of+the+triumvirate&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">the Azorius promo</a>. Selesnya and Rakdos were left for last, but after having the opportunity to play against all the guilds, Rakdos really seems to be the strongest in this format, to me, given that it can make use of <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=carnival+hellsteed&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Carnival Hellsteed</a> right off the bat (attacking as a&nbsp;<i>first strike 6/5 wat</i>), has many not-bad commons, and can even make use of Golgari&#8217;s scavenge creatures (imagine scavenging counters onto <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=270349">Daggerdrome Imp</a> or something&#8230;wah!)<br /><br />My decklist:<br /><br /><i>Creatures</i><br />2x Azorius Arrester<br />2x Centaur&#8217;s Herald<br />2x Centaur Healer<br />2x Gatecreeper Vine<br />1x Fencing Ace<br />1x Seller of Songbirds<br />1x Rubbleback Rhino<br /><i><br /></i><i>Spells/Artifacts</i><br />1x Street Spasm<br />1x Druid&#8217;s Deliverance<br />2x Trostani&#8217;s Judgment<br />1x Eyes in the Skies<br />1x Coursers&#8217; Accord<br />1x Call of the Conclave<br />1x Mana Bloom<br />1x Avenging Arrow<br />1x Explosive Impact<br />1x Sundering Growth<br />1x Seek the Horizon<br />1x Collective Blessing (mwahaha)<br />1x Izzet Keyrune<br /><br /><i>Land/Gates</i><br />5x Forest<br />4x Plains<br />1x Mountain<br />2x Selesnya Guildgate<br />2x Transguild Promenade<br />1x Izzet Guildgate<br />1x Grove of the Guardian<br /><i><br /></i>Populate is <i>so fun</i>. Out of all of the pre-release promos, <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=grove+of+the+guardian&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Grove of the Guardian</a> definitely felt like it was the one with the most synergy with its colors and keywords. The number of times I was able to pop and then populate an 8/8 token and was not insubstantial. And once I managed it, no one was able to bring it/them down, though one Golgari opponent kept fishing for his <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=abrupt+decay&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Abrupt Decay</a>, in vain. I&#8217;m glad that I decided to stick straight with a populate theme, though cracking a <a href="http://magiccards.info/rtr/en/183.html">Niv-Mizzet</a> in my first pack and an <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=epic+experiment&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Epic Experiment</a> in my second did make it so I was <i>really</i>&nbsp;tempted to splash both red and blue, which I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t.<br /><br />Something I missed was the keywords for RTR playing into some world story. Innistrad&#8217;s keywords (transforming, morbid, etc.) really spoke to the general atmosphere of the world and its creatures, as well as providing interesting play. I guess the &#8220;story&#8221; of RTR really may just involve guilds all fighting each other, but it would be nice if there was something a little more than that, which you can soak up without delving into pages of a wiki.<br /><br />I ended up going three and one, and drew a Trostani in one of my reward packs! Constructed Populate deck, here I come~<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LzGKc_AeqDA/UGj3dMkD5dI/AAAAAAAACks/Nkzs_H9VFx4/s1600/boosters.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="478" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LzGKc_AeqDA/UGj3dMkD5dI/AAAAAAAACks/Nkzs_H9VFx4/s640/boosters.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wooooo</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></div>

Ever since Leilani told me about them, I&#8217;ve been absolutely obsessed with doing <em>vermicompost</em>, aka getting a box, filling it with worms, and leaving my organic materials in there to rot and be eaten and transformed into ~*castings*~ after about six months.<br /><br />Step 1: Get the box. In this case, two Rubbermaid boxes into which were easily drilled rows and columns of holes. The holey one is meant for the worms; the one without the holes is meant to gather what I believe some people refer to as &#8220;worm tea.&#8221;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9kSBfcX8CpE/UGaJA8WN0hI/AAAAAAAACjM/vQv6hzFzpR0/s1600/DSC_0001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9kSBfcX8CpE/UGaJA8WN0hI/AAAAAAAACjM/vQv6hzFzpR0/s400/DSC_0001.jpg" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">break out that drill</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Step 2: Get and prepare the&nbsp;bedding&nbsp; Actually, I got the worms first before preparing the&nbsp;bedding&nbsp; which consisted of an issue of Real Change and some pages from The Stranger (torn haphazardly into one-inch, stripper-ad-covered strips), and a bunch of old peanut shells and bok choy ends from that night&#8217;s <a href="http://rasamalaysia.com/recipe-kung-pao-chicken/2/">dinner</a>. Because worms thrive in a wet environment, you&#8217;re supposed to <a href="http://organicgardening.about.com/od/compost/ss/setupawormbin_4.htm">soak the papers until they feel like a damp sponge</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7YUalRY0ACc/UGaJCEJFC9I/AAAAAAAACjk/qiCVGrlvrXg/s1600/worms.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7YUalRY0ACc/UGaJCEJFC9I/AAAAAAAACjk/qiCVGrlvrXg/s640/worms.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">worms and bedding</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Step 3: Once the beddings are prepared, put in the worms! We got these worms from <a href="http://www.stonewayhardware.com/">Stoneway Hardware</a>, which seemed to be one of the few places in Seattle that have them in supply. At first glance the canister seemed full of dirt, but after curiously (and then furiously) drumming out the clump of soil from the bottom of the canister, we stared in shock and not a little abrupt nausea at the wriggly, thrashing mass.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q4-AEPVyFg4/UGaJBkon9OI/AAAAAAAACjc/Cc0qV_eLn4E/s1600/wormbin.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q4-AEPVyFg4/UGaJBkon9OI/AAAAAAAACjc/Cc0qV_eLn4E/s640/wormbin.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">worms!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />They thrashed away from the light, some of them so vehemently that they fell down the drill holes and had to be rescued and placed back amidst the feast. We then covered the tub with a thin layer of <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/autumn-perennial-planting.html">compost</a> (having heard that compost can be full of helpful microbes) and placed it lovingly inside an empty cabinet for easy disposal of plant-based debris.<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard to say what really attracted me to vermicompost, but I guess it&#8217;s the idea that you&#8217;re <em>closing the circle</em> &#8211; putting some of your food to the creatures who will help you convert it into stuff to help more plant foods grow. I guess it doesn&#8217;t hurt that I really enjoy taking care of things in general, especially when &#8220;taking care of things&#8221; consists of placing a bok choy end in a cabinet every now and then.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CExg13WO2sg/UGaJBJdqisI/AAAAAAAACjU/31e28x48Grw/s1600/cabinet.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CExg13WO2sg/UGaJBJdqisI/AAAAAAAACjU/31e28x48Grw/s400/cabinet.jpg" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">thar be worms</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
This past week has been busy with moving, the start of my new job, and the start of autumn quarter, but at some point we finally found time to plant the starters that we (well, I) bought (starry-eyed) at various nurseries.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve spent the past couple weeks reading books to raise my gardening level a little higher  before attempting The Real Thing. Library discoveries include <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046HAJ9K/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0046HAJ9K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Talking Dirt</a></em> by Annie Spiegelman, and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1604692200/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1604692200&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Decoding Gardening Advice: The Science Behind the 100 Most Common Recommendations</a></em>, by Jeff Gillman and Meleah Maynard. Both are incredibly readable and filled with great beginner information, especially for someone like me, who scarce knew the difference compost and mulch. Yes, they are different! And they do different things! Whoa! Both books are also incredibly forgiving and advise constant questioning of advice and continued experimentation and learning. So&#8230;here we go!<br /><br />Now knowing that &#8220;compost&#8221; is something which can be added to the dirt of places to make it all-around better for plant growth, we purchased some large bags and amended the beds around the back of the house, which (though covered appealing rich brown mulch) proved to be mostly rocky, pale dirt. Thereafter we planted some packets of seeds that seem to be ready to plant at about this time: overwintering carrots, swiss chard, spinach, cilantro. I am wary of seeds, especially since we just planted them straight in rather than growing them indoors beneath a light or something first, but I guess we&#8217;ll see what happens with these.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_6POawL7UHs/UGaD1ijHJQI/AAAAAAAACh0/aF87yH46bF8/s1600/dirt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_6POawL7UHs/UGaD1ijHJQI/AAAAAAAACh0/aF87yH46bF8/s640/dirt.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dat compost</td></tr></tbody></table><br />We also transplanted <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/things-ive-learned-about-my-new.html">that blueberry bush</a>, which had &#8211; since the time I bought it &#8211; started exhibiting an alarming amount of yellowing leaves, as well as leaves that curled at their edges and became a pale brick-red color that was soft to the touch. Maybe scorch? Maybe a fungus? Maybe a canker? Maybe the effect of general nutrients or acidity leaking from its black gallon pot? In any case, we transplanted it into a corner of the beds with some scoops of azalea/rhododendron fertilizer to make up for any acidity the soil may not have, since I was a bad gardener and haven&#8217;t checked the pH yet&#8230;I was too nervous of leaving it to wilt further in that container.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCFJTyJfdXA/UGaD0vaYXQI/AAAAAAAAChk/UPMkWr-QYvY/s1600/blueberry.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCFJTyJfdXA/UGaD0vaYXQI/AAAAAAAAChk/UPMkWr-QYvY/s640/blueberry.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sorry, blueberry plant :(</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It&#8217;s had some new young leaves since this last photo, which hopefully grew not just because of the burst of nitrogen in the fertilizer, which apparently can cause new growth that then just dies in winter because it isn&#8217;t strong enough to withstand the cold. (Which is why fertilizers should be applied in spring, I suppose. Then again, another part of one of these books says it&#8217;s best to plant perennials in autumn, when hot weather isn&#8217;t there to stress them into not forming good roots&#8230;ahh!)<br /><br />One thing learned from these books is that, when buying perennials, it&#8217;s better to choose a small, unblooming candidate. Small plants are better able to withstand transplanting, and if they don&#8217;t yet have blooms, they can focus more of their energy on growing strong roots. It&#8217;s also important to make sure that plants aren&#8217;t&nbsp;root-bound,&nbsp;which can be checked by tipping the plant out of its pot and making sure the roots are white, not encircling the pot, and not smelly.<br /><br />Anyway, one of the new starters we got was a lemon balm.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-saSzMt32Ewk/UGaD2mNrhpI/AAAAAAAACiE/xUQsOrmTFUM/s1600/lemonbalm.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-saSzMt32Ewk/UGaD2mNrhpI/AAAAAAAACiE/xUQsOrmTFUM/s640/lemonbalm.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small; text-align: start;">lovely smelly smell</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Lemonbalm is part of the mint family, and is fragrant as all hell. You only need to touch the stems or leaves to have your hands come away with an inexplicably lemony and lovely aroma. It&#8217;s apparently quite easy to take care of (even to the point of growing flush with more pruning?). For now it&#8217;s by the front door so that we can grope it every time we leave.<br /><br />Beside it is a rosemary because of course.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FttRcXtdwa8/UGaD3WJ-MKI/AAAAAAAACiM/qvViGHxF1Gs/s1600/rosemary.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FttRcXtdwa8/UGaD3WJ-MKI/AAAAAAAACiM/qvViGHxF1Gs/s640/rosemary.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">like duh</td></tr></tbody></table><br />They&#8217;re hardy enough that they grow on sidewalks here, tempting passersby to take a sprig despite the likelihood of such a sidewalk denizen having been&nbsp;anointed&nbsp;with pesticides or (worse) dog pee. In any case, rosemary always struck me as an uncomplaining garden occupant with the advantage of yielding omelette-friendly seasoning.<br /><br />Beside <em>that</em> is a stout chocolate mint, which some years ago I had tried to grow on a windowsill, to no avail. These seem a bit more sturdy than my previous twig of a chocolate mint, so here&#8217;s hoping the mint family is as vigorous as people complain about, and can withstand my less-than-masterful attempts to support its survival.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C0zBJTfrP38/UGaD1BZFGbI/AAAAAAAAChs/xrVn2y7n1bM/s1600/chocomint.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C0zBJTfrP38/UGaD1BZFGbI/AAAAAAAAChs/xrVn2y7n1bM/s640/chocomint.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">good luck, little one</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The last plant we planted in was an agatasche, or &#8220;hummingbird mint,&#8221; which can possibly attract hummingbirds, if they indeed exist here.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6qsoAsvB9eQ/UGaD0G7GYwI/AAAAAAAAChc/WHtiv-L-F-k/s1600/agastache.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6qsoAsvB9eQ/UGaD0G7GYwI/AAAAAAAAChc/WHtiv-L-F-k/s640/agastache.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i think i saw one here once?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In general it was an attractive enough plant that I decided to forego my want of only edible gardening plants to obtain it. Presently it&#8217;s planted in the bed around the monkey-tail tree, which makes me a little nervous since one of the things these books said was, <em>Don&#8217;t raise a garden around the trunk of the tree!</em> This can apparently smother the roots there, and can lead to a greater chance of diseases or fungi attacking the tree. I believe that this garden was placed around the tree to make the house look pretty before we moved in, but A doesn&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s large enough to really harm the tree. I hope so, because the tree is so large and beautiful that it would be a shame if it died&#8230;<br /><br />So, yeah, anyway, to be honest I didn&#8217;t really check the rootbounded-ness of any of these perennials, nor am I entirely sure, having already planted them, whether they were overly-rootbound or not&#8230;but as of this morning they were still alive, so, that&#8217;s good.<br /><br />While digging up the front beds to place in new plants, we ended up unearthing some mysterious bulbs which look a lot like garlic but may not be. Planted here by previous tenants perhaps? Some of them were sadly crushed, but I&#8217;ll re-plant them once the earth cools down a little and I&#8217;m ready to plant some tulips I received as a gift.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi_JALLdVAI/UGaD2Bn8rCI/AAAAAAAACh8/7rwT0jBdT6E/s1600/garlic.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi_JALLdVAI/UGaD2Bn8rCI/AAAAAAAACh8/7rwT0jBdT6E/s640/garlic.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">we&#8217;ll see what occurs later</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></div>

In contrast, organization in the form of boards is Pinterest&#8217;s foundation, and it also very easily keeps tracks of images and their source links for you. It&#8217;s also easy to skim even huge piles for what you want, or easy to just skim them with a smug sense of satisfaction at your gathered knowledge.<br /><br />Pinterest!

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So at the end of last May, I acquired a pair of air plants from a street fair, both of them mid-bloom. The one on the left is, I think, some kind of <i>Tillandsia&nbsp;stricta</i> (maybe the &#8221;<i>stricta rio</i>&#8221;?). I&#8217;m pretty sure the one on the right is <i>Tillandsia ionantha.</i><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zBiiauAqi3A/UE5Ia1nN2wI/AAAAAAAACdU/1yIk4UawYfQ/s1600/tillandsia1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zBiiauAqi3A/UE5Ia1nN2wI/AAAAAAAACdU/1yIk4UawYfQ/s640/tillandsia1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i left the flowers on even after they died because i thought it they still looked a little festive&#8230;</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After I bought them I started looking up how to take care of them, and was a disappointed that many websites say that air plants are monocarpic, meaning they flower once and die. (That&#8217;s what I get from picking the prettiest plants from the bargain bin, I guess.)<br /><br />Other things learned about air plants at the time:<br /><br /><ul><li>they need watering about once a week</li><li>though you can mist them to water them, it&#8217;s better to just dunk them underneath a sink to soak them them all the way through</li><li>air plant roots are primarily used for holding onto things, not for absorbing water</li><li>make sure to shake plants so they don&#8217;t have water pooling in crevices or near roots</li><li>hard water, which has a lot of minerals, can clog up the filaments in tillandsia leaves that draw in the plant&#8217;s nutrients; luckily, Pacific Northwest tap water is some of the softest water in the US ;D</li><li>filtered light (which is sunlight that goes through some sort of filter, like a window), is best</li><li>after air plants flower, they may reproduce, creating a new offset which is called a &#8220;pup&#8221;</li></ul><div><br />So I guess the plants might &#8220;pup&#8221;? I started a (somewhat inconsistent) regimen of dunk-watering about once a week. Four months later, I<i>&nbsp;</i>abruptly realized that my air plants <i>are</i>&nbsp;having pups!</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8230;I think? In any case, the <i>stricta</i> appears to have a little dent in its clutch of spiny leaves where something looks to be emerging:</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9e7VYtF_2uo/UE5Qp_Y7SmI/AAAAAAAACeU/HTakw2cvUn0/s1600/tillandsia2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9e7VYtF_2uo/UE5Qp_Y7SmI/AAAAAAAACeU/HTakw2cvUn0/s640/tillandsia2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">it&#8217;s a little blurry&#8230;</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After searching for a similar dent in the <i>ionata</i>, I realized that it the whole thing was in fact quickly becoming two plants:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-47Vq3KXPhwU/UE5RPuJm6DI/AAAAAAAACec/z605d1A5X6U/s1600/tillandsia3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-47Vq3KXPhwU/UE5RPuJm6DI/AAAAAAAACec/z605d1A5X6U/s640/tillandsia3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">near my thumb there!</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Hurray :)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.justairplants.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=68">It seems</a> that you can separate pups from the mother plant after they are about 1/2 or a 1/3 the size of the parent, but I&#8217;m not sure if I will yet. It also seems that plants show &#8220;an&nbsp;exaggeration&nbsp;of the natural curvation of their leaves&#8221; if they don&#8217;t have enough water so&#8230;oops. @__@ I thought these curves were pretty attractive but I guess I should soak these plants overnight. Which seems like it would kill them, but I haven&#8217;t found a source yet that says air plants are capable of being overwatered.<br /><br />Finding a book about air plants would be better than the soup of websites I&#8217;ve been finding, but I haven&#8217;t yet discovered one. Another book I&#8217;d like to find: one that discusses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marimo">marimo</a>, my newest &#8220;easy to care for living thing&#8221; interest.</div>

The exception is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/dragon-flight/id530610467?mt=8">Dragon Flight</a> by Next Floor, a simple dragon-themed shooter. Long story short: put your finger over the character, swipe left and right to eliminate rows of evil/cute monsters, collect the coins and jewels upon expelled upon monsters&#8217; expiration.<br /><br />Coins gathered mid-fray can be used to purchase increasingly expensive upgrades, which make your bullets cooler-looking and faster at killing things, which is nice. The system is clean-cut: farm dragons, upgrade to farm dragons better, farm more dragons. In the background is a high score based on how many meters you were able to cross before dying, which provides a pretty sensible long-term goal in each individual, short game. There are also power-ups you can collect mid-fray (&#8220;shoot twice as many bullets;&#8221; &#8220;become invincible and shoot forward for two seconds or so;&#8221; etc.) which mix things up a little.<br /><br />About the only bewildering thing to me is the other score system, which allots you points based on the types of dragons you killed, white dragons yielding like 100 points and tougher, yellow ones yielding 500 (or something). And sometimes when you kill a dragon a &#8220;2x&#8221; or &#8220;3x&#8221; or something pops up overhead? I&#8217;m still not sure what this means, though presumably it rewards the player for going on streaks of killing only a certain color of dragon, which is difficult to plan out when rows of randomly-arranged dragons appear and rush away in the space of seconds. I&#8217;ve been musing about what purpose having both a score based on &#8220;This is how far you went!&#8221; and a &#8220;This is how many points you won!&#8221; score might serve. For example, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris#Scoring">Tetris</a>,&nbsp;clearing lines as soon as possible help you stay in the game longer (and keeps your stress level low), whereas making a &#8220;tetris&#8221; or clearing four lines at once rewards more points.<br /><br />Anyway, I haven&#8217;t found my answer yet, but it may be because all I care about is farming dragons (<i>give me that 8000 coin dragon egg dammit omg</i>).<br /><br />Other slightly annoying thing: placing your finger directly over the player-character to navigate her obstructs her from view, which means it can be hard to catch falling treasure. Because the screen reads movement no matter where your finger is, I experimented with navigating the player-character while holding my finger near the top of the screen, but then I couldn&#8217;t see where I was shooting. I haven&#8217;t thought of any possible alternatives yet for this, other than tilt-based controlling, which seems like it would be too slow for twitchy treasure-catching.<br /><br />Anyway~ Dragon Flight is a simple and satisfying time-waster, but I can&#8217;t wait until I can replace it with gardening and Return to Ravnica :D</div>

Now award-winning author Mark Kurlansky tells the remarkable story of New York by following the trajectory of one of its most fascinating inhabitants &#8211; the oyster, whose influence on the great metropolis remains unparalleled.<br /><br />For centuries New York was famous for its oysters, which until the early 1900s played such a dominant role in the city&#8217;s economy, gastronomy, and ecology that the abundant bivalves were Gotham&#8217;s most celebrated export, a staple food for the wealthy, the poor, and tourists alike, and the primary natural defense against pollution for the city&#8217;s congested waterways.<br /><br />Filled with cultural, historical, and culinary insight &#8211; along with historic recipes, maps, drawings, and photos &#8211; this dynamic narrative sweeps readers from the island hunting ground of the Lenape Indians to the death of the oyster beds at the rise of America&#8217;s environmentalist movement, from the oyster cellars of the rough-and-tumble Five Points slums to Manhattan&#8217;s poshest Gilded Age dining chambers.</i></blockquote><br />Reading history in general is a lot more palatable to me when it anchors itself on a single thing, especially if that thing is a food item (haha?). As such, I picked up&nbsp;<i>The Big Oyster:</i>&nbsp;a history of New York that revolves around a bivalve that apparently was once so populous there that people were like, &#8220;Oh, well, if poor people can&#8217;t afford to buy food, at least they can just dredge up oysters to eat!&#8221;<br /><br />It&#8217;s a book that made me wince at every page with the sheer amount of environmental pollution that people are willing to inflict on their environments, especially when the feedback of such destructive actions isn&#8217;t clear enough (like if all your sewage sinks into the bay, below sight&#8230;and right on the oyster beds). Consider &#8220;the Collect:&#8221;<br /><br /><blockquote><i>This pond where the Lenape [Native Americans] once fished, where the Dutch picnicked on an adjacent hill to have a view of it, was becoming a mucky, malarial swamp, strewn with trash and festering with disease.</i></blockquote><br />Or the quality of water in Manhattan:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Also, the city was running out of fresh water. The drinking water came from local wells that caught the rainwater that washed down the foul streets. By midcentury, the quality of Manhattan water had become so bad that out-of-town horses refused to drink it.</i></blockquote><br />Or what happened after the American Revolution:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Discarded trash would start to fill in around the piers and merchants, rather than cleaning it out, would extend the docks farther out and finish filling in the trash area with landfill until they had added several blocks to lower Manhattan at the expense of the East River, the harbor, and the Hudson.</i></blockquote><br />AAAAHHHH ;____;<br /><br />Something else that I appreciated about the book was that it didn&#8217;t stick strictly to the history of white settlers to New York, but also discussed the activities of people of color.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The first black in Manhattan was an explorer named Jan Rodrigues who came on a Dutch ship in 1613 [&#8230;] By the 1630s, a free black community had been established north of the pond. By 1750, Manhattan was 18 percent black, comparable to today&#8217;s ratio.</i></blockquote><br />And, did you know about Thomas Downing, who owned the Downing&#8217;s restaurant from 1830 to 1860, New York&#8217;s &#8220;most celebrated oyster cellar,&#8221; which catered Charles Dickens&#8217; visit to the United States? Downing also sent oysters to Queen Victoria, which she repaid by giving him a gold watch. Pretty cooool.<br /><br />There&#8217;s also notes made of women; here&#8217;s one concerning the opening of the Delmonica cafe, around 1824:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>For Americans, the initial curiosity of was the first female cashier they had ever seen, a new concept, entrusting women with money.</i></blockquote><br />That&#8217;s less than <i>200 years ago</i>. Also happening around this time: not women, but men doing grocery shopping and bringing the bags home. Because, as one man put it, &#8220;The man who was ashamed to carry home his dinner didn&#8217;t deserve any.&#8221; (Also, I guess men could more easily wade through the filth of the marketplaces, as they are socialized to wear trousers rather than long dresses. See how sexism hurts everybody?)<br /><br />There are, of course, a fair share of interesting oyster tidbits:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Producers discovered that oysters are educable. The grower would choose plump, large oysters and replant them closer to shore where they would be exposed for a few hours a day in low tide. After a few days, they would move the oysters a little farther up so that they were exposed for a few minutes longer in low tides. [&#8230;] The oysters learned to take a long hard drink before the water retreated and eventually would hold the water the entire time they were exposed.</i></blockquote>In conclusion: fun, easy to read, informative, inclusive.</div>
