@jshou I was thinking about it!  I was thinking I could probably make a set of my favorites on Flickr and then randomly populate them everytime that page loads.</div>

I&#8217;ve always been more of a cat person, but recently I&#8217;ve been mad for shiba inu.  I found one in the FarmVille suite and it made my day.  I&#8217;m too shy to visit him all the time, but it&#8217;s enough to see him now and again.<br /><br />I found another shiba at the company meeting, and, typical of shiba aloofness with strangers, he did not care in the slightest that I adored him.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-74D_Hl1tbpk/Ti-wzOFiDcI/AAAAAAAAAUE/ZcMr3K-nsoc/s1600/DSC_0119%2B%25282%2529.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-74D_Hl1tbpk/Ti-wzOFiDcI/AAAAAAAAAUE/ZcMr3K-nsoc/s640/DSC_0119%2B%25282%2529.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh whoa i found a stick lol nom nom nom</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I cannot really explain why I started loving shiba inu with the abruptness and ferocity with which I did despite my general &#8220;:|&#8221; feeling about dogs, but it probably has something to do with this video, at least initially:<br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_uIshkpeXko" width="425"></iframe></center><br /><br />(More videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL957844FC81969564&amp;feature=mh_lolz">here</a>!)<br /><br />During breaks at work I&#8217;ve been searching for shiba inu-related stuff to read, and found <a href="http://juicybits.com/Shosha/_history.php">History and Tradition of the Japanese Shiba-Inu by Julia Cadwell</a>.  It goes,<br /><br /><blockquote>Today’s Shiba has been bred by careful mixing of many strains of small Japanese dogs.</blockquote><br />And then,<br /><br /><blockquote>The first impression the Japanese Shiba Dog creates is a lack of sophistication—a touch of nature that has escaped human forced breeding. Actually the Japanese Shiba Dog has escaped much artificiality that accompanies improvement and fixation of species.</blockquote><br /><em>lol wat</em><br /><br />In other news, this idea of shiba inu being attractive because they are in part so wild and &#8220;not completely obedient&#8221; reminds me intensely of tea ceremony aestheticism, of the beauty it finds in odd numbers, in asymmetrical and lumpy pottery, in things that are perfect because of their imperfection.<br /><br />Finding a job and then finding a shibanakama are some of the reasons why I am excited to return home. :3</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;ve done a lot of exploring in San Francisco this past weekend, as my more city-savvy friends have returned from Japan.  One of them lamented having not known about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format">raws</a> before going, and we had a conversation about it, with me mostly being like, <em>Dude, raw may make your pictures better but so does having the proper aperture, shutter speed, white balance, ISO,</em> etc.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve only tried shooting raw once, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=11378171@N02&amp;q=%22golden%20gardens%22">with somewhat non-exceptional results</a>.  The only thing that came out of this experience was that raws took forever to edit (on my poor, slow computer) and I didn&#8217;t really see much difference in quality.<br /><br />Fast forward to exploration weekend, wherein I decided I would give raws another shot (if you will) and then realized that <em>they are really cool</em>.  There are <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/u-raw-files.shtml">other places</a> where you can learn exactly what raws are, so I won&#8217;t go into that here, but rather just talk about my experiences.<br /><br />What I found really amazing about the raw images that I took was the capacity that I had to edit them.  With my normal fine jpegs, I pretty much just threw them into Photoshop, and adjusted the middle bar of Levels slightly to the right to get rid of some of the grays.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hQG8cREC90M/Ti5OEXhbfvI/AAAAAAAAATE/b3uwemzEG4g/s1600/lessgraylol.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="198" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hQG8cREC90M/Ti5OEXhbfvI/AAAAAAAAATE/b3uwemzEG4g/s320/lessgraylol.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">now it&#8217;s less gray lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And that was about the extent of my editing, unless I was trying to fix white balance or whatever.  Occasionally I would touch the other two bars, but pictures would inevitably look way too bright or way too dark afterward.  Plus, editing was pretty linear &#8211; stuff as a whole would just keep getting brighter (and way too bright), or else much darker.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7Cj8Myg8VI/Ti5Op5X5iGI/AAAAAAAAATM/37N4R2Ll0eQ/s1600/lessgraylol2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7Cj8Myg8VI/Ti5Op5X5iGI/AAAAAAAAATM/37N4R2Ll0eQ/s320/lessgraylol2.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">now it&#8217;s more white lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Enter raws, which are apparently just like having an undeveloped shot of film, in which all its possibilities of exposure are retained.  Also enter the Conservatory of Flowers, which is what I did in order to take tons of pictures of flowers, despite the fact that flower picture-taking is uber-typical.  Here is my original photo of a flower &#8211;<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yEDrWjcps4w/Ti5Pdj-LUQI/AAAAAAAAATU/j7XaEkY1-HI/s1600/sunday72.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yEDrWjcps4w/Ti5Pdj-LUQI/AAAAAAAAATU/j7XaEkY1-HI/s320/sunday72.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />And here are two edited versions &#8211;<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_oo9KWAgCFM/Ti5PmQ47RyI/AAAAAAAAATc/mlRl2t_CTTI/s1600/sunday71.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_oo9KWAgCFM/Ti5PmQ47RyI/AAAAAAAAATc/mlRl2t_CTTI/s320/sunday71.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EuepuPwp_e4/Ti5PqbMa1UI/AAAAAAAAATk/wph0yhVEmK4/s1600/sunday73.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EuepuPwp_e4/Ti5PqbMa1UI/AAAAAAAAATk/wph0yhVEmK4/s320/sunday73.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><em>Where did all that detail come from?!</em><br /><br />Had I been editing a jpeg from that original, I assure you that the only thing I would have known how to do is make that shit even whiter than it already was.  Or else make everything around it as black as my soul.  Though I have to admit that a likely cause of this is just the fact that using Photoshop tools is like reaching for something in a huge, bubbling cauldron and slapping it on your picture &#8211; you don&#8217;t really know what you&#8217;re doing and you&#8217;re never really quite sure what will happen.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dtsf4qr3b74/Ti5RtKqc6dI/AAAAAAAAATs/Mg_gfs-UtA0/s1600/lolol.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dtsf4qr3b74/Ti5RtKqc6dI/AAAAAAAAATs/Mg_gfs-UtA0/s320/lolol.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">what wait oh no why</td></tr></tbody></table><br />On the other hand, the workflow for editing a raw in the Mac that I&#8217;m borrowing is pretty self-explanatory.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HDutWQ33XJ4/Ti5T4iYqylI/AAAAAAAAAT8/eQy32YMjnrI/s1600/cameraraw.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="211" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HDutWQ33XJ4/Ti5T4iYqylI/AAAAAAAAAT8/eQy32YMjnrI/s320/cameraraw.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh, so those are the things i can do?<br />and i can see what changes they make to the picture immediately?<br />okay.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Anyway.  My notable observations on raw are as follows:<br /><br /><ul><li>Raw files take up too much dang space. &nbsp;My 4GB memory card can handle 1,500+ fine JPEGs like a badass. &nbsp;It can hold about 400 raws.</li><li>This means that my normal methods of &#8220;TAKE AS MANY PICTURES AS YOU CAN AND MAYBE THREE OF THEM WILL BE OKAY&#8221; won&#8217;t work here.</li><li>Then again, the reason why I had to take so many pictures was because so many of them turned out irreversibly poor. &nbsp;And if I could <i>edit </i>them&#8230;</li><li>Even though it sucks to have less space, I don&#8217;t actually mind it &#8211; throughout this past weekend I found myself being more thoughtful about what pictures to take, and being more vicious about which ones to immediately delete if I didn&#8217;t like them. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not just memory that I need to take into account &#8211; it&#8217;s the fact that every picture I save will require some minutes of editing, which, in my busy busy day is worth &nbsp; a ton. &nbsp;I&#8217;m already two days behind in my&nbsp;<a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/30_day_challenge">San Francisco Summer thing</a>&nbsp;I&#8217;m trying to do.</li><li>Being more thoughtful in the actual picture-taking process is, to me, a refreshing change.</li><li>Plus, in the actual editing I really feel more connected and appreciative of each picture, and thus more like I&#8217;ve actually accomplished something meaningful for myself, etc.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>That being said, aside from pictures which will be explicitly harvested for panorama purposes, I think I&#8217;m going to do my best to stick to raw file formats as a default from now on, the same way that I moved somewhat mysteriously from always-auto to always-manual settings. &nbsp;Still, I think it&#8217;s important to have a handle on aperture/shutter speed/ISO and all that, since a raw file format can&#8217;t fix blur. &nbsp;(That I know of.) &nbsp;And you know me, I&#8217;m liek totally super pro photog, so listen up.</div></div>

It was a pretty interesting ride, around 3 and a half hours by BART and bus from San Francisco to Antioch, though most of it was waiting for the buses on a Sunday, when transportation in general is sparse.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O4qVxi104B0/TiU5_GGVllI/AAAAAAAAAS8/8cyoXf1Q4D4/s1600/DSC_0158.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O4qVxi104B0/TiU5_GGVllI/AAAAAAAAAS8/8cyoXf1Q4D4/s640/DSC_0158.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">moar teams</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It&#8217;s fun to be in a place where people are so passionate about a game that was released <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Brothers_Melee">almost 10 years ago</a>.  I spent the winter of sophomore year rabidly playing this game, trying to perfect my Pikachu and never quite getting the hang of wavedashing.  Andou taught me about all the big names in Smash and I even got to see Axe, who I don&#8217;t really know or follow but admire because his Pikachu is really good.  I attempted to figure out why, and it seems that fairs and dairs are bad with Pikachu?  Who knew.  They were so satisfying in the first Smash Brothers. :x<br /><br />The only thing that dimmed me a bit is the fact that the group that organizes Genesis is called &#8220;DBR,&#8221; which one of my friends admitted to me stands for &#8220;Death By Rape.&#8221;<br /><br />~___~<br /><br />&#8220;They&#8217;re really nice people,&#8221; Andou told me, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s true &#8211; the tournament is well-attended and well-beloved, it seems that relatives staffed the counter where they sold food and people were shaken and concerned when it turned out a fellow Smasher had been robbed at gunpoint one night.  It&#8217;s just sad that a word that stands for so much violence and pain has become so normalized in this community.  Walk by any television and it&#8217;s a litany of, &#8221;<em>SUCK HIS DICK!

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
San Francisco has been great!  I&#8217;ve been spending most of the time trying to get acclimated to my work environment/coworkers, as well as to the passersby here, who all say &#8220;Hi&#8221; at the last possible moment.  I end up turning around hastily and yelling &#8220;Hi!&#8221; to their backs.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve come to an uncomfortable point in my life where I have so many Web 2.0 things that I have no idea what to update, when I feel like updating something.  Most of my SF adventures are detailed on <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/one_new_sf_thing_every_day">my Tumblr</a>, where I strive to do &#8220;one new thing a day.&#8221; My reasoning for not putting that sort of stuff here is that, the stuff I put on Tumblr is more personal?  And I would prefer to reserve this blog for stuff of more professional nature, i.e. learning about programming?  There&#8217;s also a different flavor to how things get shared on Tumblr that I&#8217;m mindful of, for example, if I&#8217;m uploading pictures, all the ones of dessert go to Tumblr, whereas all my super-nicer ones (even if they include family) all go to Flickr, and everything may go indiscriminately to Facebook, etc.<br /><br />I guess on the topic of learning new things, I&#8217;ve been trying to revamp my portfolio website, but been having fun just changing things here and there, searching for the right layout.  I&#8217;m trying to learn Sinatra and it&#8217;s going well, but since my Dreamhost account doesn&#8217;t really support Rails, I may have to do the site in PHP anyway if I want to get it up faster, and try using Heroku if I&#8217;d be okay with getting it up later.</div>

So Journey presents a very different experience in which you are left kind of powerless against the environment you&#8217;re presented with.&#8221;</em></blockquote><br /><br />I haven&#8217;t felt so much hope and excitement for a game in such a long time, much less wanted to purchase a PS3 just to play something.  I&#8217;m so happy that people still make console games that aren&#8217;t just <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-6-most-ominous-trends-in-video-games/">army gamez</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g1t4KGnEj0k/TfpAk-fulHI/AAAAAAAAARI/07_xfbLCW0M/s1600/62660.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g1t4KGnEj0k/TfpAk-fulHI/AAAAAAAAARI/07_xfbLCW0M/s320/62660.jpg" width="143" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-6-most-ominous-trends-in-video-games/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It occurs to me now that I&#8217;ve always been more of a console gamer, but in the past couple years have played games mostly on the PC, most of them either older releases like Bioshock and Portal, or Flash games.  When I was younger games like Sonic the Hedgehog or Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse were fine, but nowadays I really crave story, for a game to make me think something new.  Games are too expensive to risk going beyond gunsight and realistic blood nowadays, I suppose.</div>

(It&#8217;s also meant to allow you to do simple projects without the overhead of all the Java code and learning Java, and is a good gateway programming language.)  Actually, thinking about it now, my first project with Java involving drawing a house, lifting pens and putting them down and changing colors and all.  It was the most frustrating thing ever and I&#8217;m glad I stuck with CS anyway.<br /><br />Little bundles of code for Processing are referred to as &#8220;sketches.&#8221; Here is the code in case you want to create a sketch to make tons of circles for yourself.  (It is also Tutorial 1 on the Processing website.)<br /><br /><pre class="brush:jscript">void setup() {<br />  size(480, 120);<br />  smooth();<br />}<br /><br />void draw() {<br />  if (mousePressed) {<br />    fill(0);<br />  } else {<br />    fill(255);<br />  }<br />  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);<br />}<br /></pre><br />It seems that <code>setup()</code> is called once, when the program starts running; <code>draw()</code> is called constantly, much like an <code>update()</code> function in game programming.  You can also name functions with headers like <code>void mousePressed()</code>, which is a function which would be called every time the mouse is pressed.<br /><br />After you&#8217;re done coding something with Processing, you can Export it into an applet, or an application for Windows, OSX, or Linux.  You can also just easily save frames by calling <code>saveFrame("name-of-output-picture####.png")</code>, where the hash marks will be replaced with a numbered sequence.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s sample code that deals with creating a Car object in Processing:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:jscript">Car myCar1;<br />Car myCar2; // Two objects!<br /><br />void setup() {<br />  size(200,200);<br />  // Parameters go inside the parentheses when the object is constructed.<br />  myCar1 = new Car(color(255,0,0),0,100,2); <br />  myCar2 = new Car(color(0,0,255),0,10,1);<br />}<br /><br />void draw() {<br />  background(255);<br />  myCar1.drive();<br />  myCar1.display();<br />  myCar2.drive();<br />  myCar2.display();<br />}<br /><br />// Even though there are multiple objects, we still only need one class. <br />// No matter how many cookies we make, only one cookie cutter is needed.<br />class Car { <br />  color c;<br />  float xpos;<br />  float ypos;<br />  float xspeed;<br /><br />  // The Constructor is defined with arguments.<br />  Car(color tempC, float tempXpos, float tempYpos, float tempXspeed) { <br />    c = tempC;<br />    xpos = tempXpos;<br />    ypos = tempYpos;<br />    xspeed = tempXspeed;<br />  }<br /><br />  void display() {<br />    stroke(0);<br />    fill(c);<br />    rectMode(CENTER);<br />    rect(xpos,ypos,20,10);<br />  }<br /><br />  void drive() {<br />    xpos = xpos + xspeed;<br />    if (xpos &gt; width) {<br />      xpos = 0;<br />    }<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre><br />And here&#8217;s an example of grabbing samples of color from an image:<br /><pre class="brush:jscript">for (int x = 0; x &lt; img.width; x++) {<br />  for (int y = 0; y &lt; img.height; y++ ) {<br />    // Calculate the 1D pixel location<br />    int loc = x + y*img.width;<br />    // Get the R,G,B values from image<br />    float r = red   (img.pixels[loc]);<br />    float g = green (img.pixels[loc]);<br />    float b = blue  (img.pixels[loc]);<br />    // Change brightness according to the mouse here<br />    float adjustBrightness = ((float) mouseX / width) * 8.0;<br />    r *= adjustBrightness;<br />    g *= adjustBrightness;<br />    b *= adjustBrightness;<br />    // Constrain RGB to between 0-255<br />    r = constrain(r,0,255);<br />    g = constrain(g,0,255);<br />    b = constrain(b,0,255);<br />    // Make a new color and set pixel in the window<br />    color c = color(r,g,b);<br />    pixels[loc] = c;<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre>Other miscellaneous notes: <br /><ul><li><code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are variables which refer to the size of the sketch</li><li><code>size(x, y, option)</code> will create a sketch of width x and height y, with an optional rendering mode.  The default is <code>JAVA2D</code>, which does high-quality 2D graphics at the expense of speed.  <code>P2D</code> refers to Processing 2D, which has simple graphics and fast pixel operations, so it&#8217;s good if you need to do thousands of shapes.  <code>P3D</code> (Processing 3D renderer) can produce 3D graphics even without the use of a library, and is meant for speed and pixel operations.  <code>OPENGL</code> mixes use of Sun&#8217;s Java for OpenGL library for faster rendering, and Processing&#8217;s APIs for application export (for which the <code>P3D</code> renderer is a simpler solution, if you don&#8217;t want your users to see the whole &#8220;Are you sure you want to trust Sun Microsystems&#8221; dialog).  Finally, <code>size(x, y, PDF, "pdf-name.pdf")</code> will draw to a file rather than a screen.</li><li>You can load images easily in Processing, but it takes a while, so it&#8217;s best to do it only once; i.e. not in <code>draw()</code> but in <code>setup()</code>.<br /></li></ul><br /><br />Sources: <br /><ul><li><a href="http://processing.org/learning/gettingstarted/">Processing: Getting Started</a></li><li><a href="http://processing.org/learning/overview/">Processing: Processing Overview</a></li><li><a href="http://processing.org/learning/objects/">Processing: Object Oriented Programming</a></li><li><a href="http://processing.org/learning/pixels/">Processing: Images &amp; Pixels</a></li></ul></div>
