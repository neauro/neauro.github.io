  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
San Francisco has been great!  I&#8217;ve been spending most of the time trying to get acclimated to my work environment/coworkers, as well as to the passersby here, who all say &#8220;Hi&#8221; at the last possible moment.  I end up turning around hastily and yelling &#8220;Hi!&#8221; to their backs.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve come to an uncomfortable point in my life where I have so many Web 2.0 things that I have no idea what to update, when I feel like updating something.  Most of my SF adventures are detailed on <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/one_new_sf_thing_every_day">my Tumblr</a>, where I strive to do &#8220;one new thing a day.&#8221; My reasoning for not putting that sort of stuff here is that, the stuff I put on Tumblr is more personal?  And I would prefer to reserve this blog for stuff of more professional nature, i.e. learning about programming?  There&#8217;s also a different flavor to how things get shared on Tumblr that I&#8217;m mindful of, for example, if I&#8217;m uploading pictures, all the ones of dessert go to Tumblr, whereas all my super-nicer ones (even if they include family) all go to Flickr, and everything may go indiscriminately to Facebook, etc.<br /><br />I guess on the topic of learning new things, I&#8217;ve been trying to revamp my portfolio website, but been having fun just changing things here and there, searching for the right layout.  I&#8217;m trying to learn Sinatra and it&#8217;s going well, but since my Dreamhost account doesn&#8217;t really support Rails, I may have to do the site in PHP anyway if I want to get it up faster, and try using Heroku if I&#8217;d be okay with getting it up later.</div>

So Journey presents a very different experience in which you are left kind of powerless against the environment you&#8217;re presented with.&#8221;</em></blockquote><br /><br />I haven&#8217;t felt so much hope and excitement for a game in such a long time, much less wanted to purchase a PS3 just to play something.  I&#8217;m so happy that people still make console games that aren&#8217;t just <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-6-most-ominous-trends-in-video-games/">army gamez</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g1t4KGnEj0k/TfpAk-fulHI/AAAAAAAAARI/07_xfbLCW0M/s1600/62660.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g1t4KGnEj0k/TfpAk-fulHI/AAAAAAAAARI/07_xfbLCW0M/s320/62660.jpg" width="143" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-6-most-ominous-trends-in-video-games/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It occurs to me now that I&#8217;ve always been more of a console gamer, but in the past couple years have played games mostly on the PC, most of them either older releases like Bioshock and Portal, or Flash games.  When I was younger games like Sonic the Hedgehog or Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse were fine, but nowadays I really crave story, for a game to make me think something new.  Games are too expensive to risk going beyond gunsight and realistic blood nowadays, I suppose.</div>

(It&#8217;s also meant to allow you to do simple projects without the overhead of all the Java code and learning Java, and is a good gateway programming language.)  Actually, thinking about it now, my first project with Java involving drawing a house, lifting pens and putting them down and changing colors and all.  It was the most frustrating thing ever and I&#8217;m glad I stuck with CS anyway.<br /><br />Little bundles of code for Processing are referred to as &#8220;sketches.&#8221; Here is the code in case you want to create a sketch to make tons of circles for yourself.  (It is also Tutorial 1 on the Processing website.)<br /><br /><pre class="brush:jscript">void setup() {<br />  size(480, 120);<br />  smooth();<br />}<br /><br />void draw() {<br />  if (mousePressed) {<br />    fill(0);<br />  } else {<br />    fill(255);<br />  }<br />  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);<br />}<br /></pre><br />It seems that <code>setup()</code> is called once, when the program starts running; <code>draw()</code> is called constantly, much like an <code>update()</code> function in game programming.  You can also name functions with headers like <code>void mousePressed()</code>, which is a function which would be called every time the mouse is pressed.<br /><br />After you&#8217;re done coding something with Processing, you can Export it into an applet, or an application for Windows, OSX, or Linux.  You can also just easily save frames by calling <code>saveFrame("name-of-output-picture####.png")</code>, where the hash marks will be replaced with a numbered sequence.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s sample code that deals with creating a Car object in Processing:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:jscript">Car myCar1;<br />Car myCar2; // Two objects!<br /><br />void setup() {<br />  size(200,200);<br />  // Parameters go inside the parentheses when the object is constructed.<br />  myCar1 = new Car(color(255,0,0),0,100,2); <br />  myCar2 = new Car(color(0,0,255),0,10,1);<br />}<br /><br />void draw() {<br />  background(255);<br />  myCar1.drive();<br />  myCar1.display();<br />  myCar2.drive();<br />  myCar2.display();<br />}<br /><br />// Even though there are multiple objects, we still only need one class. <br />// No matter how many cookies we make, only one cookie cutter is needed.<br />class Car { <br />  color c;<br />  float xpos;<br />  float ypos;<br />  float xspeed;<br /><br />  // The Constructor is defined with arguments.<br />  Car(color tempC, float tempXpos, float tempYpos, float tempXspeed) { <br />    c = tempC;<br />    xpos = tempXpos;<br />    ypos = tempYpos;<br />    xspeed = tempXspeed;<br />  }<br /><br />  void display() {<br />    stroke(0);<br />    fill(c);<br />    rectMode(CENTER);<br />    rect(xpos,ypos,20,10);<br />  }<br /><br />  void drive() {<br />    xpos = xpos + xspeed;<br />    if (xpos &gt; width) {<br />      xpos = 0;<br />    }<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre><br />And here&#8217;s an example of grabbing samples of color from an image:<br /><pre class="brush:jscript">for (int x = 0; x &lt; img.width; x++) {<br />  for (int y = 0; y &lt; img.height; y++ ) {<br />    // Calculate the 1D pixel location<br />    int loc = x + y*img.width;<br />    // Get the R,G,B values from image<br />    float r = red   (img.pixels[loc]);<br />    float g = green (img.pixels[loc]);<br />    float b = blue  (img.pixels[loc]);<br />    // Change brightness according to the mouse here<br />    float adjustBrightness = ((float) mouseX / width) * 8.0;<br />    r *= adjustBrightness;<br />    g *= adjustBrightness;<br />    b *= adjustBrightness;<br />    // Constrain RGB to between 0-255<br />    r = constrain(r,0,255);<br />    g = constrain(g,0,255);<br />    b = constrain(b,0,255);<br />    // Make a new color and set pixel in the window<br />    color c = color(r,g,b);<br />    pixels[loc] = c;<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre>Other miscellaneous notes: <br /><ul><li><code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are variables which refer to the size of the sketch</li><li><code>size(x, y, option)</code> will create a sketch of width x and height y, with an optional rendering mode.  The default is <code>JAVA2D</code>, which does high-quality 2D graphics at the expense of speed.  <code>P2D</code> refers to Processing 2D, which has simple graphics and fast pixel operations, so it&#8217;s good if you need to do thousands of shapes.  <code>P3D</code> (Processing 3D renderer) can produce 3D graphics even without the use of a library, and is meant for speed and pixel operations.  <code>OPENGL</code> mixes use of Sun&#8217;s Java for OpenGL library for faster rendering, and Processing&#8217;s APIs for application export (for which the <code>P3D</code> renderer is a simpler solution, if you don&#8217;t want your users to see the whole &#8220;Are you sure you want to trust Sun Microsystems&#8221; dialog).  Finally, <code>size(x, y, PDF, "pdf-name.pdf")</code> will draw to a file rather than a screen.</li><li>You can load images easily in Processing, but it takes a while, so it&#8217;s best to do it only once; i.e. not in <code>draw()</code> but in <code>setup()</code>.<br /></li></ul><br /><br />Sources: <br /><ul><li><a href="http://processing.org/learning/gettingstarted/">Processing: Getting Started</a></li><li><a href="http://processing.org/learning/overview/">Processing: Processing Overview</a></li><li><a href="http://processing.org/learning/objects/">Processing: Object Oriented Programming</a></li><li><a href="http://processing.org/learning/pixels/">Processing: Images &amp; Pixels</a></li></ul></div>

I think that everyone ended up doing mobile phone applications, including us.  We designed <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse440/11sp/projects/kibisis/process.html">Kibisis</a>, which is a mobile payment application.  Its main themes are:<br /><br /><ul><li>Connect your credit cards, debit cards, checking and savings accounts, etc. to one application, so that you can consolidate all your methods of payment</li><li>Keep track of your loans and debts to your friends, useful especially for college students who may split rent or loan money to their friends for dinner</li><li>Transfer your money directly, remotely, and securely from your Kibisis account to the Kibisis account of other people, removing the need to stop by banks to cash checks, or to get exact amounts of cash and then meet up to hand it off</li></ul><br />Listed above (and <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse440/11sp/projects/kibisis/process.html">here</a>, again) is the website for our project, which contains all the reports we wrote, which details our testing and design process.  I made the website &#8211; it was a lot of fun.  I really enjoy designing websites, though I concede that I could use more practice and more artsyness.  Probably more practice with Photoshop and Illustrator would help as well.  Every time I try to use Illustrator, I can never figure out how to make even the slightest mark on the canvas.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X2B2h-qoEoQ/Te_0xOLbovI/AAAAAAAAAQc/WowuNtNZacU/s1600/kibisis_process.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="188" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X2B2h-qoEoQ/Te_0xOLbovI/AAAAAAAAAQc/WowuNtNZacU/s320/kibisis_process.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">still, i&#8217;m really proud of this page somehow</td></tr></tbody></table><br />As we were working on this product, <a href="https://squareup.com/">some other similar</a> ones popped up, which was pretty interesting.<br /><br />Kibisis was the best group project I&#8217;ve ever had. :D And definitely a good way to close out undergrad years!</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BnoNmU79S3s/Te6fCLq8juI/AAAAAAAAAPs/51hqo7V6sBs/s1600/Getacross.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BnoNmU79S3s/Te6fCLq8juI/AAAAAAAAAPs/51hqo7V6sBs/s320/Getacross.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Yesterday was our last presentation for Games Capstone.  All in all, it was a pretty good quarter &#8211; I&#8217;ve learned a lot about clientside and serverside game programming using Flixel and Player.IO, as well as how to solve (or even better, avoid dealing with) some of the most annoying problems.<br /><br />You can check <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/instr/cse481d/11sp/games/#">Get Across on Facebook</a>, and see <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/instr/cse481d/11sp/games/#">the other social games</a> on this webpage.<br /><br />First,<br /><br /><h2>An Overview</h2>Get Across is a multiplayer game with tile-based movement.  The objective is to get across (whoa!) a sort of terrain, where different parts of the terrain take more energy to get across, i.e. getting across a mountain takes more energy than getting across a hill, which in turn takes more energy than getting across normal flat ground.  The player can be one of several classes, and each class has its own special abilities: Crafters can get across water by building bridges, Planters can reduce energy usage, Cooks can replenish AP or lure monsters away with Monster Bacon, etc.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QPmFnAiZ3_g/Te-5WmWhIII/AAAAAAAAAQE/fC89efc8d5s/s1600/tutorial1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QPmFnAiZ3_g/Te-5WmWhIII/AAAAAAAAAQE/fC89efc8d5s/s320/tutorial1.jpg" width="319" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">terrain of the first tutorial</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The idea is that you and your friends could work together to solve boards, and be scored on things such as how long it took you to solve the board together, how much energy and other resources you used, etc.  There could be leaderboards for different teams, and you could also make boards on your own and have your friends &#8220;conquer&#8221; them.  Each terrain would be kind of like a puzzle that you would be able to solve in different ways, given your different abilities, and different &#8220;cards&#8221; that you could take into the level, which would have special effects like making mountains explode, or allow players to switch positions with each other, etc.  Like a board game.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Implementation</h2>We &#8211; Ji, Charlie, and myself &#8211; used Flixel, as well as Player.IO for the multiplayer stuff and saving players and states to the database.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Problems</h2>One of them was our thread abortion problem, which arose out of the blue at some point and refused to leave.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oy4_dhDXsrM/Te6gZkim6YI/AAAAAAAAAP0/oMnhzpEFDh8/s1600/the%2Berror%2Bi%2Bhate.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oy4_dhDXsrM/Te6gZkim6YI/AAAAAAAAAP0/oMnhzpEFDh8/s320/the%2Berror%2Bi%2Bhate.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i hate you more than i hate shrimp and scallops</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Eventually, we found <a href="http://playerio.com/forum/multiplayer/cpu-runtime-thread-aborts-t1620">this thread</a> on the Player.IO forums which was made pretty much the day that we started having this problem unbearably, like 90% of the time we started running the game.  I am 90% sure that all of our thread abortions were the cause of the error discussed by Oliver:<br /><br /><blockquote>That error precisely means that one thread was caught using too much cpu, and that it was aborted as a consequence. <strong>We have to ensure that all events are handled swiftly (&lt;100ms), otherwise the server will perform really badly.</strong> I&#8217;ve specified earlier how our new measuring system works: first it uses global time, and then it switches over to thread-specific time, so the other load on the machine *shouldn&#8217;t* make a difference&#8230; unless of course it&#8217;s very high load, in which case all bets are off.&#8221;</blockquote><br />Every player was saved in a &#8220;Quest&#8221; object, which contained that player&#8217;s position on the board, their AP, the amount of resources they had, as well as the state of the board, tiles and monsters and so forth.  Some of these were stored in DatabaseArrays, and some of them were DatabaseObjects in DatabaseArrays&#8230;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QK1LUANMpos/Te6ky6yvolI/AAAAAAAAAxU/EGUMEZ3DhKU/s1600/questobject.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="125" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QK1LUANMpos/Te6ky6yvolI/AAAAAAAAAxU/EGUMEZ3DhKU/s200/questobject.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so much embedded</td></tr></tbody></table><br />One unforeseen problem with the arrays was this weird <a href="http://playerio.com/forum/bigdb-f32/cannot-create-circular-references-inside-database-objects-t1630">circular references error</a>, which happens if you try to create a new object, and then set an array in that object to be the same as another object&#8217;s array.  Due to some weirdness, in order to copy an array over, right now the accepted workaround seems to be to just copy that array element by element&#8230; :/ Which could have contributed to our 100+ ms.  To change this array structure completely would have taken more time than we had, especially since we had already implemented most of the game, but I imagine we could have maybe substituted some of the objects for strings.  For instance, every monster on the board was a DatabaseObject containing an x-position, a y-position, a &#8220;type&#8221; (either weak or strong), and a health variable; instead this could have just been a coded String.<br /><br />Anyway &#8211; leaving Get Across now, I&#8217;m left with a lot of Lessons Learned.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Paper Prototyping and Testing is Essential</h2>The first month or so of our Capstone class was just paper prototyping and testing, which I feel was met with a lot of skepticism on our part.  Paper prototyping for Get Across was pretty easy (if tedious): we just had a grid, and a couple other paper bits to represent mountains, rivers, hills, etc., which we rearranged as necessary.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V4fBD--t-mA/Te6tbnCe-II/AAAAAAAAAP8/KxqyTZKPVhQ/s1600/paper%2Bprototype.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V4fBD--t-mA/Te6tbnCe-II/AAAAAAAAAP8/KxqyTZKPVhQ/s320/paper%2Bprototype.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">paper protyping get across</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Paper prototyping was also a theme of the HCI class that I took this quarter, for obvious reasons: the more you start building something, the harder it is to change.  Paper prototyping helped us learn early which mechanics would work and which wouldn&#8217;t.  For example, one &#8220;social&#8221; aspect of the game would make it so that, of two players playing a map, one player would have to sit on a button and wait for the other player to go through the gate the button opened; but we learned early on that, especially in an asynchronous game, this is an&#8230;inadequate idea.  When someone logs onto a game, they want to be able to do something; if they&#8217;re just sitting and waiting for someone to move, unable to force them to do so, then it&#8217;s regarded as a waste of time.  We eventually made it so that buttons only had to be pressed once for a gate to open permanently, which isn&#8217;t novel, but what we were limited to in time this quarter.<br /><br />Paper prototyping was hard to use for some aspects of our game, however &#8211; for instance, we were thinking that we could use a CityVille-like usage of energy which would come back in time, and in play-testing sessions, since we replenished AP instantly when people lost it, people just didn&#8217;t feel like their AP was rare enough to save.  In retrospect, we could have just made it so that people would wait like 10 seconds or something when they ran out of AP.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Testing and More Testing and More Testing is Also Essential</h2>There were some days when we came to class having a shambled, three-legged version of a game, and it was on those days especially that I didn&#8217;t want to let <em>anyone</em> see the game; but even if all of our functionality wasn&#8217;t implemented yet, we were still able to discover a lot of interesting things that we just wouldn&#8217;t have had the insight to realize on our own.  Here is a sample of the (very long) list of things we gathered during one playtest last month:<br /><ul><li>people will start moving with the mouse before the arrow keys</li><li>people don&#8217;t notice AP diminishing</li><li>&#8220;toggle on and off the bridge is a little confusing&#8221; &#8211; when bridge is selected, instead of putting the yellow square, put an overlay of the bridge?  also, turn off the bridge ability once a bridge is made</li><li>frustrating to wait for AP to come back when you&#8217;ve lost it</li><li>how many clicks do people use to go through the menu, and as they play?  try and minimize number of clicks</li><li>and so on</li></ul><br /><br /><h2>Having a Schedule Would Have Probably Made Our Lives Easier</h2>The way that we worked on Get Across was a little haphazardly &#8211; we pushed out the features that we wanted to, versus the ones we probably should have worked on, which made it so that our Facebook integration was close to nothing.  Which brings me to the next point:<br /><br /><br /><h2>If It&#8217;s Supposed to be a Facebook Game, Build It on Facebook From the Very Beginning!</h2>It seems obvious, but this particular Capstone advised this course very strongly: release on Newgrounds, then on Kongregate (which has a larger populace), then on Facebook.  In the end, we only did Kongregate and Facebook (since Player.IO supports these two, and not Newgrounds), but not focusing on Facebook integration from the very beginning (allowing you to see your friends, or to send invitations to them immediately) made Get Across&#8217;s Facebook release very weak.<br /><br /><br /><br />And those are the writing-worthy ones that I can think of.  Simple, yet effective lessons.  In the end, working with Player.IO was fun and it definitely served its purpose, and the only thing keeping it from working perfectly for us was the learning curve.<br /><br />Knowing slightly more than I did before this game, and tons more than I know than when I worked with Jimmy and Leilani to put together <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/02/game-bonding-time.html">Bonding Time</a>, I am really excited to start my next game project. :D Just gotta think about what it will be.</div>

There were a ton of parts that were so awkward it was painful to watch (in a good way, I suppose).  I didn&#8217;t mind to much while watching it, but afterward, talking about the story with Jimmy and Mari on the way home, it seemed to us that there was still a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Jimmy for one is a huge proponent of <a href="http://www.imyjimmy.com/post/3420065648/originality-vs-focus">focus in stories</a>, and thinks that every movie should have an <strong>armature</strong>, which is essentially &#8220;the moral of the story.&#8221; The armature for The Godfather, for example, is that &#8220;Your family defines you.&#8221;<br /><br />Throughout the entirety of Bridesmaids, the main character, Annie, appears to struggle with her negative outlook and lack self-confidence.  She&#8217;s in a relationship with a clearly douche-y guy who doesn&#8217;t care about her, she struggles with another character who appears to be stealing her best friend away, she ends up pushing away the people who <em>do</em> care about her because of her own pessimism.  Things begin to look up for her when she does decide to think positively, which occurs after her last, enormous mad outburst, and (apparently) due to one of her other &#8220;friends&#8221; tackling Annie on the couch and slapping her until Annie fought for herself.<br /><br />If you&#8217;ve been depressed and thinking negatively for months, Jimmy pointed out, thinking positively doesn&#8217;t come easily.  It takes a little more than a fat woman to beat you up on your furniture to make you think positively.<br /><br />And once she does think positively, the solutions to all her problems just fell into her lap.  Sure, she attempted and seemed to fail at apologizing to her love interest after wronging him &#8211; but that&#8217;s only a small step out of the comfort zone that she&#8217;s been hissing herself into the entire movie.  It&#8217;s true that she never had to overcome anything greater than herself for the entire movie, but if doing so was so easy, why didn&#8217;t it just happen fifteen minutes in?<br /><br />If a good movie should have focus, if every scene of it should mean something (much like how every sentence should mean something in <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/06/her-will-short-story-for-au-iii-legacy.html">a short story</a>), and a big theme, then this movie fell something short of &#8220;good.&#8221; There seemed to be a lot of things that didn&#8217;t really mean anything &#8211; for instance, why was Annie a baker?  The majority of the things that she did in that movie were completely unrelated to baking, and she only ever baked anything in two scenes.  The first time that she baked something, it was after she met her love interest, and because he admitted he was a neighbor, I thought: Would she give it to her love interest?  But no: she just looked at it, then ate it.<br /><br />What is that supposed to mean?  Does she bake to try and calm herself?  If so, why doesn&#8217;t she do it the other times that she panics during the movie?  Was she thinking about giving it to the love interest, and then was too afraid to do so?<br /><br />Why was it important for Annie to be a baker?  Was it just so that she could have a failed start-up, to show that she had ambition but had been broken by her failure?  If so, couldn&#8217;t there have been a better way to do this, without giving her a completely superfluous label as &#8220;baker&#8221;?  Or, if she definitely is a baker, why wouldn&#8217;t this show through in other aspects of her life?  She doesn&#8217;t have recipe books.  She doesn&#8217;t comment about the food that she eats.  She doesn&#8217;t appear to have anything super baker-y in her room, which in a few shots is nice and elegant but completely lacking in description of the type of character that she is.  People&#8217;s rooms can be the greatest indicator of what type of person they are &#8211; clean, messy, cluttered &#8211; my roommate&#8217;s typography decorations and shelves of comic books speak differently than my wall of folded-up paper chopstick-covers and small shelve stuffed with PS2 games.  Mariko has a wire shelf of animu and Sakuracon badges.  Jimmy has a triplet of monitors for his computer, Molly&#8217;s desk and windowsill is lined with classics and books about healthy eating.<br /><br />As Jimmy texted, a couple minutes ago: <em>Never have a batman movie that can also be a superman movie.  Character must be intrinsic to plot.  Annie could&#8217;ve been anything.</em><br /><br />Which means, really, that she wasn&#8217;t anything.<br /><br />There were a lot of other unnecessary parts &#8211; Annie&#8217;s mother maybe finding a new partner at the end, two of the bridesmaids becoming completely irrelevant at the end of the movie, so on.  Anyway, it&#8217;s a funny movie.</div>

Apparently a ton of people submitted short stories for this quarter&#8217;s &#8220;Legacy&#8221; theme, and most of those stories were right on the border of 3,000 words.  As AU&#8217;s size is apparently limited by how many pages the editors can physically staple together, they could only accept 6 submissions.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AWre2xlzwP4/Te2Z3EgpgOI/AAAAAAAAAPk/B4I-P3ztHX4/s1600/au_iii_cover.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AWre2xlzwP4/Te2Z3EgpgOI/AAAAAAAAAPk/B4I-P3ztHX4/s320/au_iii_cover.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">cover by katherine tung, once more</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My submission is a short story titled <em>Her Will</em>, and you can find <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/post/6186670471/her-will">the full thing here</a>.<br /><br />When I heard about the theme, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy">searched Wikipedia</a> and came to the conclusion that something playing off an inheritance or will would be a good idea.  I also thought that it might be neat if a &#8220;will&#8221; were more literal &#8211; that is, that someone who died in some alternate universe would be able to possess some person to carry out a last task.  Eventually this idea was trashed, but, meh.  I may come back to it again.<br /><br />I think that it&#8217;s fair to say I&#8217;ve never written short stories before AU; I just never really had the idea for it, nor the urge.  I always found it hard to squeeze all my ideas into one short story.  But I&#8217;ve discovered that writing short stories are surprisingly, uniquely fun &#8211; there&#8217;s something about it that&#8217;s almost like design.  There has to be a meaning to every word, every sentence.  For this story, I went beginning to end multiple times trying to cut out everything I couldn&#8217;t immediately justify, and strengthening everything else that was left.  Though I would call the story far from perfect (when does any story ever reach that point?), even now I can&#8217;t think of one sentence that I would feel comfortable removing.  I feared that some of the sentences would start to sound blunt and lifeless, but hopefully that&#8217;s not the case in the final draft.<br /><br />I&#8217;m going to miss AU!  Hopefully it will be taken up by new people next year, and I&#8217;ll be able to contribute since I&#8217;ll still be a UW (Master&#8217;s) student.</div>

Not so hard, as Charlie had already implemented the store-type setup, and I really just needed to change a couple variables here and there and add the right checks to make sure the avatars loaded properly.  The hardest thing was testing each little avatar and making sure that the frames were all separated &#8211; if the images on the frames are too close together, then you can see bits of them leaking onto other frames of an animation.  There&#8217;s probably a smarter way to figure out where the delineation is in Flixel sprite animations, but I haven&#8217;t been able to find it yet.<br /><br />Hopefully this will make our Facebook release even just a little bit more fun/appealing.  FB release will happen at the latest this Thursday, if another team-member hasn&#8217;t already pushed it.  Player.IO was apparently pretty easy to hook up to Facebook if you subscribe to Sitebox, which is a relief; I&#8217;m planning to get more details later on how exactly Charlie did it.</div>

Awesome, they are so cute! I forgot that you draw also. Maybe I&#39;ll have to get you to do the art on one of my games sometime. :)</div>
