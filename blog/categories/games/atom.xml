<p>I can&rsquo;t really help being the type of person who would be totally satisfied for hours finding stuff to dig up and feed to digital creatures. That you get to do this in <a href="http://www.mightanddelight.com/index.php?page=shelter">Shelter</a> while waddling around as a squat creature, followed by five other smaller squat creatures, is an unexpectedly satisfying plus.</p>

<p>In Shelter, you play the role of a mother badger tasked with foraging and protecting five little badger babbus. Shelter is So Pretty, though the lack of contrast was occasionally hard on my eyes, and confused my gameplay. For example, since you are cued to hungry babbus by looking at which one is less saturated than the others, I think I ended up overfeeding the babbu with a pattern that consistently made it look pale/hungry, even when it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>[spoilers ahead]</p>

<p>I was determined to bring all my babbus through the game, but unfortunately lost one to the river, one to fire, and one to the hawk at the end. I wasn&rsquo;t too surprised by the game&rsquo;s bitterwsweet ending, but wish it had been performed differently — for one thing, I kept getting lost running back and forth between those final grasses — would it have been possible to do something like desaturate the direction from which you&rsquo;d come, to make the forest endgame more obvious and maybe even ~paradisical~?</p>

<p>It was also a shame to be picked off &ldquo;against my will&rdquo; at the end — thinking about it now, it would have been cool to maybe hear a babbu shriek, and then look back to see that a hawk is struggling to carry it away. By the end of the game, the babbus are pretty heavy after all — maybe capable of giving a good thrash — and at that point you could make the choice to go back and try to fight the bird off, at which point it gives you a couple good swipes and then lifts you away to continue the circle of life.</p>

<p class="caption">good luck my sweets</p>


<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to Shelter 2, mostly because you&rsquo;ll be able to run without fear of leaving babbus behind to fend for themselves. Also, <em>those little mewling noises in the trailer</em>.</p>

<p class="caption">a screenshot of Monument Valley</p>


<p>I played <a href="http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/">Monument Valley</a> carefully, slowly, with headphones, trying to savor it. It&rsquo;s tough with puzzle games, because if something takes you a little more effort than your flow state allows, your vision narrows, and it&rsquo;s tough to think about anything except stuff like <em>HOW DO I GET THROUGH THAT DOOR AUAUUGHHH</em></p>

<p>In Monument Valley, you lead (are?) Ida, a &ldquo;silent princess,&rdquo; through a geometrically implausible landscape. The game has very nice UI built in to facilitate you taking screenshots, which is a good feature for getting the word out. It&rsquo;s fairly innocuous, since you <em>do</em> start to feel like you want to share where you&rsquo;ve been in the game, even if it isn&rsquo;t the sort of thing used for making unique creations.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/monument2.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Monument Valley"/></p>

<p class="caption">here's another screenshot, because i took a lot of them and consider them all gorg</p>


<p>The screenshot feature has the added benefit of guiding your player into how they should feel about the game too. <em>This scene is pretty. Appreciate it!</em> Emails sent with screenshots are loaded with the message &ldquo;Wish you were here,&rdquo; which is pretty cute.</p>

<p>My favorite bits (with spoilers):</p>

<ul>
<li>The title card &ldquo;flavors,&rdquo; especially IN WHICH A THRONE LIES VACANT and IN WHICH THERE IS NOBODY LEFT TO FORGIVE US. These are the game&rsquo;s last-subtle aspects, and though I can&rsquo;t say with any specificity what they refer to (and would have preferred if I could), I like the poetry of them, and their ominousness.</li>
<li>Meeting your Yellow Block Friend. I loved how Ida would touch them when they were standing together. And I also loved watching them sink under the ocean, only to return later during the descent — so good! Their plodding after you until totally overtaken by watery vectors was pleasantly heartbreaking.</li>
<li>The whole &ldquo;music box&rdquo; level, as well as the levels in general where you start without knowing where Ida is. It makes the geometry of the game — and Ida&rsquo;s navigation through it — a little more &ldquo;impossible.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>The trailer was gorgeous and I&rsquo;m a sucker for both folklore and foxes, so I played <a href="http://neveralonegame.com/">Never Alone</a> this weekend. I started on my own and, after getting trapped in an area where character AI wasn&rsquo;t quite cutting it (and kept dropping me into an icy demise), I set up a controller so I could play with a human. (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1l21zb/playing_with_a_ps3_controller_on_pc_a_setup_guide">It&rsquo;s pretty easy, by the way!</a>)</p>

<p>It turned out to be fortunate trouble because the game is much more fun with someone else, though I admit that this could also be because I rarely play multi-player games nowadays and hugely prefer them to be cooperative when I do. The atmosphere and Iñupiaq narration were fantastic, and I loved the subtlety of certain details, such as the little halo of light that emerged from the fox&rsquo;s head whenever a spirit was near. Certain things didn&rsquo;t quite make sense — why do the spirits of the aurora fly away with you? If it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re doing something &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; what is that bad thing you&rsquo;re doing? — but it helps contributes to the surrealism that surrounds old stories.</p>

<p>I only wish the game was longer than the three hours it took us to complete it. Hopefully it&rsquo;s successful enough to warrant the creation of further chapters, and inspires others to find new ways to share their cultural stories as well. I know I&rsquo;d love to see a game with the Filipino pantheon, despite (or even because) of its incredible diversity and tension with Christianity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/smallworld1.jpg" alt="Picture of Smallworld board, with 'Dragon Master Elves' at the front"/></p>

<p class="caption">dragon master elves?!</p>


<p>Last Friday we hit up a small pub table and inconspicuously played J&rsquo;s copy of Small World, <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/">&ldquo;the fun, zany, light-hearted civilization board game!&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote>Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci™, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs and even humans; who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth. (<a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>This game has some disturbing colonialization themes aside; there are even pre-existing people in some territorites that you must conquer to inhabit that territory. Even so, I enjoyed this game so much that I eyed it hungrily at Card Kingdom after our party dispersed. The delicious flavor! The cool (albeit almost entirely white) characters! I love that the game naturally becomes different each time as you mix &ldquo;race powers&rdquo; and &ldquo;special powers;&rdquo; I love that the flavor of the game itself, its pictures and words, are delicious and meaningful and fly off the cardboard and became us — as in the terrifying era of K&rsquo;s Pillaging Skeletons, uprooting their femurs from mountain and farmland and laying waste across nests of Flying Trolls and Berserk Humans, resting for only a moment before rising again in greater number. <em>What</em>.</p>

<p>One weak part of the game, however, are the victory points. They are called gold; if you have the most of them at the end of the game, You Win. Flavor-wise, I don&rsquo;t feel like they entirely fit — when, during all this conquest, does gold arbitrary rise from the depths? — and there&rsquo;s also not much that you can do with them, other than occasionally exchange them to get the race you want. During the &ldquo;conquest&rdquo; phase, they are useless. What if instead you could use them to do something like increase your number of troops, and gamble to try and get more land? What if you needed to pay coins in order to roll for reinforcement, an action that is otherwise totally free and something you usually want to do? It seems like a missed opportunity for <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2010/03/flydrill-and-logistical-gameplay.html">logistical gameplay</a>, and allowing players the pleasure of &ldquo;not simply doing something, but doing it well — optimizing it to perfection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A also noted that, though he felt he had made the right &ldquo;decisions,&rdquo; he still placed last in our group of four, and didn&rsquo;t grasp how he could have played the game better. He didn&rsquo;t feel that he had &ldquo;gained experience&rdquo; and learned how to play the game any better. Though I can&rsquo;t find it now, it reminds me of what I have read once regarding <a href="http://spryfox.com/our-games/tripletown/">Triple Town</a>, and how it seems to be a simple game until you make a mistake — <em>and then you get it</em>, you get what the game is about, you feel excited to give it another go.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/smallworld2.jpg" alt="Picture of Smallworld board, with a ton of stuff on it"/></p>

<p class="caption">smallworld board, getting all exciting as stuff accumulates</p>


<p>I hope to try out the expansions sometime, though the use of &ldquo;gypsy&rdquo; as a race in one of them is disconcerting, and reminds me of how uncomfortable the overall theme is.</p>

<p><em>Thomas Was Alone</em> was super cute, if more ambiguous than I personally like. I liked the personality given to all the different shapes, though their common heroism and conceit got a little old as the game went on, which was why Laura&rsquo;s cynicism made her my favorite (though I felt compelled inexlicably to keep calling her &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo;). I loved that the levels were tilted, the play of light, the strange colors. (Though I wonder if any colorblind users had a hard time playing?)</p>

<p>One thing I think the game could have been improved was the game&rsquo;s sense of progression; though numbers ticked up each level, after a while they became meaningless, and now that the game is finished I&rsquo;m not totally sure what I would use them for. The introduction of each of the colored shapes, Thomas&rsquo;s &ldquo;death,&rdquo; and the era of the gray shapes seemed to be the largest movements in the story, and though each was accompanied with a fun snippet of &ldquo;The AIs are gaining sentience!&rdquo; flavor I didn&rsquo;t really have a sense that things were reaching their end until the end came suddenly to meet me. Some levels seemed like little &ldquo;drabbles&rdquo; and experiments, which I completed without much more effort than would take for me to click a cow in Farmville, and it would have been cool to see something else related to AIs breaking their previous ways of being. Breaking through the borders of levels — intentionally disobeying orders — something to add to the flavor text.</p>

<p>I played <em>Thomas Was Alone</em> on a projector and if you have the opportunity to do so yourself I recommend it. All those rectangles are like way better when they&rsquo;re as big as your face.</p>
