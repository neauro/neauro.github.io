Valente. Now she weaves a lyrically erotic spell of a place where the grotesque and the beautiful reside and the passport to our most secret fantasies begins with a stranger’s kiss.… <br /><br />Between life and death, dreaming and waking, at the train stop beyond the end of the world is the city of Palimpsest. To get there is a miracle, a mystery, a gift, and a curse—a voyage permitted only to those who’ve always believed there’s another world than the one that meets the eye. Those fated to make the passage are marked forever by a map of that wondrous city tattooed on their flesh after a single orgasmic night. To this kingdom of ghost trains, lion-priests, living kanji, and cream-filled canals come four travelers: Oleg, a New York locksmith; the beekeeper November; Ludovico, a binder of rare books; and a young Japanese woman named Sei. They’ve each lost something important—a wife, a lover, a sister, a direction in life—and what they will find in Palimpsest is more than they could ever imagine.</i></blockquote><br />Being terribly hungry for more of Valente&#8217;s writing after reading <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2013/05/deathless-catherynne-valente.html"><em>Deathless</em></a>, I chose <em>Palimpsest</em> to read next due to its focus on a city, a subject I have a weakness for ever since reading China Miéville.<br /><br />All I really have to say about this book is <em>wow</em>. My feedback for it is similar to anything I had to babble about <em>Deathless</em> — excellent, poetic, gorgeous. Like <em>Deathless</em>, though the plot was a little flimsy, I didn&#8217;t mind that much; whereas <em>Deathless</em> was suspended in a fairytale haze that made everything easy to digest, <em>Palimpsest</em> had all the (appropriate) tones of a dreamland, in which things don&#8217;t make utter sense but are all imbued with truth and urgency.<br /><br />Something else I appreciated about this book in particular was the character Amaya Sei. Though I&#8217;m not Japanese myself, I felt that the treatment of Sei as a character was great; she didn&#8217;t sink into stereotypes, she stood up on her own, and overall she was allowed to be a <em>person</em> rather than a caricature. It was also refreshing to read a story with such a variety of characters, diverse unabashedly and without slowing down to explain things: this person is mixed, this person is gay, and so on.<br /><br /><em>Palimpsest</em> was fantastic.</div>

But Koschei has never before been seen through the eyes of Catherynne Valente, whose modernized and transformed take on the legend brings the action to modern times, spanning many of the great developments of Russian history in the twentieth century.<br /><br />Deathless, however, is no dry, historical tome: it lights up like fire as the young Marya Morevna transforms from a clever child of the revolution, to Koschei’s beautiful bride, to his eventual undoing. Along the way there are Stalinist house elves, magical quests, secrecy and bureaucracy, and games of lust and power. All told, Deathless is a collision of magical history and actual history, of revolution and mythology, of love and death, which will bring Russian myth back to life in a stunning new incarnation.</em></blockquote><br /><em>I can&#8217;t even believe that I&#8217;ve never read anything by Catherynne Valente before.</em> Her writing is so gorgeous that I found myself struggling to slow down, to digest every word. True to the reviews on the inside cover, <em>Deathless</em> reads like modern fairytale, and for that reason even the stranger things in the book — Marya&#8217;s scars like tiger stripes, her hair thick as snakes, her &#8220;twelve mothers&#8221; you never quite meet, the palaces she walks of twitching skin — sink and seep in easily, where in a less poetic book they might have instead made me wince. Similarly, things that might have bothered me in other books, I was fine with here. Years transpire believably in paragraphs. We leave Marya and return months later once she has already made friends we don&#8217;t know, which she soon loses and spends the rest of the book crying for. Totally cool with it.<br /><br />I loved Valente&#8217;s use of fairytale-esque repetition, the minimalist exposition and description that was just <em>barely</em> there. It was just the right amount of description to push you off the edge of things, and let the rest of you fly away into a sort of landscape that your own mind painted into her sketches.<br /><br />It occurs to me that this makes it sound as if you have to put a lot of effort into understanding things, but this isn&#8217;t quite the case. Reading Valente&#8217;s writing is like reading Tarot cards. You see the images — fill your mind with them — and all the intricacies come floating up on their own.<br /><br />Does that make sense either? To be honest, there&#8217;s no description I have that can do justice; all I can say is that after reading this book I&#8217;ve become a seriose fan, and have already started for everything else she&#8217;s written.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Garden stuff has been progressing without me writing much about it because recently I am lucky if I can manage to wake up early enough or stay up long enough at home to water anything, much less take photos of it and muse upon its growth. Suffice to say that at the start of spring I went crazy over some on-sale seeds and attempted to plant some in seed starter pots.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HbVoI1I65dc/UZkzqoJegjI/AAAAAAAADmA/xv4ionrdSvE/s1600/pots.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HbVoI1I65dc/UZkzqoJegjI/AAAAAAAADmA/xv4ionrdSvE/s640/pots.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">march pots</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Dragon&#8217;s Tongue Wax Beans in particular looked super cool and exciting and got off to a great start indoors…<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bxXJjsUTwl8/UZk0YNfGEzI/AAAAAAAADmI/c6o1a7VLsEg/s1600/b20cad109e0611e2977522000a9f308b_6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bxXJjsUTwl8/UZk0YNfGEzI/AAAAAAAADmI/c6o1a7VLsEg/s1600/b20cad109e0611e2977522000a9f308b_6.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">lil things</td></tr></tbody></table><br />…but when I transplanted them outside, they didn&#8217;t last two weeks. Maybe I didn&#8217;t harden them off enough? Maybe, like swiss chard, they&#8217;re too delicate to withstand transplanting? When I transplanted them I also planted some new beans, and these happen to be doing really well. Unlike the indoor starts, they have very deep green leaves and thick stems.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BWMd4Y28qBI/UZk0e1u9oNI/AAAAAAAADmQ/0fb0RZ25HP0/s1600/beans.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BWMd4Y28qBI/UZk0e1u9oNI/AAAAAAAADmQ/0fb0RZ25HP0/s640/beans.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">transplants in the back, new beans in the front</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My other surprise is the success of my radishes, which I planted outdoors in March alongside some arugula and swiss chard. Look, they&#8217;re doing it! They&#8217;re really growing!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wlw-8ULdxk0/UZk0mRvdBQI/AAAAAAAADmY/sssd_-6eP5M/s1600/radish.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wlw-8ULdxk0/UZk0mRvdBQI/AAAAAAAADmY/sssd_-6eP5M/s640/radish.jpg" width="480" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">radishes</td></tr></tbody></table><br />They&#8217;re probably the most attractive-looking edible thing I&#8217;ve grown this far, especially since the spinach and swiss chard I started growing before last winter tasted pretty mediocre. My mistake was not staggering out their sowing, however, so I pretty much just have this batch and that&#8217;s it for now.<br /><br />Speaking of the spinach, as soon as the heat started getting up to around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, they started sending up flowers. The plants rise up over my knee now, and their stalks are as thick as my fingers, and it&#8217;s hard to believe that they used to be just little seeds.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nrNtX57556s/UZk01kBXMTI/AAAAAAAADmg/isuH3F_SXMk/s1600/spinach.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nrNtX57556s/UZk01kBXMTI/AAAAAAAADmg/isuH3F_SXMk/s640/spinach.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">biiig spinaches</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My lime tree has really perked up now that the weather has gotten better, though has still suffered from leaves that are pale green and strangely droopy and bendy. They feel almost elastic. Some internet research has uncovered that I, in my passion to not drown it, I may be <em>under watering</em> it. Since being given a couple thorough soaks, the leaves indeed seem a little stiffer and greener. I&#8217;ve also repotted it into something larger and more sturdy than its initial black pot. No flowers or fruit yet, probably because it&#8217;s been stressed and dehydrated for the better part of its life with me.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2K9oGih_FtA/UZk5k9YELFI/AAAAAAAADm8/kUQGMmKcBW4/s1600/lime.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2K9oGih_FtA/UZk5k9YELFI/AAAAAAAADm8/kUQGMmKcBW4/s640/lime.jpg" width="424" /></a></div><br /><br />Speaking of stressed and dehydrated, before the winter started Andou and I received a very impressive-looking 30 year old jade tree&#8230;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FBtg2WrZ7_0/UZk4kr_GXTI/AAAAAAAADmw/pxyd6OAy_aQ/s1600/JADE.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FBtg2WrZ7_0/UZk4kr_GXTI/AAAAAAAADmw/pxyd6OAy_aQ/s640/JADE.jpg" width="424" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">jade tree on the sunniest part of our house, the laundry room</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was very concerned about killing it, especially since, despite my diligent watering, its leaves began to fall off in gooey yellow curls. Some internet research has uncovered that I, in my passion to not kill it, I was probably <em>over watering</em> it. I&#8217;ve since then toned down and the tree seems okay on its new perch over the dryer. One branch even bloomed little white blossoms! Whoa!<br /><br />My air plants from last year are doing well. In the picture below, the top plant had one pup that is now fairly large, and the bottom actually had two pups, so it&#8217;s getting to be a handful.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ePFiQPKUfGE/UZk6H_Nc0ZI/AAAAAAAADnM/iV_Tzcv5RKk/s1600/DSC_0008.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ePFiQPKUfGE/UZk6H_Nc0ZI/AAAAAAAADnM/iV_Tzcv5RKk/s640/DSC_0008.jpg" width="480" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">spot the pups!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It&#8217;s been about a year since <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/tillandsia-pups.html">I got them at the UW Street Fair</a>, and when the fair rolled around again this weekend I was excited to pick up more! Four more, in fact. I was excited to get ones with weirder tentacle shapes, and then also picked up two teensy blooming ones, one of which already looks like it&#8217;s growing a pup. The two little ones are already a year old and were blooming already, so it makes me a little bewildered about why my plants from last year are not blooming. Maybe I should invest in some fertilizer.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K9mnSDnlg8c/UZk62g87ozI/AAAAAAAADnY/gdU6fXWDE2k/s1600/new+tillandsia.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K9mnSDnlg8c/UZk62g87ozI/AAAAAAAADnY/gdU6fXWDE2k/s640/new+tillandsia.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">spot the pup!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Speaking of plants retrieved at fairs, my sedums are doing okay. The iceplant-looking one is faring the best of all of them. I&#8217;ve moved three of them to a little pot I bought at Daiso and tried to give them succulent soil to see if they would do any better than in normal potting soil, but thus far I don&#8217;t observe any difference.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gxWzNb7CxSk/UZk8esDbULI/AAAAAAAADno/0tJ7GN8_R44/s1600/sedum.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gxWzNb7CxSk/UZk8esDbULI/AAAAAAAADno/0tJ7GN8_R44/s640/sedum.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sedums in a long pot</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Speaking of succulent soil, the reason why I had some is because I got another succulent! I saw it on sale at the hardware store and couldn&#8217;t resist. Donkey/burro tail plants are so neat-looking. Some of the little bean-leaves had detached and fallen between into the dirt inside the pot, so I took them out and placed them in their own pots to see if they might grow into new plants.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NY0YtOmu5JE/UZk8k9hneQI/AAAAAAAADnw/mxgqWYJAGFE/s1600/succulent+tail.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NY0YtOmu5JE/UZk8k9hneQI/AAAAAAAADnw/mxgqWYJAGFE/s640/succulent+tail.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">burro tail on the dryer</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And that&#8217;s (almost) all of what I have growing.</div>

She raised the banner of it with every missing umbrella (or broken umbrella, on a blustering day), with every bout of apprehension (during speeches, but especially first dates), with every misremembered promise (easily shucked off on days when the wind blew and bit the bones).</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Life isn’t kind. She did these things to others, but she did them for me. I couldn’t know life, so this is how she showed it to me. Missed buses, muddy white dresses, crumpled fenders, ruptured skin. Withered ardor, drifted friendships, secrets and promises slipped from mouth and mind. This is how I knew I wasn’t missing anything.

We welcomed the newcomers who traded their scars for a view of my face, my limbs, all approximated from the bodies of the handful that attended the wake. At night I liked to show them the procession of comets and meteorites, all swathed with wishes. They always cried to see their own hopes racing away from them, their old fuzzy future becoming the stone past. I have never cried, but I comfort them the way I’ve seen comforting happen. Death is kind, so you might as well be kind.</div><hr /><div style="font-size: 90%;">Prompt:&nbsp;<i>&#8220;Life isn&#8217;t kind,&#8221; my mother would always say, &#8220;so why should you be?&#8221;</i>&nbsp;Use this line as inspiration for a short story or poem.</div></div>

Luckily, we discovered an all-purpose primer at an Ace Hardware which a woman added a gray hue to for us, so that we could achieve the dark black we wanted.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4YYWpCHZBDA/UXnxP06TofI/AAAAAAAADiM/pPOSuj5ro00/s1600/DSC_0211.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4YYWpCHZBDA/UXnxP06TofI/AAAAAAAADiM/pPOSuj5ro00/s640/DSC_0211.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">primer time</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It took a couple months to construct, and about a week to paint, and afterward Andou edged out the fingers with silver to give it a metallic look.<br /><br />As for the dress…I had this idea that I would eyeball the entire thing, and this would just <em>not work</em> for the lovely back that this costume has. I ended up trying to eyeball the dress twice before resigning myself to crawling the Internet for patterns. Luckily, I found <a href="http://www.briansews.com/2011/07/how-to-y-back-tank-top.html">a really great tutorial</a> on how to make a &#8220;racerback&#8221; tank top, and from there it was pretty easy! (Though still time-consuming.)<br /><br />The collar was made out of a piece of foam, which we covered with black fabric and white felt and secured in the back with a plate of cardboard and some screws. (Andou&#8217;s touch, which I think is awesome.)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gIuRrFlF6ag/UXnx6IU-0iI/AAAAAAAADiY/lhYJp1yAoPs/s1600/smaller.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="478" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gIuRrFlF6ag/UXnx6IU-0iI/AAAAAAAADiY/lhYJp1yAoPs/s640/smaller.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />The tail was the thing that got thrown under the bus this time, as the deadline neared: that was fashioned somewhat crudely from leftover foam covered in masking tape, painted over in black, and sewn to the back of my biking shorts. The tape slowly unraveled throughout Con, but luckily neither it (or the arms!) broke apart entirely, despite my panicking throughout the weekend.<br /><br />Without further ado, here are photos from my group&#8217;s photoshoot, all taken by the super-talented <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jaymee.masui">Jaymee Masui</a>!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J23HKRd1DIA/UXn1baZL49I/AAAAAAAADjA/CuYZeLMOmsE/s1600/27155_513352652061010_2061205090_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="472" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J23HKRd1DIA/UXn1baZL49I/AAAAAAAADjA/CuYZeLMOmsE/s640/27155_513352652061010_2061205090_n.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">our whole group!</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SGkmfLshdKM/UXn1fuZAX6I/AAAAAAAADjI/3o_KKVMh9rE/s1600/534920_513352595394349_1464377463_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="382" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SGkmfLshdKM/UXn1fuZAX6I/AAAAAAAADjI/3o_KKVMh9rE/s640/534920_513352595394349_1464377463_n.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">&#8220;group hug&#8221;</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-joZwQ1T968Q/UXn1jVyFLOI/AAAAAAAADjQ/UknoWtU7g0A/s1600/733802_513352732061002_890250777_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-joZwQ1T968Q/UXn1jVyFLOI/AAAAAAAADjQ/UknoWtU7g0A/s640/733802_513352732061002_890250777_n.jpg" width="428" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">strength &amp; gold saw, who i am told have a special relationship</td></tr></tbody></table><br />More group photos can be seen at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.513352428727699.1073741826.475899655806310&amp;type=1">Kimidori Cosplay</a>.

Here&#8217;s to many years ahead. ^___^<br /><br />Fun fact: the arms were so heavy that I actually gained non-negligible muscle mass over the course of the weekend…haha.

Haha, Andou looks so awesome there with his&#8230; *ahem* handiwork. ;)<br /><br />And you look awesome too, of course! Great choice - I&#39;m impressed at how you pulled it off. :)</div>

(What is it like to love someone and then see their body thrown into the back of a garbage truck? <em>Oh God</em>)<br /><br />It’s a story that I would be surprised to find in the US, because despite the fact that the title alludes to the wolf-shapeshifting children, the story is just as much about their mother, Hana, and her struggles to raise the children, aided only by her dead partner’s dwindling savings. She learns about natural birth to avoid going to hospitals; she fights off health inspectors; at some point her daughter accidentally ingests detergent and there’s an amusing scene of her rushing off into the night and then glancing desperately back and forth between a children’s hospital and a pet clinic.<br /><br />Though Hana misses her partner, at no point does she ever really find a replacement for him, or need another man at all. Even when she moves into the countryside, she receives assistance from the entire community there (though there is vaguely tsundere old man involved). Though her partner was a wolfman and is the reason why her children are also partially wolves, he just isn’t a part of the equation after he leaves. It sounds simple, but it’s such a relief that there are stories out there about women persevering, doing their own thing against all odds, and ultimately finding a place where they (and their children) can just be themselves.<br /><br />It’s also just a relief to see a woman who isn’t vilified for being a single mother, who isn’t ultimately viewed as lesser and unwhole for her lack of a man, who loses him and continues to move on with her life. Despite what much media would have you believe, without men, women keep existing and struggling towards their own goals.<br /><br />It&#8217;s true that Hana’s motivations center almost entirely on the health of her children, which on its own isn’t terribly stereotype-breaking, but I appreciated how Hana didn’t lose her personality to become a faceless machine of a mother figure, a character wholly defined by her offspring’s emotions. Her bright attitude could have been unbelievable, but was acceptable to me because it is something established as a defining trait: &#8220;Even at my father’s funeral I laughed.&#8221; And even so, it doesn’t mean she’s perfect: she often admits her ignorance (and remedies it thoroughly researching all her problems), she cries, she bandages her fingers, she panics, and rubs her back when it aches. You also get a glimpse of Hana&#8217;s life as it was before motherhood, and a little &#8220;after,&#8221; once her children have embarked <br /><br />And now that all of that is said — though <em>Wolf Children</em> impressed me with its focus on Hana as a single mother, after talking about this movie with Heather, I learned that the &#8220;virtuous mother&#8221; is actually a trope not uncommon in Eastern narratives. I haven&#8217;t noticed it much, but will definitely be keeping an eye on it from now on.</div>

I enjoyed it I guess. I play so few first-person shooters that I might as well go for the newest, most-polished one if I’m going to play anything while waiting (wistfully) for the next Metroid Prime. I have a penchant for headshots that seems to surprise people, but it is faster and cleaner and ultimately less squicky than melee in this game, which consists of scooping flesh from the faces of your opponents with a rotating hook-thingy. I saw the pink-red eye sockets of my first victim and felt ill and decided to go guns from then on, despite my usual powerful desire to greedily hoard any item I acquire in a game, including ammo.<br /><br /><br /><h2>2.</h2>The racism was also squicky. People seem to be very happy to engage in racism when it’s not real life, and defend its use as an edgy plot device. Ultimately I&#8217;m just exhausted by it, exhausted by black people apologizing to you over sudsy puddles, exhausted by Chinese people shouting for mercy in pidgin English before being disemboweled. I’m exhausted by the obsession of recreating racist worlds.<br /><br />In <i>Bioshock Infinite</i> you play as Booker Dewitt, and Booker doesn’t really care about racism one way or another. Oh, no, wait — I once ran into a black person who apologized for smoking in the back of a building, and Booker said something like, &#8220;Do what you want, I don’t care.&#8221; That&#8217;s Booker for you: except in combat, and except for the couple of times when he shouts after his sidekick, Elizabeth, Booker is cool as a cucumber. The setting of Columbia — the racism, the religion — slides off him like water off a duck&#8217;s back.<br /><br /><br /><h2>3.</h2>Columbia (and its racism?) seems to be the system installed by its founder, a man named Comstock. Comstock later turns out to be you, which made something twist around in my stomach. <em>What?</em> How could Booker be Comstock? What in this story ever alluded to the idea that Booker could ever turn out to be Comstock? Booker is like a duck that’s been floating around in an indoor swimming pool, suddenly being told that with one little nudge he could have been the creator of that indoor swimming pool. Okay, not the best analogy, but look at him! He&#8217;s a <em>duck</em>! How could he have gone from not caring about a black guy smoking in the back of a building, to someone who likens black people to dogs and says they should be thankful for the food and shelter given to them by their slavers?<br /><br /><br /><h2>4.</h2>There&#8217;s really something to be said about how completely wonderful it feels when your brain finds patterns. I screamed with happiness when we ended up in Rapture again. I grabbed Andou&#8217;s shoulder when Elizabeth looked over and said, &#8220;There&#8217;s always a man, a city, and a lighthouse.&#8221; My brain was like, <em>Hey, I know that! I thought that that beginning was all just homage, but it was on purpose! There&#8217;s always a lighthouse!</em><br /><br />So that&#8217;s what I wish I could pull in from an alternate dimension of game development: that Booker could have hesitated over racism — that he had had a chance to show that he could have been power-hungry, or obsessed with redemption, or obsessed with power enough to show how a the slightest nudge could have made him a Comstock monster. It would have been nice to see Booker reject his baptism and, when Elizabeth said there existed an alternate universe in which Booker accepted, to realize exactly what that meant. <br /><br /><br /><h2>5.</h2>Here was another fun part of the game&#8217;s story: the first mention of quantum physics. Both Andou and I leaped and began to freak out. Oh my gosh, quantum physics. Quantum mechanics. Schrödinger&#8217;s Cat. Is Columbia an epic experiment? Are we alive and dead?<br /><br />That paradox was so delicious that in some ways I wish that it had been everything, that somehow the setting could have abandoned its blaring, boring, meaningless racism and instead mused and ruminated on the significance or futility of our choices, and the consequences and not-consequences that bloom simultaneously after each. (Spare or kill? Bird or cage?)<br /><br />Booker already seems like a character set up perfectly for the agony of decision and regret: he kills Native Americans at Wounded Knee and seems to spiral downward from there, attempting (in one timeline) Christianity to clean away his presumed guilt. His room is cluttered with evidence of gambling, drinking. <em>Get the girl</em>, the game chants, <em>and wipe away the debt</em> — and imagine if Anna was some orphan he attempted to save, if she was a symbol of him trying desperately to do something good in his life, even if it meant the massacre of Columbia&#8217;s peons.<br /><br /><br /><h2>6.</h2>Heck, the racism would have been way more interesting if it had been flavored with Booker&#8217;s hypothetical thirst for forgiveness. Maybe the Booker that gets baptized can&#8217;t deal with his being a murderer, and redefines people of color to be less than human to cope. Baptized Booker can&#8217;t wait for his death to redeem him, so he takes heaven into his own hands, and decides who is saved and who is Sodom.<br /><br />As for the Booker that doesn&#8217;t get baptized, maybe he encounters Anna on the way home, and uses her as his redemption instead. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care how many people die,&#8221; Booker could snarl at one point, &#8220;if it means that you are safe,&#8221; if it means that his debts can be wiped away. Who are these Columbians anyway? Cult freaks — less than human.<br /><br />Ultimately both Bookers end up throwing away others for their own &#8220;Good.&#8221; So how important was that baptism, in the end? How malleable is fate, after all is said and done?<br /><br /><br /><h2>7.</h2>There has to be room for Daisy Fitzeroy in this alternate dimension wish-fulfillment narrative as well, because I loved her before she was revealed to be an empty cliche of an Angry Black Woman. Maybe she could represent what it takes to forgive people who have transgressed against you, or what it takes to even decide whether or not people deserve to be forgiven.<br /><br />&#8220;Even you can be good again, Booker,&#8221; Daisy might say if you made the right conversation choices. &#8220;Find forgiveness serving others.&#8221; They can glance over at Elizabeth pointedly.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll have my debts forgiven, alright,&#8221; Booker might mutter, still gruff.<br /><br /><br /><h2>8.</h2>All this forgiveness stuff could totally make Elizabeth&#8217;s final standoff with her &#8220;mother&#8221; more impactful too. Maybe it could even tie in with Elizabeth&#8217;s recurring issues with her supposed parents, her fury with them, how they &#8220;should&#8221; have been. How do Comstock and Booker try to protect her? How do their hopes and dreams live on through her, even when they die? Get it? Alive and dead at the same time? Eh? Ehhhh?<br /><br /><br /><h2>9.</h2>Yeah. A nugget of forgiveness would have been sick.</div>

But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves&#8211;and herself&#8211;while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.<br /><br />Tris&#8217;s initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable&#8211;and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.</blockquote><br />[spoilers ahead]<br /><br />Insurgent was okay. Like Divergent, it was full of action; unlike it, the action felt unfocused. Reading it was like going through an amusement park ride with great plastic things hissing from around very dark corner: thrilling, and not much else.  Insurgent tours readers around the enclosed communities of Tris’s world, but in a limited fashion: it’s still unclear why there are so many trains around for characters to use as transportation (who is even driving them? What are they carrying normally?), and until the end of the book I had completely forgotten that all the factions are enclosed in a fence.<br /><br />There were so many characters that I felt did nothing but burden the story. Though I could remember their names and a couple defining character traits (Lynn, &#8220;the bitter one;&#8221; Uriah, &#8220;the teasing hottie&#8221;), none of these characters really <i>did</i>&nbsp;anything to advance Tris’s understanding of herself or the world around her. For example, when Uriah is discovered to be Divergent, capable of somehow defying the simulation serums, the only consequence is a couple people snubbing him, slightly. Tris doesn’t seem to care one way or the other, so why should we? Even if the point is that Tris doesn’t care, why is it important at all that Uriah is Divergent?<br /><br />Some of these characters did contribute to powerful moments — I’m thinking in particular of when Marlene was entranced in a simulation that made her step off a rooftop — but even then Tris’s motivations seem unclear (Why did she save Hector? Why did Lynn thank her for it, and then say later that she loved Marlene? Huh?) and therefore overly dramatic.<br /><br />Ultimately I’ll still give the third book a try out of curiosity, because they’re so short and because pure &#8220;thrills&#8221; can still be delicious sometimes.</div>

Gabry spends every third page bemoaning the paths in her life that took or didn&#8217;t take or maybe will or will not take in the future, and occasionally is angry about things that I can&#8217;t understand her being angry about. Why did it upset her to learn she was adopted? Did she ever have a particular love for truth?

There are two boys to act as love interests and guardians, one best friend who repudiates her, a lot of body heat and soft lips and unexpected clutching.<br /><br />One thing I will say: that one giant chasm in the end filled with the undead was pretty cool.</div>

I tried using <a href="http://lift.do/">Lift</a> for a while. Having read <a href="http://zenhabits.net/sticky/">ZenHabit</a>&#8217;s encouragement that the way to start a habit is by just <em>starting</em>, even if it&#8217;s a little bit at a time, I thought Lift would be a good (and pretty) way to keep myself accountable. I rearranged my iPod home screen, putting it on my front page&#8217;s top row. I dutifully added three habits that I wanted to keep track of: getting exercise, writing, and more writing.<br /><br />Two things broke Lift for me.<br /><br /><strong>First — You can&#8217;t go back to previous days to mark what habits you did, but didn&#8217;t mark that day.</strong> Or maybe you can, and I just couldn&#8217;t figure out how? In any case, I have an iPod — I&#8217;m not connected to the internet through it every day — and stressing myself out by making sure I log into Lift at least once a day is something I&#8217;m not willing or happy to burden my completionist personality with.<br /><br /><strong>Second — ultimately, Lift isn&#8217;t meaningful enough to me.</strong> Though I&#8217;m working on getting both exercise and writing time, actually doing those things is the feel-good reward, and Lift doesn&#8217;t add to these feelings in any interesting way. Even with Tiny Tower, logging in once a day to mindlessly tap things gives you, eventually, an impressive tower. All Lift could do for me was represent my taps as a series of colored bars and occasionally send some canned inspirational e-mails.<br /><br />On a side note, it is fun to read Lift&#8217;s blog and see data compiled about people&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.lift.do/post/40128965086/infographic-your-goals-in-2013">2013 goals</a>, or other ways that people are using <a href="http://blog.lift.do/post/42988396863/lift-tip-rewards-for-good-habits">extrinsic awards</a> to keep themselves sticking to habits that I think are easy to justify yourself out of, such as not staying late at work.</div>

Yeah! It does make me wonder about the life cycle of this sort of app though. It seems to make itself obsolete by the success of its users (assuming success is defined by gaining intrinsic happiness). Then again, I suppose you could say that about a lot of things (like dating sites :P).</div>

If you&#39;ve gotten started and now actually doing your habits is your reward, then I&#39;d say you probably don&#39;t need Lift at this point anyway. :)</div>
