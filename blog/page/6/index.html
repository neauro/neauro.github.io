I&#8217;ve recently started using <a href="http://www.trello.com">Trello</a> to keep track of my myriad projects, and I love it because I can use it as an always-accessible repository of lists for ideas regarding games, writing, websites, homework, and so on. It&#8217;s also great for keeping track of resources like free icon sets. I&#8217;ve also been using it to manage and focus on what things are actually currently on my plate, and making sure I don&#8217;t overextend myself.<br /><br />My prime reading time has always been during my commutes, but I have been reading less because I&#8217;ve discovered <a href="">IA Writer</a>, a writing app which features a simple UI, a re-arranged keyboard, and integration with iCloud (which took me forever how to use; but it&#8217;s way more convenient than e-mailing myself everything). I absolutely adore it and have been using it for writing practice, which has in general alleviated my plaguing anxieties about not writing enough. I tried writing on the bus with my sketchbook but the bus&#8217;s movement made my scribbles illegible; typing on my iPod makes things easier, and even a little fun.<br /><br />I have also been hard at work on my part of this year&#8217;s group cosplay, Black Rock Shooter. I was initially going to go for Demon Cannon User, but then a friend dropped out due to busy-ness, and now I&#8217;m rocking Strength, for which I am actually attempting to build up strength to carry around the huge cardboard hands that Andou is helping me make.<br /><br />Winter quarter is also in full swing. This quarter I&#8217;m taking my first &#8220;practical&#8221; class, usability testing, and it&#8217;s funny — I always thought that I would find practical classes more immediately applicable — but instead I&#8217;m finding myself missing theory courses, where you could learn a theory and apply it <em>immediately</em>, instead of waiting to gather participants and test. I&#8217;m working with a group to improve and analyze the usability of <a href="http://www.mappingvoices.org">Mapping Voices</a>, which I was interested in for the potential application of game design — for example, how can you encourage people to take action against health inequity? How can you make people feel productive taking action?<br /><br />Though it looks like our suggestions will have to hold up against a bureaucracy and generally complicated organization, I&#8217;m looking forward to contributing to a local organization!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Right now I am totally in love with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julietta_Suzuki">Suzuki Julietta</a>. She is the manga-ka of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamisama_Kiss"><em>Kamisama Hajimemashita</em></a>, which recently got propelled in my mind to 5-star status after it started acquiring a time paradox, a plot device to which I am particularly weak. (How could she have planned that?! <em>Hoowww</em>?)<br /><br />Suzuki has a great grasp of storytelling and character development, something that I really appreciate in shoujo manga. Recently I described <a href="http://www.mangahere.com/manga/kamisama_hajimemashita/c065/">Chapter 65</a> (and 66) to Andou as an example. It goes like this:<br /><br />Nanami is making talismans for the shrine, so that visitors can come and get charms for things like &#8220;traffic safety,&#8221; &#8220;love,&#8221; &#8220;prosperous business.&#8221; Tomoe sees them and goes, &#8220;Your handwriting is awful, let&#8217;s make new talismans on the nice wood that I stored away.&#8221; Nanami admits that she thought that wood was trash and threw it away and feels bad that she&#8217;s disappointed him and hasn&#8217;t made much headway in being a good god. Later that night, she notices Tomoe leaving and follows him mistakenly across some ethereal border and is almost smashed by a giant&#8217;s foot. Tomoe saves her, and they wander around the night market searching for new talisman wood. Eventually Nanami separates from Tomoe and discovers two demons bullying a child, and when she tries to intervene, the two demons go for her instead. Wracking her brain for solutions, she eventually leads them beyond the ethereal border, where they are promptly smashed. They sneer that she will get stomped on too, but Nanami smiles and opens her coat to reveal: a talisman for traffic safety.<br /><br />There&#8217;s just something <em>so delighful</em> about the story coming back full circle. In a sense you should have expected it — maybe you had the fun of figuring out yourself how Nanami could have made it out of her situation — even if you didn&#8217;t, your brain lights up to realize the importance of something so seemingly insignificant. The final talisman also serves to answer her insecurities about being a bad god (even if her handwriting is bad, it <em>works!</em>), and as a bonus, makes Nanami to me a little more &#8220;real&#8221; — more of a person who is reacting to things in her environment, learning about them, using them.<br /><br />It&#8217;s just <em>great</em>, and by no means an isolated formula. For example, in <a href="http://www.mangahere.com/manga/karakuri_odette/v01/c001/">the first chapter of Suzuki&#8217;s other work, Karakuri Odette</a>, Odette begins attending high school, much to the hesitation of the school administrators. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; says Odette&#8217;s creator, &#8220;if she ever runs into problems, she&#8217;ll emit a signal to me, and I&#8217;ll pick her up right away.&#8221; They agree and as Odette tries to learn more about what it means to be human, she asks her creator to make adjustments to her body: first, to add the ability to eat food, and second, to subtract from her robotic physical ability so she&#8217;s only as strong as an average 15-year-old. Odette finds a new friend who is sickly and occasionally has seizures, and wanders around with her to a construction site, where both Odette and the girl fall into a well. Since she asked to be weakened, Odette can no longer climb out on her own — but then the girl starts to breathe desperately and beg for medicine — so Odette says, &#8220;Look away, don&#8217;t look back until I say so,&#8221; and when the girl turns away <em>Odette removes her head from her body</em> — which triggers the signal, and makes her creator come running.<br /><br /><em>So good!</em> There&#8217;s just something utterly delicious of a small detail turning out to mean everything. This is something that I think is a challenge to do with games. When you pick up a key in level 1, for example, it&#8217;s hard to imagine that it could be used to anything other than a treasure chest. (Though, knowing that, it would be fun to purposefully subvert this and make the key into an instrument for something else.)<br /><br />I&#8217;ve never played A Link to the Past, but apparently there&#8217;s a great example of &#8220;small detail coming back to bite you&#8221; in it. It goes kind of like this: In one of the first towns you visit, there&#8217;s a man who describes a nearby building as the old home of some evil bandit who for some reason couldn&#8217;t stand the light. You play on, and on, and eventually, you return to the old home, and rescue the maiden in it, who begins to follow you around as you make your escape. At some point, you set a bomb off in a room, which collapses a ceiling and lets the light in — and when the maiden walks into it, she rips her skin off and become&#8217;s the bandit. <em>The bandit, the dungeon&#8217;s boss, has been following you this whole time! Whoa! Ahhh!</em><br /><br />Delicious.</div>

She’s a second-class citizen with a mysterious past, reviled by her stepmother and blamed for her stepsister’s illness. But when her life becomes intertwined with the handsome Prince Kai’s, she suddenly finds herself at the center of an intergalactic struggle, and a forbidden attraction. Caught between duty and freedom, loyalty and betrayal, she must uncover secrets about her past in order to protect her world’s future.</em></blockquote><br />I just finished reading <em>Cinder</em> by Marissa Meyer and absolutely loved it, and am still trying to figure out why. It came with recommendations from some friends and Tumblr, whose endorsement loosened my fear that a &#8220;New Beijing&#8221; setting would be filled with all manner of gross exotifications a la <a href="http://beyondvictoriana.com/2010/02/13/beyond-victoriana-14-the-wind-up-girl-guest-review-by-jaymee-goh/">other future Asia books</a>. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t!<br /><br />I wavered a little when the love interest, Prince <strike>Charming</strike> Kai was introduced; off the bat he is introduced as having &#8220;copper-colored&#8221; eyes and a plethora of shrieking fangirls (really). Though I still could have done without the fangirls, Prince Kai on his own was fine — more than a love interest with swoon-inducing eyes, a perfectly tortured too-young politician with bangs and occasional sad gazes and statements. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he says at some point, &#8220;I guess I really should give up my life for my people :&#8217;(&#8221;<br /><br />(Sometimes this is exactly what I want. This is one of those times.)<br /><br />Cinder herself is a great cyborg. She isn&#8217;t just furnished with metal parts, she <em>is</em> them. She notes when her software tells her people lying; she escapes embarrassing moments due to her inability to blush; her moments of panic are accompanied by suggestions that she take deep breaths to decrease heightened levels of adrenaline. If there&#8217;s anything else I wanted out of this story&#8217;s cyborgness, it&#8217;s more of a reason why cyborgs are hated; at some point her stepmother snaps that Cinder can&#8217;t really feel anything, can she, but this just doesn&#8217;t seem reason enough for a society-deep fear and disdain. Maybe if there had been some big incident that made everything cling to and guard their own humanity as something they cherished, &#8220;true&#8221; emotions and all? (Maybe if this incident was related to the Luna?)<br /><br />One of the story&#8217;s Big Twists is something easy to call from the first 50 pages. Though I was tempted to feel disdained, after reading <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2013/01/books-of-2012.html">Wired for Story</a> and its mantra that &#8220;reads love to find delight in figuring out what&#8217;s going on!&#8221; I&#8217;m giving it a second thought. After all, it <em>is</em> pretty fun to know the secret from the beginning — to see Cinder dodge it — to know what&#8217;s really going on.<br /><br />Another aspect of this story that&#8217;s pretty cool is the amount of <em>stuff</em> going on — Cinder&#8217;s tension with her family, Cinder&#8217;s mysterious past, Cinder&#8217;s being hated as a cyborg, the soon-to-be-emperor, the psychic aliens, the plague. For the most part, however, all of these things were all tied together and impact Cinder and the events in the story.<br /><br />Ultimately, <em>Cinder</em> was a fantastic story about a character who gets disadvantaged and broken up again and again and continues to persevere and stick to her principles.<br /><br />[ spoilers ]<br /><br />That being said, I do wish that the Big Twist — that Cinder is Princess <strike>Serena</strike> Selene of the moon — had been played with a little more. For example, the character Dr. Erland clearly knows Cinder&#8217;s secret, and persists in lying to her about it, and this serves as a shallow obstacle, since there&#8217;s nothing about Dr. Erland that makes you suspect him or his motives. So he&#8217;s lying to Cinder — so what? It isn&#8217;t affecting anything, she isn&#8217;t going to be hurt by it. Imagine instead of Dr. Erland were more sinister — if you knew he knew Cinder&#8217;s identity, and if every time Cinder entered the room with him you were crying for her to just get out of there before something awful happened — that would have been <i>great</i>.</div>

Last year was pretty great, in terms of learning more about what sort of things I&#8217;m capable of, and navigating the bewildering world of (un)employment and health insurance. In 2012, I finally started earning a salary, health insurance, and a 401k at my &#8220;dream job,&#8221; and two months later was laid off —freed, so to speak, from my decade-long devotion to being a game designer. To be honest, the fact that I will never spend my life thinking <em>What if I had just pursued my dream</em> is an odd gift that I never would have expected to receive and am very thankful for.<br /><br />(Which isn&#8217;t to say that I&#8217;ve given up on making games! Though, with all the other stuff that I want to do and learn about recently, I also can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m completely devoted to it anymore either.)<br /><br />Recently I&#8217;ve been trying to focus on making the most of every day, rather than thinking about how I can influence things way in the future, and for that reason I wasn&#8217;t too inspired to make a particular resolution for this year. However, I would like to try and get one draft of a looong story done this year, and now that I&#8217;ve settled into more a more permanent residence and have gotten into the swing of full-time employment and graduate school, I think that such a goal is more within reach :)<br /><br />My other obvious goal is to have a dog, but between the aforementioned work and school I think that will end up being a resolution for a later year!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BroUUBWsEMQ/UOnuq0fFp-I/AAAAAAAAC_g/V25GuYgJeLM/s1600/5994955277_d230103497.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BroUUBWsEMQ/UOnuq0fFp-I/AAAAAAAAC_g/V25GuYgJeLM/s1600/5994955277_d230103497.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">soon, my sweet</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

I finished total of 114 books last year. That significantly beats my running average of 15 books per year since 2008 (though I admit I haven&#8217;t been as avid a user of Goodreads before this year). Before anyone starts getting intimidated, this total is comprised of books of a variety of lengths and content, including: young adult fiction; super grown-up adult fiction; delicious non-fiction probably about the history and political atmosphere surrounding a specific food item; graphic novels and comic books; albums of photography; at least half a dozen light novels; and one James and the Giant Peach.<br /><br />I owe it all to two things:<br /><br /><ol><li>Less school — who knew that only taking evening classes would leave you with so much free time?</li><li>So much commuting — a.k.a. two hours of dedicated reading time every day.</li></ol><br />And so, without further ado:<br /><br /><br /><h2>Memorable Books of 2012</h2><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most Life-Changing</span></h2><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GIPY7HZZT38/UOnwPPIcYbI/AAAAAAAADAw/WjpZWNa_hsY/s1600/Untitled-2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GIPY7HZZT38/UOnwPPIcYbI/AAAAAAAADAw/WjpZWNa_hsY/s1600/Untitled-2.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Wired for Story, </i>Lisa Cron &amp; <i>Reading Like a Writer</i>, Francine Prose<br />(source: Goodreads)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Among all of the non-fiction that I read this year, these two books together were personally the most &#8220;life-changing&#8221; ones, because before I even finished either of them I felt my entire outlook on reading, writing, and story completely changed. <i>Wired on Story</i>&nbsp;focuses on scientific concepts and general &#8220;story architecture,&#8221; whereas <i>Reading Like a Writer</i>&nbsp;hones in on recognizing and interpreting writing on the &#8220;micro&#8221; scale, and on holding each word to the light to see its color.

They were all fine and didn&#8217;t quite have the visual appeal or charm of the anime, but I&#8217;m singling out the most recent volume because of its completely unexpected <i>what the fuck </i>factor, which involves (spoilers) cloning the &#8220;human soul&#8221; part of babies&#8217; brains, and placing them into a virtual environment to see how they &#8220;grow up.&#8221; Researchers monitor decades and generations of these isolated, disembodied humans in ease, as every year in the virtual environment lasts only a minute in the real world (or something like that). At some point one of the researchers experiments with cloning his own brain into a computer, and when they turn on the speakers, they hear the researcher&#8217;s voice, aghast and desperate: <i>&#8220;What do you mean, </i>I&#8217;m <i>the clone?

It&#8217;s a book that I think everyone should read if they&#8217;ve ever had to put themselves through high school US history courses. It discusses not just the whitewashing of history, but the strange and problematic air of idolization held for history figures like President Woodrow Wilson, and the politics of textbooks with regards to concepts like classism. It also has a ton of interesting stories about historical people of color. (For example, did you know that there was a Native American named Squanto who was captured by Englishmen, then somehow avoided slavery and made his way to London, then tried to make it back to North America and ended up back in England again, and then finally returned to North America some years later?

I intended for it to have more of a chullo-shape but in the end confused myself and ended up just going back to the familiar rectangular shape the yields triangle ears.<br /><br />I have a lot more brown and white fleece left which I hope to use for future corgi- or shiba-related endeavors!</div>

By the end of the film, Jack&#8217;s character also undergoes a transformation to solve his problem:&nbsp;<i>My purpose is to share my love of &#8220;fun&#8221; with children, and now they believe in me. </i>In contrast, Ralph&#8217;s &#8220;transformation&#8221; seemed weak and frustrating to me personally; at the beginning he is a character who longs for recognition and acceptance, and at the end becomes happy because he gets&#8230;recognition and acceptance. It&#8217;s just a little boring. It&#8217;s like a story about someone who says, &#8220;You know what I would like? $5.&#8221; And then that someone meets a princess who gives him $5. The end!</li><li><b>The other primary characters interacted with Jack in ways that helped him with his transformation.</b>&nbsp;Santa teaches Jack the idea of a &#8220;center,&#8221; or something that Jack is <i>all about,</i>&nbsp;which Jack realizes he doesn&#8217;t know. Tooth teaches Jack that he was someone before he was Jack Frost, and later is an example of how the Guardians have become misaligned with their previous love of caring for children. Bunny is a sort of litmus test for Jack&#8217;s familiarity with the Guardians, and the Sandman&#8217;s death was what triggered Jack&#8217;s supercoldblizzard power (or whatever). The antagonist, Pitch, was also a foil for Jack, representing the &#8220;bad side&#8221; of wanting to be seen and recognized so badly that you would want children to fear you. In contrast, the interactions between Ralph and characters like Felix and <strike>Jane Lynch</strike> Sergeant Tamora were pretty shallow, and after the Hero&#8217;s Duty part of the movie, whenever you saw Tamora it was really just for romantic comedy fluff that had nothing to do with the movie&#8217;s title character.</li><li><b>The Tooth Fairy had her own not-man-related things going on, </b>including but not limited to control of whatever the fairy army is called and a love of gummy, bloody teeth that was amusingly ridiculous. Compare to the Sergeant, whose motivation is hate for the bug-things because they killed her husband (in her fake memories). It&#8217;s true that Tooth was fangirly about Jack&#8217;s teeth and all of her fairy minions were swooning over Jack&#8217;s hoarfrost bangs but I&#8217;ll take what I can get.</li><li><b>No romance! </b>(Beyond that too-long hug at the end between Tooth and Jack?)&nbsp;Just, thank you for not stuffing that into the movie, especially since it was already bursting its seams with all the fast-paced kingdom-touring and gold particle effects. (On a related note, #rainbowsnowcone and #frostbite seem to be what the shippers are calling Frost/Tooth.)</li></ul><br />There were a couple plot holes in the movie that bothered me somewhat (Why did they only need to round up teeth for one night to save Tooth? After everyone fell asleep in Jamie&#8217;s room, why were they suddenly in the sleigh, still-sleeping, later?) but I have been reading <i>Wired for Story</i>&nbsp;by Lisa Cron recently, and one of its tenets is that good stories are not about what just events that happen, but about the changes that happen in their characters. I&#8217;m not ready to forgive all plot holes for this reason, but it does give me a new lens into what details are the most important in story. In the case of these two movies, Jack&#8217;s change from the invisible, meaningless delinquent into someone that uses his fun for good is what made him so much more compelling to me, and enjoyable to watch as well.</div>

Potato chips are my snack of choice. I saw this book and thought, <i>Wow, that is a great-looking bag, and honestly, it&#8217;s got all the ingredients I really appreciate in a bag of chips.</i> I finished it in a single day, and then just felt like&#8230;<i>Well&#8230;that&#8217;s it, I guess. </i>Time to look for something else to eat.<br /><br />(This, by the way, brings the number of dishes at my book-banquet up to at least three, the first items being <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/10/legend-marie-lu.html">cheesecake</a> and <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/12/blind-willow-sleeping-woman-haruki.html">green tea pudding</a>.)<br /><br />I thought the world was interesting, but I felt that its &#8220;grim&#8221; aspects were there to decorate the space of the story, rather than used to interact with it.&nbsp;<strike>Ravnica</strike>&nbsp;Ravka has supposedly rampant poverty, but no one really faces it.&nbsp;Ravka has been war-torn for hundreds of years, but there&#8217;s no real evidence of it except for the strong militia, who are shown not fighting battles, but escorting people across &#8220;the Unsea,&#8221; and fetching things for a dark dude called (surprise) the Darkling.<br /><br />It&#8217;s kind of hard for me to bring up more critique about the characters in this story, mostly because I care so little about them. The Darkling and the main character Alina had some clever flirty dialogue, I guess. Mal seemed like a non-problematic male character, hurray. All the girls in the story seemed pretty flat. There&#8217;s a super-talented bully, two friendly gossipers that Alina hangs out with but doesn&#8217;t like, and a girl who can wield magical cosmetics who is jealously possessed by the Queen and alluded at some point to have been used for sex by the King. (On a side note, Bardugo seems to work as a makeup artist in Hollywood, so the presence of a makeup-y character is pretty cute.)<br /><br />The writing fell really flat for me, maybe because I&#8217;d just come away from <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/12/blind-willow-sleeping-woman-haruki.html">Haruki Murakami</a>. It was effective and easy and I raced through it, but it wasn&#8217;t especially poignant. I felt like a good chunk of it was spent just describing the simple reds and blues and blacks of the coats people were wearing, or the elaborate carvings on the walls of the palaces Alina is in. (By the way, because Ravka is separated from its &#8220;True Sea&#8221; by &#8220;the Unsea,&#8221; I was dying for Alina to see mother-of-pearl inlay on the palace walls and be like, <i>What the fuck, that stuff is awesome.</i>&nbsp;Unfortunately, no such drama occurred.)<br /><br />The Russian premise was interesting, but I was disappointed to learn through Goodreads reviews (like <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/283956289">this one</a>) that the Russian language was often misused and incorrect. Naming the magical miliary &#8220;Grisha&#8221; is the Russian equivalent of naming it &#8220;Bill&#8221; in English. <a href="http://ykmreviews.blogspot.com/2012/08/071-stormdancer-by-jay-kristoff.html">Appropriation in other young adult novels</a> bothers me, and this one is no exception.<br /><br />Well&#8230;that&#8217;s it, I guess.</div>

I&#8217;ve never read Murakami&#8217;s short stories before, but enjoyed these ones, mostly because reading novels by Murakami for me is like falling into a dark, magical pit, and upon landing at the bottom you are left winded, stranded, and a little bit at loss but convinced that you saw sparkling things on the way down so it was all pretty cool overall.<br /><br />In contrast, reading each short story here was like eating green tea pudding. Your mouth, meeting the first bite, finds it bitter and creamy and bewildering; meeting the second, acclimates, and thinks, <i>Oh wow, okay, whoa, this is great</i>; and then you&#8217;re opening your mouth for the next mouthful and there&#8217;s nothing but spoon.<br /><br /><i>Wait! But &#8211; what &#8211;?</i><br /><i><br /></i>I have no idea. But those first two bites were pretty good.</div>
