<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
This is a quick rehash of what we&#8217;ve learned in the previous week!<br /><br /><span class="sig">Disk Caching</span><br />So the OS can optimize operations done by scheduling things, either <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/01/operating-systems-notes-chapter-5-cpu.html">CPU</a> or <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/02/operating-systems-notes-memory.html">memory</a>.  The operating system can also schedule disk operations, which are reads/writes from/to the disk (that far-off entity which stores the data you want, yet is time-consuming and expensive to reach).<br /><br /><strong>Disk scheduling</strong> is optimized especially through <strong>disk caching</strong>.  Disk caching can come in two flavors.  <strong>Write caching</strong> is when the user has the data that they want to write to disk, and the OS, rather than writing that data directly to the disk, instead writes it to a cache.  Then, sometime later, the OS writes everything in the cache to the disk.  There&#8217;s a sort of &#8220;five minute rule&#8221; to this, where (very roughly) every &#8220;five minutes or so,&#8221; the cache gets &#8220;flushed&#8221; to disk.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wDujboA5CPU/TV4Ffh_w4XI/AAAAAAAAAHs/qyHyYUHJcPs/s1600/writecaching.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="81" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wDujboA5CPU/TV4Ffh_w4XI/AAAAAAAAAHs/qyHyYUHJcPs/s320/writecaching.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">our TA&#8217;s lecture notes are so cool</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There&#8217;s also <strong>read caching</strong>, which is when the operating system reads data from the disk into a cache, so as to be easily and quickly accessed by the user later.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6A1WwUsxBH8/TV4FjpY-ETI/AAAAAAAAAH0/UahzFruaJtY/s1600/readcaching.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="83" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6A1WwUsxBH8/TV4FjpY-ETI/AAAAAAAAAH0/UahzFruaJtY/s320/readcaching.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">look at this. &nbsp;just look how understandable this is</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />One way to take advantage of disk caching is to use <strong>memory mapped I/O</strong>.  The data in a disk cache exists in kernel space, so what&#8217;s an easy way for a process in user-space to get a hold of it?  To have the process contain a mapping directly to that disk cache!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OU-tACxsM5Q/TV4GYm7X0jI/AAAAAAAAAH8/BQaW5asqgME/s1600/memorymappedio.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="126" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OU-tACxsM5Q/TV4GYm7X0jI/AAAAAAAAAH8/BQaW5asqgME/s320/memorymappedio.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">these colors are just so neat</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The segment of a process&#8217;s <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/02/operating-systems-notes-memory.html">virtual address</a> which has been mapped is called a <strong>memory-mapped file</strong>; in this case, it&#8217;s the blue part.<br /><br />As the process uses the file, it may need to write to it, which means eventually that the pages that the user-space process altered will need to be flushed to disk, or written out to disk.  The OS will know which pages to write thanks to the alteration of a dirty bit.  When the ditry bit is high, that means that the page has been altered and will need to be flushed.  <span class="shh">(Somehow this whole paragraph feels a little gross&#8230;)</span><br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">RAID Levels</span><br />are another thing that we&#8217;ve been talking about in lecture.  The thing about disks in general is that though they are a pretty useful/necessary storage device for computers, they&#8217;re super messy &#8211; they run into errors all the time, like bad blocks, or missed seeks.  Part of the job of the operating system is to hide all this messy-ness from higher-level software (i.e. software that other, more sane programmers will write to be run on the computer).  The OS will provide different levels of access to different clients &#8211; for instance, allowing them to access physical disk blocks (a specific head, or cylinder of the disk) or just logical disk blocks (i.e. a program says &#8220;I want disk 6&#8221; and the OS retrieves the real location of &#8220;disk 6&#8221; itself).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pZ8QGur6iSg/TV4MPA-H3hI/AAAAAAAAAIE/Sv47rFhynK0/s1600/harddrive.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pZ8QGur6iSg/TV4MPA-H3hI/AAAAAAAAAIE/Sv47rFhynK0/s320/harddrive.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is what a disk looks like, by the way</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It takes time for an OS to find something on a disk.  The performance is based on three main things:<br /><ol><li><strong>Seeking</strong>: how long it takes to move the disk arm to the correct cylinder on the disk</li><li><strong>Rotation</strong>: how long it takes to wait for the sector you want to rotate under the head of the reader.  This depends on the rotation rate of the disk, which is not increasing that quickly, mainly because the way disks are made now, if they spin any faster they&#8217;ll fall apart</li><li><strong>Transfer</strong>: how long it takes to transfer data from the surface of the disk into the disk controller, and from there back to the process that wants the data</li></ol><br />The OS mainly tries to reduce seek times and rotation.<br /><br />So, since disk transfer rates in general are improving, and since CPU performance isn&#8217;t, what you can do to improve performance is have multiple disks containing/transferring data.  In particular, you can &#8220;stripe&#8221; files across multiple disks by placing parts of each file on a different disk, making it so that you can read parts of a file simultaneously (i.e. use <strong>parallel I/O</strong> to read a single file).<br /><br />The problem with striping is that it&#8217;s not very reliable.  To improve its reliability, you can add redundant data to the disks, along with striping, and thus &#8211; <strong>RAID: Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks</strong>.  Since disks are physically small and cheap, you can just stick a lot of them into one box to increase storage, performance, and availability.  Depending on how you stripe data, you can affect resulting performance and reliability in different ways.<br /><br />What are some things to consider in different methods of striping?  Firstly, <strong>granularity</strong>.  If you stripe each file across multiple disks (&#8220;fine-grained&#8221; granularity), you will get high throughput for reading the file, but limit overall transfer to one file at a time.  If you stripe each file over only a few disks (&#8220;coarse-grained&#8221; granularity), you limit throughput for 1 file, but can have concurrent access to multiple files.<br /><br />Another thing to think about is the <strong>redundancy</strong> itself.  If you uniformly distribute redundancy, then you&#8217;ll avoid load-balancing problems.  You can also concentrate redundancy information on a subset of your total disks, and make it so that some of your total disks are &#8220;data disks&#8221; and the others are &#8220;redundancy disks.&#8221;<br /><br />So what are the different types of RAID?<br /><br /><strong>RAID Level 0</strong> is when you have a non-redundant disk array &#8211; files are just striped across disks, with no redundant info saved at all.  There&#8217;s high read throughput (since you can do the parallel I/O thing), and also high write throughput (since you don&#8217;t need to write redundant info).  However, if one of your disks fails, then you can lose the file and sometimes the entire volume, which is horrible. D: D:<br /><br /><strong>RAID Level 1</strong> is also known as &#8220;mirrored disks.&#8221; Files are striped across half the disks, and when you write data, it gets written to both a &#8220;data disk&#8221; and the &#8220;mirror disks,&#8221; which are copies of the data disk.  This way, if the data disks fail, you can just use the surviving disks.  A downside to this technique is that you need to have 2N the amount of space to hold N amount of data, understandably.<br /><br /><strong>RAID Level 2, 3, 4</strong> all pretty much have the same idea, I guess &#8211; they all use error correcting code (ECC) or <strong>parity disks</strong> to provide fault tolerance.  Each byte on a parity disks is a parity function of the corresponding bytes on all the other disks.  This way, a read accesses all data disks.  A write accesses all data disks, as well as the parity disk.  If the disk fails, read what you have of the file and then use the parity disk to compute the missing data.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hxvTkkUW3Bs/TV4N-F5JUiI/AAAAAAAAAIM/CHZ7y8sofE0/s1600/parity%2Bdrives.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="105" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hxvTkkUW3Bs/TV4N-F5JUiI/AAAAAAAAAIM/CHZ7y8sofE0/s320/parity%2Bdrives.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">yeah! &nbsp;go parity drive, go!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />But, <strong>what is parity, again?</strong> I guess, given a byte, you want to add a bit set so that the total number of 1&#8217;s in the byte is even; that way, any single missing bit can be reconstructed.  Parity bites are used as the simplest form of error detecting.<br /><br /><strong>RAID Level 5</strong> uses <strong>block interleaved distributed parity</strong>, which is just like the parity scheme of earlier RAIDs, but instead of having one parity disk, the parity info is distributed across all disks.  For each block, one disk holds the parity, and the other disks hold the data.  This type of RAID has significantly better performance, since the parity disk is not a hot spot.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MwfHA3qWfcQ/TV4O_26wZlI/AAAAAAAAAIU/FyZ1f6cnCsA/s1600/raid5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MwfHA3qWfcQ/TV4O_26wZlI/AAAAAAAAAIU/FyZ1f6cnCsA/s320/raid5.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">RAID Level 5 disk layout</td></tr></tbody></table><br />So when you use RAID, you can also use a <strong>RAID controller</strong>, which is embedded in the hardware.  A RAID controller can make it seem to the OS like the many disks you&#8217;re using is actually just one disk.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gvTCVSUmMAU/TV4PdUh6pbI/AAAAAAAAAIc/qiESnTQW4-M/s1600/raidcontroller.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="135" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gvTCVSUmMAU/TV4PdUh6pbI/AAAAAAAAAIc/qiESnTQW4-M/s320/raidcontroller.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">&#8220;What&#8217;s that? &nbsp;I only have one disk? &nbsp;Oh, cool&#8221;</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The advantages of putting <em>policy</em> in the RAID controller is that it makes the OS&#8217;s job easier.  The disadvantage is that every time you put a layer of abstraction into something, you ruin the chance of optimizing it.  So, putting this layer of abstraction makes the OS a little simpler to program, but now you can&#8217;t optimize the OS (like, using disk scheduling effectively) the way you could if the OS <em>did</em> have control of and was aware of all of its assets.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">Solid State Disks (Flash)</span><br />We also talked about flash drives, which was pretty interesting.  Like disks, the data on a flash drive is stored in blocks.  Since there aren&#8217;t any spinning platters, random access is fast, and you don&#8217;t need disk scheduling algorithms.  It&#8217;s very fast to read from a flash drive thanks to the random access, but slower to write to a flash drive, because the flash media must be erased before it can be written to.  So, when you&#8217;re writing to a solid state drive like a flash drive, you&#8217;re actually a) reading some block, b) erasing that block, c) writing back the modified block.  But, there are ways of &#8220;hiding the warts of an SSD&#8221; (as these section notes put it), mostly by virtualizing pages and blocks on the drive (so you&#8217;re working with logical pages, not physical pages), and doing &#8220;wear-leveling,&#8221; which is when you try to spread our the erasure of blocks evenly over the drive.<br /><br />Meanwhile, what is a solid-state drive?  Evidently it&#8217;s just a data storage device toat uses solid-state memory to store persistent data.  &#8220;Solid-state&#8221; refers to a type of electronics which are build entirely from solid materials, within which electrons or other charge carriers are confined within the solid material.  Solid-state memory I think is like RAM, which gets erased once you shut down your computer, but as of 2010, most solid-state drives use NAND-based flash memory, which can hold memory even if there&#8217;s no power running through it.  &#8220;NAND flash&#8221; just refers to the way that the transistors are hooked up in the flash drive: in a way that resembles a NAND gate.<br /><br />Sources:<br />section 7 notes<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file">Wikipedia: Memory-mapped file</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_disk">Parity Drive</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit">Parity bit</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_state_drive">Solid-state drive</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_(electronics)">Solid state (electronics)</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#NAND_flash">NAND flash</a><br />lecture 12 notes (&#8220;Disk&#8221;)<br />lecture 13 notes (&#8220;Raid and Volumes&#8221;)</div>
