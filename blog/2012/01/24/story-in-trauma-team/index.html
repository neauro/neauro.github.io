The Mexican character was, unfortunately, the subject of many a boob-shot, and was also pretty frustratingly&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere">tsundere</a>&nbsp;at times; and in general the females all had the same, petite facial structure. &nbsp;Personality-wise, though, they were all strong and interesting, with motives that 100% did not involve getting with the men around them. &nbsp;(Though there was a bit of Maria/That Dark Brooding guy near the end&#8230;before he went back to his lifestyle of alternating between doing surgeries and jail-time.)<br /><br />Some bonus fangirling: the best part of this game, hands-down, were Kimishima&#8217;s cases. &nbsp;I <i>loved</i>&nbsp;piecing together the facts, figuring out how someone had died (though most of them were pretty straight-forward), learning about Kimishima&#8217;s weird &#8220;I can hear the dead&#8221; cellphone and the fact that other characters accepted that she had such a device without complaint (&#8220;You and your voodoo cellphone&#8230;&#8221;). &nbsp;Gabe Cunningham&#8217;s voice actor (apparently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Willingham">the same as for Roy in Full Metal Alchemist</a>) had <i>so much life</i>&nbsp;(the best part being when he sang &#8220;chunky~~&#8221; at the American politician). &nbsp;Also, Atlus&#8217;s bold, colorful interfaces are so&nbsp;fun to interact with.</div></div>
