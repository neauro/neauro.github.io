  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
The other day I tried applying to a job through the Amazon Careers website, and the experience was pretty interesting.<br /><br />The normal Amazon Careers website has a frame to the right which is the container for search results and job details.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tiEdJuD-92M/TlSShbRW-4I/AAAAAAAAAXU/VASbkoT6w2I/s1600/amazon2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tiEdJuD-92M/TlSShbRW-4I/AAAAAAAAAXU/VASbkoT6w2I/s640/amazon2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">aww yeah. &nbsp;so much opportunity for employment</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hjc2SGREjoo/TlSSmNRiiBI/AAAAAAAAAXc/r6P_kWXshuo/s1600/amazon3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="346" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hjc2SGREjoo/TlSSmNRiiBI/AAAAAAAAAXc/r6P_kWXshuo/s640/amazon3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the first listing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Unfortunately for me at the time, I was given a direct link to an internship which filled up the entire page.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FQD3hDyeSd0/TlSYFVqLdtI/AAAAAAAAAYE/v_ascKp2iqA/s1600/amazon22.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FQD3hDyeSd0/TlSYFVqLdtI/AAAAAAAAAYE/v_ascKp2iqA/s640/amazon22.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">does the font need to be that small?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I think the link itself is deprecated because I couldn&#8217;t find the job by searching through Amazon Careers, but I didn&#8217;t know this at the time. And the last time I tried to apply for a job to Amazon before this was a couple months ago, so I already had a profile, albeit completely unrelated to the position that I was applying for now.  Still, I pressed &#8220;Apply Now,&#8221; thinking that I could change that information before submitting.<br /><br />But the next page that showed up said, merely,<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpDjHR0C2c/TlSSxH52sVI/AAAAAAAAAXs/gJqwGgMfelY/s1600/amazon7%2B--%2Bstep%2B4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpDjHR0C2c/TlSSxH52sVI/AAAAAAAAAXs/gJqwGgMfelY/s640/amazon7%2B--%2Bstep%2B4.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wait&#8230;what about the first three steps?!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />&#8220;Step 4 of 4&#8221; could only mean &#8220;This is the last step before submitting your application,&#8221; so I applaud the transparency of it. &nbsp;Still, for some reason I went and clicked through anyway, thinking that I&#8217;d still be able to change what irrelevant or old information that I had on file.  I didn&#8217;t.  Ack!<br /><br />So I searched in haste for &#8220;My Account&#8221; to put in my application information. When I eventually found it It looks like this:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zp07gj5RBmI/TlSS07TDhJI/AAAAAAAAAX0/vzDs1gLiq5I/s1600/amazon5%2B--%2Byour%2Baccount.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zp07gj5RBmI/TlSS07TDhJI/AAAAAAAAAX0/vzDs1gLiq5I/s640/amazon5%2B--%2Byour%2Baccount.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">unexpectedly sparse</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The text is, to me, a little small for a page that has nothing else on it.  I guess it&#8217;s easily remedied by just increasing the font size. &nbsp;(Also, is that a dangling list element?)<br /><br />The &#8220;Your Profile&#8221; page is similar.  This is where you fill in all the information that will be used to apply to whatever job at Amazon that you so desire.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Wm2YVsUul4/TlSS67FYm4I/AAAAAAAAAX8/ETuOW4i4FfM/s1600/amazon6%2B--%2Byour%2Bprofile.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Wm2YVsUul4/TlSS67FYm4I/AAAAAAAAAX8/ETuOW4i4FfM/s640/amazon6%2B--%2Byour%2Bprofile.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is everything Amazon needs to know about you.<br />name, address, and the last three degrees you earned (not pictured)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />So then I uploaded my profile, and&#8230;what? &nbsp;I&#8217;m still not quite sure whether the updated information is being used for the application that I had already submitted.  I imagine that it is, but even so, a confirmation would be nice.<br /><br />These are the things that I wish had been different about this process in general:<br /><ul><li><strong>I want to see what information you&#8217;re submitting to a job</strong>.  Or, at least, a recap of what steps 1, 2, and 3 had been before I went through step 4.  Even now, months after first creating my account, I can&#8217;t reconstruct what the previous steps would have been.  &#8220;Sign up, Fill in Information, Find Job and Apply?&#8221;</li><li><strong>I want the ability to apply to jobs that are completely different in nature.</strong>  In particular, I wish that I had been able to submit different resumes to different jobs, or that I could provide a cover letter for each one.  (I normally hate writing cover letters, but this position in particular was one that I enjoyed writing a cover letter for.  Ah, wasted effort!</li><li><strong>I want less fields about what school you went to on your Profile page</strong>.  How many applicants does Amazon have every day that have been to <em>three</em> post-high school schools?  Are there enough to justify making <em>everyone</em> go through filling this spaces in?</li><li><b>I want a notification about selection or non-selection of a position.</b>&nbsp; The whole process is pretty automatic-feeling anyway, so having a confirmation e-mail that an application was selected, or an e-mail gently letting down your hopes would be nice, haha.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><div>As a note, in order to get the &#8220;Step 4 of 4&#8221; screenshot I pretended I was applying to another arbitrary job, and the application still went through though I pressed &#8220;back&#8221; rather than the final &#8220;Submit.&#8221; Out of curiosity, I just checked its status on the &#8220;Your Account&#8221; page.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DiZd3KoYPo/TlSV-PsCDwI/AAAAAAAAAYA/Mmc4a0s_LYQ/s1600/amazon8.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DiZd3KoYPo/TlSV-PsCDwI/AAAAAAAAAYA/Mmc4a0s_LYQ/s640/amazon8.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">it reads, <i>Reviewed, Not Selected.</i><br />oh well, i guess</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Which makes me think:</div><div><ul><li>Wow, someone reviewed my application fast!</li><li>Or else the computer just read through my resume quickly and tossed it out?</li><li>Wait, why are the other positions I applied to not showing up? &nbsp;Did my real application not actually go through? &nbsp;Or does this status thing just expire after a week or so?</li><li>Also, why does my application for the Design Intern position still say that my application is already on file, when this page obviously doesn&#8217;t have it listed?</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>In conclusion: I have a weird feeling that people don&#8217;t really get jobs through career websites, but through career fairs and internal connections, so I suspect the entire site is just a front anyway, haha.<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b>&nbsp;Oh! &nbsp;I did receive an automated &#8220;We received your application!&#8221; e-mail for the job I arbitrarily applied to just to obtain a screenshot. &nbsp;But it still reads &#8220;Reviewed, Not Selected&#8221; on the status page.<br /><br />¯\_(ツ)_/¯</div></div></div></div>

Chris came to visit!  And we visited San Francisco Zoo because I have wanted to and have not had buddies nearby that enjoy the act of going to the zoo enough to just go and bear with my taking pictures of everything.<br /><br />(Full set of zoo pictures is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/sets/72157627363783575/">here</a>.)  This time, though, I didn&#8217;t take hundreds of pictures like I normally do, probably because I&#8217;ve been to Woodland Park Zoo in the past couple months and because <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/raws-vs-jpeg-fine.html">I&#8217;m restricting myself to RAW now</a>, which means less space for pictures.  If I couldn&#8217;t see anything but an animal&#8217;s back then I usually just passed.  Being so conservative probably wasn&#8217;t complete necessary since I had about 300/500 shots left at the end of the day, but, so it goes.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6067715466/in/set-72157627363783575" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GGNwYYb04gM/TlHb4drP7hI/AAAAAAAAAWg/q8VB0E-92fY/s640/6067715466_3ef6295dd5.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">cool story bro</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Zoos are always kind of tough because on one hand, animals are great!  And on the other hand, these animals are trapped here in small exhibits, pacing and staring out the wires and sifting the mud over and over again for&#8230;what?<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6067162379/in/set-72157627363783575" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qqxrQgcCFSg/TlHn_l76_GI/AAAAAAAAAWo/hPy6Ml2pT0s/s640/6067162379_8feebd51d0.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">something. &nbsp;anything</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The primates in particular always depress me, probably because they look so human.  And the flamingos by one of the dining areas would constantly spread their wings and then flap them all together, as if trying to rise up as one.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6067159605/in/set-72157627363783575" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tyOUVqTHkxk/TlHsihF4QaI/AAAAAAAAAWw/TuGnzurGmXA/s640/6067159605_fd438f5edd.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh&#8230;.right</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The zoo was, as usual, filled with children, trolling seagulls, nervously approaching goats at the petting zoo, listening vaguely as parents sometimes asked them questions about the world around them and taught them things about the animals that they read on the supplied placards by each exhibit.  Information everywhere; not like the internet, but for easy perusal relevant to the current circumstances of one&#8217;s physical presence.  Eating lunch with Chris beside the flamingo pool, I looked down and saw that my burger was in a box lined with yet more information.  An explanation of why three of the nine subspecies of tigers are extinct.  Encouragements to eat organic and local.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5MfqMl1-fro/TlHu-lohGKI/AAAAAAAAAW0/LbBrqU3W5BE/s1600/200px-OmnivoresDilemma_full.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5MfqMl1-fro/TlHu-lohGKI/AAAAAAAAAW0/LbBrqU3W5BE/s400/200px-OmnivoresDilemma_full.jpg" width="263" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">ha! &nbsp;i see what you did there!<br />(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omnivore's_Dilemma">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />I can&#8217;t even think of any other places where people will happily go to be informed about something that is not really relevant to their everyday life, much less have a good chance of taking that information, finding it reasonable and un-offensive, and considering it, and acting upon it. &nbsp;Science museums are different, because everyone agrees <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-11-23/politics/obama.science_1_science-education-math-and-science-president-obama?_s=PM:POLITICS">science is good</a>; at the very least, someone would more easily agree to the idea that science is good, than to agreeing that &#8220;eating less meat is good,&#8221; or &#8220;ensuring impoverished people are not exploited for our benefit is good.&#8221;<br /><br />In any case, the quote in the Children&#8217;s Zoo seemed pretty legit &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember it exactly, but in essence it went, &#8221;<em>Teach children how to love something and they will work to protect it</em>.&#8221; The gorillas and the flamingos are martyrs.  The kid screaming at his half-finished Cheezit and bending down to pick it up and replace it in his mouth is a potential future warrior of the earth.</div>

&#8230;omg.  The human is cubicled in the zoo of society.  We are ALL unwilling martyrs.  But then for whose benefit is it?  Just our families and individual day-to-day survival?  Haha.</div>

Interesting point - I hadn&#39;t thought about zoos being a place where people go to be informed about something that&#39;s not directly relevant to them&#8230; Though maybe you could argue that almost all entertainment is like that. But you have picked out an important distinction, I think.<br /><br />Maybe they&#39;re martyrs, unwilling martyrs if that is even possible. The way I tend to think about it, which I realized a couple years ago at the zoo, is that these animals are no worse off than we are. The caged chimpanzee is to wild chimpanzee as the cubicled human is to prehistoric human. Better health care, perhaps, but everything else is so wrong. This is one reason why Avatar resonated with so many people, I think.</div>

This morning Kelly and Chris and I grabbed breakfast at Boogaloo&#8217;s in Valencia (which is delicious&#8230;and oh man, have I not actually eaten since then?!  It&#8217;s filling too!).  Then Kelly showed us his monome in his apartment, and I discovered his stash of Arpakasso.  I ask if I could take them away for pictures before he redistributes them to his sisters, he says yes, I frolic away and spend the rest of the day taking endearing shots.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6068256474/in/set-72157627364814073" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bIx2iqImLwM/TlHzdtelJpI/AAAAAAAAAXE/kb100UP2s-Y/s640/6068256474_27149e500d.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />One thing that I love about Arpakasso is the personality of each Arpakasso&#8217;s face.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
A couple nights ago I attended the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/gamesjs/events/27773901/#initialized">GamesJS Kickoff Meeting</a>, at which were speakers discussing the advantages of game development in HTML5 and JavaScript.  It was held at IGN.  The place turned out to be filled with a lot of indie game devs, and a lot of the advantages toted were that of the cross-platformability of games built using HTML5 and JavaScript, which can go on phones and computers without any worries of Flash compatibility.  Plus, for any indie game dev, to choose only one platform for your baby heavily limits its potential audience.<br /><br />I have to admit now that the only thing I know about HTML5 is that it has a &lt;canvas&gt; tag.  I know JavaScript, but not to its very fibers.  I was mainly going as a deep-dive, and man, there were so many technologies that I have never heard before, and am bookmarking here for later investigation:<br /><br /><strong>crafty.js</strong><br /><a href="http://craftyjs.com/">crafty.js</a> is the Flixel of JavaScript.  Collision detection!  Sprite maps!  Woo!<br /><br /><strong>jsFiddle</strong><br />The presentation for crafty.js had a lot of this <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a> stuff, which I guess is like a JavaScript console, which is super cool.  I talked to Kelly about it excitedly and he was like, &#8220;Yeah.  It&#8217;s pretty neat.  <span class="shh">I guess.</span>&#8221; lol kelly whatever<br /><br /><strong>Spaceport</strong><br /><a href="http://sibblingz.com/">Spaceport</a> is another game engine which aids cross-platform support from web to iOS.  Write your JavaScript and translate it to ActionScript like instantly!  It has super good performance and will be in public beta sometime in September.  You can purchase a license or, if you are a poor game dev, you can use Spaceport through a revshare model.<br /><br /><strong>V8</strong><br />During the Spaceport presentation, talk about something called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> suddenly happened.  It turns out that <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/v8/intro.html">V8</a> is Google&#8217;s &#8220;open source, high performance JavaScript engine…written in C++ and used in Google Chrome.&#8221;<br /><br /><strong>Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</strong><br />The last speaker was a woman from Google who spoke briefly about <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a>, which is a &#8220;Java software development framework&#8221; which allows you to build user interfaces, have client-server communication, etc.  You can deploy applications you make to the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.<br /><br /><strong>PlayN</strong><br />I couldn&#8217;t actually find a link for this yet, but PlayN is relevant to games on Google+.<br /><br /><br />There is just SO MUCH technology in the world.  People didn&#8217;t really talk to each other during the meetup (then again, I came late and perhaps wasn&#8217;t trying hard enough to ~*network*~ with everyone), but still, being in a place like this really makes me feel inspired to learn more about everything.<br /><br />Afterward, Kelly, Jonah and I walked through downtown talking about all the places we&#8217;ve been and the bros we had and went to Bi-Rite Creamery.  I tried the Dainty Gentleman, which is a concoction of: 2 scoops of honey lavender ice cream, with drizzles of hot fudge and blood orange olive oil, sprinkled with seasalt.  You would not believe the amazing flavors that comes out of this combination.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
For whatever reason, adding a model to a database in Rails took me forever to understand.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kellydunn">Kelly</a>, I now have model-making in Rails down to an art.<br /><br />Want to add a new table or a new column to your Rails application?  This is what you do!<br /><br /><br /><h3>1. Create a new .rb file for your model</h3>Let&#8217;s say that, just like me, you want to create a new database table in your application to keep track of information about dogs.  We (by virtue of the same logic which affords physics problems friction-less vacuums with which to work in) already have a couple tables in our database: one pertaining to users (breeders or owners of dogs), and one pertaining to breeds.  We will keep it simple for now; all we want to know about a dog object for now is what its name is, what user it belongs to, and what breed it is.<br /><br />To add a Dogs table, we first need to create a file which will describe its model.  Part of this is describing what the relationship of the new model is to existing models, like User and Breed.  From real-world experience, we know that a dog generally has one user/owner, and one breed.<br /><br />So, create a file in <strong>app/models/</strong> called <strong>dog.rb</strong>, and type in the following:<br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class Dog &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />  belongs_to :user<br />  belongs_to :breed<br />end<br /></pre>Dog inherits Active Record.  Active Record&#8217;s sole purpose of existence is to help create associations between different objects.  This code will later be macro&#8217;ed out by Active Record into something more lower-level to create the associations.<br /><br />The lines that start with <code>belongs_to</code> describe the relationship that this new model has to existing ones.  Basically, a dog belongs to one owner/user, and to one breed.  <br /><br />Rails also has another keyword called <code>has_one</code>, which at first might also seem like an okay association to make between dogs and users; after all, a dog <em>has_one</em> user, right?  <a href="http://duanesbrain.blogspot.com/2006/05/ruby-on-rails-hasone-versus-belongsto.html">But belongs_to is more correct, because has_one implies more of a one-to-one relationship</a>, where you might be doing something like creating a new user every time you create a new dog.  Since users may later obtain more dogs, <code>belongs_to</code> would be more appropriate in the case you want to attach a new dog to an existing user.  (Note: belongs_to also makes it so that the Dogs table will have to be responsible for its foreign key with Users, whereas it would be the opposite case for has_one.)<br /><br /><br /><h3>2. Change your existing models to reflect their relationship to the new model</h3>Because a User can have many dogs, and have many different breeds of dogs, User should now look like this: <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;acts_as_authentic<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :dogs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :breeds, :through =&gt; :dogs<br />end<br /></pre>And because many dogs can be of a certain breed, and breeds can be owned by multiple owners, Breeds will look the same &#8211; <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class Breed &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :dogs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :users, :through =&gt; :dogs<br />end<br /></pre><br /><br /><h3>3. Generate a new migration</h3>Now you have to create a migration which, when run, will create the relevant tables in a structured manner.  You could also be hipster about it and edit SQL on your database by hand, but then you&#8217;d would have to tell the other people you&#8217;re working with of what you&#8217;ve done if they have local databases, or else run the same SQL on production databases.  With migrations, you can make changes modular, and even roll back changes easily.<br /><br />Run <code>rails g migration create_dogs_table</code>.  This will create a file in <strong>db/migrate</strong> which will look something like this: <br /><blockquote><strong>20110807213821_create_dogs_table.rb</strong></blockquote>The numbers on the left are a timestamp, which is needed by Active Record so it will know what migrations that you haven&#8217;t yet run, so that it can run them for you.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>4. Edit the migration file to describe what tables or columns should be added to your database.</h3>Open your migration file and type in these things: <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class CreateDogTable &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration<br />  def self.up<br />  end<br /><br />  def self.down<br />  end<br />end<br /></pre><code>self.up</code> is executed when a database is updated; <code>self.down</code> is executed when a database is rolled back due to errors.  So, in <code>self.up</code> you want to create your new tables and columns; in <code>self.down</code> you want to define code to remove those tables and columns.  With dog objects, all we said we cared about earlier was the name, so let&#8217;s just make a table which will (automatically) contain a unique ID, a timestamp, and a string for each dog object.  <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class CreateDog &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration<br />  def self.up<br />    create_table :dogs do | d |<br />      d.timestamps<br />      d.string :name<br />    end<br />  end<br /><br />  def self.down<br />    drop_table :dogs<br />  end<br />end<br /></pre><br /><br /><h3>5. Run the migration to create your table</h3>Run the migration by typing <code>rake db:migrate</code>.  Remember how the migration that we generated had a timestamp?  When you run <code>rake db:migrate</code>, Active Record can use those to figure out all the migrations that might have been added to your code base, which have not yet been run on a certain database (such as the one pertaining to production).  Also, because the code to create and drop data from a database is so high-level, it doesn&#8217;t really matter whether your actual code is in sqlite3 or in MySQL.  You can even use both depending on whether you&#8217;re in development or production stages.<br /><br />Hurray!  Now you have new tables and columns in your database!  <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><br />Sources: <br /><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kellydunn">Kelly</a></li><li><a href="http://ar.rubyonrails.org/">RubyonRails.org: Active Record</a></li><li><a href="http://duanesbrain.blogspot.com/2006/05/ruby-on-rails-hasone-versus-belongsto.html">Duane&#8217;s Brain: Ruby on Rails : Has_One versus Belongs_To</a></li></ul></div>

Kelly has been being really hipster and avoiding auto-generating files :P But thanks!  Now that I know how to create stuff &quot;model dog&quot; should be easier.  Also, &quot;change&quot; sounds definitely more convenient.  Thanks!</div>

If you do &quot;rails g model dog&quot;, the model, migration, tests and test helper files are automatically generated.  <br /><br />Also, in Rails 3.1, you don&#39;t have to define both up and down methods if down is obvious from what up is.  You can just define a method &quot;change&quot; with the contents of &quot;up&quot; would have been, and rails can figure out &quot;down&quot; by itself.<br /><br />The only caveat is that if change is drop_table, you have to use down and up, because rails can&#39;t figure out what columns to add back if you roll back the drop.</div>

It was for a position that I felt was made for me &#8211; involving writing, drawing, design, some management too.  (Managing soothes me because I feel like I have an eye on everything that&#8217;s going on.) Despite my enthusiasm I think I still wasn&#8217;t able to explain myself properly, and I blame it in some part on Skype.  I struggle with communicating effectively over electronic things like phones and video-chats.  People&#8217;s eyes don&#8217;t meet, there are no visual cues, they don&#8217;t see that I&#8217;m fiddling with the cork of this delicious Cupcake Red Velvet wine that I finished yesterday as I think.<br /><br />The internet connection is faulty.  Did they understand what I said?  Did I really understand what they said?  Am I being too silly?  <em>Are my feelings of pure love for video game design and story reaching you through these pixels?</em><br /><br />Man, I love the comfort of words that you can think through before you write, then think through after you write, then revise if necessary.<br /><br />One thing they asked was for further demonstration of my ability to sketch things out in perspective, or make layouts, so after RPG today (every Tuesday with the other interns) I drew out a short rendition of Little Red Riding Hood, the whole of which you can view <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/post/8727734003/sf-day-43-mondays-man-sf-day-44-had-an">on Tumblr</a>, where it looks much prettier, thanks to the whole <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/08/good-design-moves-tumblr-has-made.html">tiled photosets</a> thing.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve drawn things &#8220;with perspective&#8221; since the endless corridors of elementary school, but these were fun to do. :)</div>

There is one thing in particular that I wish Skype would change about its UI, and I think it&#8217;s mostly influenced by my experience using another <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/05/playerio-thoughts-on-bigdb.html">2.0-y bright blue user interface</a>.<br /><br />I&#8217;m talking about the little side menu that comes up over your chat messages, which offers you a variety of possible actions for that message.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sgPTg-1XhdE/TkNONrn37eI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/ejBSr5mVeLw/s1600/skype2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="116" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sgPTg-1XhdE/TkNONrn37eI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/ejBSr5mVeLw/s640/skype2.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">man, I should have taken a bigger screenshot</td></tr></tbody></table><br />When I am clicking on my own chat, these are the things that I probably want to do, in order:<br /><br /><ol><li><b>Edit </b>whatever foolish, silly thing I just wrote</li><li><b>Remove</b>&nbsp;whatever now-irrelevant thing I just wrote</li></ol><div><br /></div><div>I can only imagine <b>Copy</b>&nbsp;or <b>Quote</b>&nbsp;to be useful in cases when I want to be snarky. &nbsp;(<i>I already said that! &nbsp;Exactly 5 minutes and 3 seconds ago!</i>) Or maybe if I&#8217;m cross-posting between chats? &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know. &nbsp;I accept there is a use case that I haven&#8217;t encountered for those options.</div><div><br /></div><div>Nevertheless, <b>what I really wish I could do in Skype is click <i>anywhere</i>&nbsp;on a chat-message of mine and have it open up into something I could immediately edit</b>, much like Player.IO&#8217;s treatment of objects in its database. &nbsp;The menu could then be reserved for the lesser use cases of Removing, Copying, or Quoting.</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of the menu, could we also make that little arrow larger? &nbsp;The little arrow that opens that menu in the first place?</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V7fU6z-5WlI/TkNNvNn6bMI/AAAAAAAAAWI/3vOz8JgvCK8/s1600/2011-08-10_1256.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="120" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V7fU6z-5WlI/TkNNvNn6bMI/AAAAAAAAAWI/3vOz8JgvCK8/s640/2011-08-10_1256.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">do you see it?</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>Since there&#8217;s nothing usually relevant to the right side of the chat-message anyway, it would help a lot if the hitbox for the menu was larger. &nbsp;Also, if the menu opened up automatically, instead of me having to click it&#8230;!</div><div><br /></div><div>Just thinking about it is exciting. :D</div></div>

<strong>Tiled Photosets</strong><br />If you wanted to post more than one picture at a time on Tumblr, it used to be that the pictures would be placed into a little slideshow applet.  It was really elegant and cute; you would see one picture at a time, and could press a little rounded arrow to move on to the next picture.<br /><br />The problem is, no one would use it.  Or at least, if people did post this way, it didn&#8217;t get interacted with.  (At least, I didn&#8217;t, and the rare frequency with which I met up with a photoset on my dashboard makes me think that others didn&#8217;t really like this method of posting either.)  On Tumblr people just scroll, scroll, scroll.  Occasionally laugh.  And don&#8217;t stop for your dang photosets.<br /><br />Then, suddenly!  A tiled photoset appears!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CZrjAQAmsGI/TkCxzPGtDgI/AAAAAAAAAVg/78Ui_m8CiTk/s1600/photoset.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="526" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CZrjAQAmsGI/TkCxzPGtDgI/AAAAAAAAAVg/78Ui_m8CiTk/s640/photoset.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">with varied photo sizes, even!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />All of a sudden, you can see all the pictures in a photoset at once!  Plus the given layouts for different pictures make them all look really artsy, which Tumblr users love, because let&#8217;s be honest, over half of us are there just reblogging stuff.  Though another mark of how cool this feature is is how people have taken creative liberties with it, making sets of images like <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/8598587153/flashinglightsandecstasy-lol-xd">this</a>, or <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/8572474978">this</a>, or even <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/8436544789">this</a>.<br /><br />Making a feature which fits with how people actually use the product, and allows them to be creative?  ++!<br /><br /><br /><strong>Reblogging Tags</strong><br />I actually just noticed this today.  Never again will I have to repopulate the tags of something that I&#8217;m reblogging.  As an example, <a href="http://textless.tumblr.com/">textless.tumblr</a> is a great blog for macro photography of insects (and other animals), and the photographer always dutifully tags all of his posts with whatever is pictured.  <em>Wooly Aphid.  Larva.  Wasp Mimic. Secropia Silkmoth.</em>  (These tags often even get cut off in the dashboard post.  I can&#8217;t find an example now, but may later.)  In any case, though I love the accuracy of it, no way am I going to spend any time tagging these reblogs with anything more than &#8220;photo&#8221; and maybe &#8220;bug.&#8221;<br /><br />Fortunately, now tags also get reblogged!  So, now reblogging things can make you feel even more productive with even less energy. :)<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S_bvkOlgoOE/TkC4Lq-KX2I/AAAAAAAAAVo/bnrweSPmG8E/s1600/photoset2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="258" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S_bvkOlgoOE/TkC4Lq-KX2I/AAAAAAAAAVo/bnrweSPmG8E/s400/photoset2.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">thanks, tumblr. &nbsp;you the bomb</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><strong>Edit:</strong><br />Now if only tags were easier to remove than pressing that teensy little X beside every rounded-corner box.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oWzXOJfPEgI/TkNLEo_SODI/AAAAAAAAAV4/7vyWJbuxfDA/s1600/tumblr3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oWzXOJfPEgI/TkNLEo_SODI/AAAAAAAAAV4/7vyWJbuxfDA/s400/tumblr3.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Edit 2:</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This feature was eventually removed.

@jshou I was thinking about it!  I was thinking I could probably make a set of my favorites on Flickr and then randomly populate them everytime that page loads.</div>
