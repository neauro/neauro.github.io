<p>This time the theme was <em>Monster</em> and for this story I have to admit that I was heavily inspired by <em>Howl&rsquo;s Moving Castle</em> and <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>. <a href="https://twitter.com/couch_crusader">Chris</a> helped me come up with a name for my main character, though I hope that name isn&rsquo;t <em>too</em> obvious.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still working on a place to host my writing online. For now, if you&rsquo;re in Seattle, you can pick up a copy at Bulldog News!</p>

<p class="caption">AU Issue VIII at Bulldog News</p>


<p>I&rsquo;m into my last couple months as a UW student, and these are my last couple months to submit to <a href="http://strayingfromreality.wordpress.com/">AU</a>, UW&rsquo;s speculative fiction journal. Since the <a href="/blog/2012-12-30-short-story-golemists-work.html">last time I&rsquo;ve written about it</a> I&rsquo;ve had two more acceptances! The story that I&rsquo;ll talk about in this post is <em>Chronectomy</em>, written for the Winter 2012, Issue VIII prompt: <em>chronos</em>, or time.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/chronectomy2.jpg" alt="Chronectomy!"/></p>

<p class="caption">Chronectomy! I LOVE what the editors did with the &#8220;O&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>


<p>I came up with an idea almost immediately and wrote furiously for a couple hours before realizing I was writing entirely the wrong story, and redid the entire thing. I&rsquo;m still working on a place to host my short stories online, but at least for now you can read <em>Chronectomy</em> on <a href="http://neauro.com">my portfolio</a>.</p>

<p>[ spoilers follow ]</p>

<p>I was really happy with the way I described the chronectomy clinic in this draft, but there were a couple problems overall that made me realize I had to totally redo it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I intended this draft&#8217;s appeal to be that the audience has no idea what&#8217;s going on, but I realized that I wanted to write something a little deeper. In this draft, once you realize that the clinic is about removing memories, there&#8217;s not much else to get out of it.</li>
  <li>The protagonist of this draft, Alice, doesn&#8217;t have a very clear motive. Again, I was relying on there to be some kind of &#8220;Oohh, why is she here?&#8221; feeling to pull the audience through, but I wasn&#8217;t confident that all this exposition and description would be fun to read on its own, when you don&#8217;t even know why the character is there.</li>
  <li>At the end, I wanted to pull a sort of &#8220;Whoa! Bet you didn&#8217;t see that coming!&#8221; moment, where the clinician suddenly steals the protagonist&#8217;s memories for himself — but I realized that by the time you reach the end, you don&#8217;t know enough about him at all to care that he stole her memories, nor do you know why he did so. You also never know the protagonist well enough to care that her memories were stolen, since she&#8217;s shrouded in mystery for the draft&#8217;s majority.</li>
  <li>Since the original prompt was related to &#8220;time,&#8221; my initial intention was to explore what people would do with time — selling it, donating it, using it to heal their mental trauma, and so on. When the clinician starts reciting all these uses to the protagonist, I realized that those things were all way more interesting than what was happening right then in the story, and that furthermore, all these uses were just being talked about, and not actually experienced.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, I realized the better perspective to use for this story was not Alice but the clinician, and why he would steal someone else&rsquo;s memory in the first place.</p>

<p>Draft below the cut.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A is starting a certificate program in game design this quarter and I&rsquo;ve been helping him with his card game, Invent-o-thon.</p>

<p>The prompt being something related to <em>Victorian Combat</em>, he first went around researching what people &ldquo;first thought of when they think about the Victorian Era,&rdquo; and I was happy to hammer in the presence of Ada Lovelace, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">The World&rsquo;s First Computer Programmer</a>. Because I&rsquo;m more interested in stories, I also talked with him about stories — in particular, making noteworthy experiences that people are excited to talk to each other about after the fact. Or, in general, creating situations in which people&rsquo;s imaginations are prompted and stretch and fill in ridiculous gaps.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/inventothon/playtest1.jpg" alt="What is a faith-powered tummy mobile?"/></p>

<p class="caption">what is a faith-powered tummy mobile FIGURE IT OUT DO IT</p>


<p>A obtained a bunch of card sleeves and post-it notes for our paper prototyping. The point of the game is to create an invention over several rounds, then present it at &ldquo;showtime&rdquo; to everyone and roll dice to see if your invention explodes. Thus far, players construct machines using three decks: one deck to describe a &ldquo;power source&rdquo; (like &ldquo;electric&rdquo;), one deck to describe a &ldquo;subject&rdquo; (like &ldquo;kittens&rdquo;), and one deck to describe the actual invention (like &ldquo;generator&rdquo;).</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/inventothon/playtest1_cards.jpg" alt="Playtest cards"/></p>

<p class="caption">physically impossible bathtub packer</p>


<p>We also gathered friends to do a playtest at a cafe.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/inventothon/playtest2.jpg" alt="Playtest cards"/></p>

<p class="caption">kind of pathetic pleasure chamber&#8230;and others</p>


<p>One of the most valuable things learned from prototyping was which cards were compelling and funny, and which cards weren&rsquo;t — descriptive cards that seemed perfectly fine, like &ldquo;hydro-powered&rdquo; or &ldquo;solar-powered,&rdquo; were just not as fun to use as &ldquo;perfectly ordinary&rdquo; or &ldquo;rather moist&rdquo; and never quite made it to showtime. It makes sense that something like &ldquo;perfectly ordinary&rdquo; lights up more parts of your story-minded brain than &ldquo;hydro-powered,&rdquo; and overall could have more flavor. (What&rsquo;s a &ldquo;perfectly ordinary kitten-mobile&rdquo;?)</p>

<p>I sketched out some possibilities for card designs&hellip;</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/inventothon/cardsketch.jpg" alt="Sketches of cards"/></p>

<p class="caption">sketches of cards</p>


<p>&hellip;and A also reined in his sister for some concept art of character roles that players could have that affected their inventions. For example, someone who was Benjamin Franklin might be able to totally swap inventions with someone else before showtime. (Oo! Sick burn!)</p>

<p><em>Thomas Was Alone</em> was super cute, if more ambiguous than I personally like. I liked the personality given to all the different shapes, though their common heroism and conceit got a little old as the game went on, which was why Laura&rsquo;s cynicism made her my favorite (though I felt compelled inexlicably to keep calling her &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo;). I loved that the levels were tilted, the play of light, the strange colors. (Though I wonder if any colorblind users had a hard time playing?)</p>

<p>One thing I think the game could have been improved was the game&rsquo;s sense of progression; though numbers ticked up each level, after a while they became meaningless, and now that the game is finished I&rsquo;m not totally sure what I would use them for. The introduction of each of the colored shapes, Thomas&rsquo;s &ldquo;death,&rdquo; and the era of the gray shapes seemed to be the largest movements in the story, and though each was accompanied with a fun snippet of &ldquo;The AIs are gaining sentience!&rdquo; flavor I didn&rsquo;t really have a sense that things were reaching their end until the end came suddenly to meet me. Some levels seemed like little &ldquo;drabbles&rdquo; and experiments, which I completed without much more effort than would take for me to click a cow in Farmville, and it would have been cool to see something else related to AIs breaking their previous ways of being. Breaking through the borders of levels — intentionally disobeying orders — something to add to the flavor text.</p>

<p>I played <em>Thomas Was Alone</em> on a projector and if you have the opportunity to do so yourself I recommend it. All those rectangles are like way better when they&rsquo;re as big as your face.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been putting off getting a virtual machine running on the Mac computer I use for work, mostly because I wanted to forget the existence of &lt;IE9 browsers entirely. Unfortunately, the visual bugs accumulating across my projects were starting to get a little ridiculous.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/proleft.png" alt="Screenshot of IE8 errors"/></p>

<p class="caption">omg why</p>


<p>After some hours of searching and fiddling, I discovered my favorite solution for running IE on a Mac. It goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the relevant/recent version of Oracle&#8217;s <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>.</li>
<li>Use the Terminal and and run <code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | env IEVMS_VERSIONS="8 9" bash</code> to download 2 virtual machines; one that can run IE8, and one that can run IE9.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s it! Once that&rsquo;s finished, you can open VirtualBox and you&rsquo;ll see your boxes all ready to go.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/virtualbox.png" alt="Screenshot of IE8 in VirtualBox"/></p>

<p class="caption">only IE8 is pictured above</p>


<p>Thanks to <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/09/04/internet-explorer-for-mac-ie7-ie8-ie-9-free/">OSXDaily</a> for the post that led me to finding <a href="https://github.com/xdissent">xdissent</a>&rsquo;s awesome installations.</p>

<p>Other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>border-radius</code>, <code>rem</code>, and <code>opacity</code> are some of the many words not recognized by IE8.</li>
<li>PressF12 to open up IE8&#8217;s Developer Tools.</li>

<p>For whatever reason, <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> is becoming my social media site of choice, probably because its humor appeals to me so much. I also love that it supports people easily creating blogs that cater to specific topics &mdash; like <a href="http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/">people of color in medieval art</a>, or <a href="http://moviecode.tumblr.com/">source code in TV and films</a>, or <a href="http://tabcloseddidntread.com/">intrusive pop-ups</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve made my own tumblr for gathering examples of <a href="http//delightful-ux.tumblr.com">delightful user experience</a>, which is my main interest when it comes to the wide world of human-centered design. Even though I love it, I&rsquo;m still muddy on what comprises a delightful user experience, and thus far have tossed in examples of <a href="http://adobe.breach.il.ly/#/about">useful websites with friendly wording</a>, as well as <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/post/71660750263/hells-pizza-coffin-box-new-zealand-based-hell">pizza box designs with unnecessary but awesome utility</A>, and <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/post/71681828062/australian-sharks-send-tweets-to-warn-swimmers">sharks with Twitter accounts</a>.</p>

<p>For now, when deciding whether to add an example, I ask myself, &ldquo;Could this Thing accomplish what it currently accomplishes, but in a more boring way?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Does this Thing solve for an action that is not-that-fun to do?&rdquo; And if the answer to either is &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; — lo, thusly do I deem it delightful.</p>

<p>I understand that second question might still catch Things that are not entirely playful — but I&rsquo;m not going to stress out about differentiating between design that&rsquo;s good and design that fulfills some nebulously defined good feel.</p>

<p>If you have encountered a good feel recently yourself, feel free to <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/submit">submit</a>!</p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/10/24/phoenix-wright-dual-destinies-review-f8ea4d29/">via</a>)</p>


<p>After NaNoWriMo finished, my pastime of choice during my commute became playing through <em>Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies</em>.</p>

<p>[ spoilers ahead ]</p>

<p>Athena was a cool protagonist, though scenes where she was relegated to &ldquo;cyncial dude&rsquo;s naive, enthusiastic female sidekick&rdquo; were yawny. (Come on! Maya and Trucy are already these characters, we don&rsquo;t need more of them.) Ultimately it&rsquo;s nice to see that Athena has her own reasons for entering the attourneyforce, and though they were man-centered they were also totally platonic, which was nice. Athena&rsquo;s devoting to &ldquo;saving&rdquo; Blackquill also mirrored her desire to save her best friend, Juniper Woods, which meant her dramatic, heroic tendencies at least were in character.</p>

<p>Mostly I was happy to see old characters again, even Apollo Justice, who I disliked before but liked in <em>Dual Destinies</em>, probably because he was now a familiar face, haha. What I wanted most out of this game was to see Maya again, but I guess a note from her will do in lieu of <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>I also liked <em>Dual Destinies</em>&lsquo; execution of &ldquo;telling the end at the beginning.&rdquo; One of my favorite parts was realizing that Apollo had had an eyepatch over his eye even <em>before the courtroom explosion</em> — it was a fun/cute manipulation of the audience&rsquo;s assumptions that that particular bandage was just part of his injuries.</p>

<p>Good examples of &ldquo;the end at the beginning&rdquo; does <em>not</em>, however, include all the times that the game felt obliged to either tell you who the antagonist was, or make it clearly obvious, and PWDD&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&comic=123013">serious case of the hand-holdies</a>&rdquo; led to me to really only loving the game&rsquo;s final case, and feeling shruggy about the others. It would have been nice if each case had contributed more to each character&rsquo;s development as well; &ldquo;Ninetails Vale&rdquo; in particular didn&rsquo;t feel tied to anything in the larger story, and as a standalone wasn&rsquo;t terribly interesting to me either.</p>

<p>Documentaries are my whitenoise of choice. Due to studying, I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot more of them on Netflix.</p>

<p>More recently, I&rsquo;ve two documentaries about orcas: <em>Killer Whales</em> by the Discovery Channel, about the behavior of killer whales in the wild; and <em>Blackfish</em>, about orcas held in captivity. They&rsquo;re both pretty incredible; I&rsquo;m shocked at how much footage there is of killer whales doing things, whether it&rsquo;s hunting poisonous sting rays in New Zealand or yanking human beings into pools by their ankles.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hilarious to watch the footage of killer whales hunting seals in the first documentary, with a voiceover of a man marveling at their intelligence; and to watch this footage again in the second, where the background noise is preserved, and a woman is panicking, &ldquo;Oh no! Oh no! <em>On noooo</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Blackfish</em> also connected nicely with the last essay in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Science-Nature-Writing/dp/0547350635">The Best American Science and Nature Writing (2011)</a>, though the writer states there that one of the orca trainers was pulled by her hair into the water, whereas trainers in the <em>Blackfish</em> movie argue that this is a lie, another way to &ldquo;blame the victim&rdquo; of the orca attack, rather than the orca itself and the poor treatment that drove it to &ldquo;psychopathy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A and I went to see <em>Frozen</em>, a movie I had very little interest in seeing until I realized Idina Menzel was voicing a main character. There&rsquo;s been a lot said already for the lack of diversity amongst the characters (regarding both <a href="">race</a>, as well as <a href="http://sapphicdalliances.tumblr.com/post/68881922280">the representation of women</a>) and my disappointment about these issues in <em>Frozen</em> has exhausted me utterly. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it. Instead, I want to note aspects of the overall story that A and I discussed after the movie.</p>

<p>[ spoilers ahead ]</p>

<h2><em>Frozen</em> is about Elsa and Anna</h2>

<p>This is great. From the trailers, there was almost no indication that the story&rsquo;s main conflict involved the relationship between two women. Anna struggles somewhat with the men in the story, and though she desires &ldquo;true love&rdquo; at its beginning, lovers never usurp her existing relationship with her sister. At the end, Anna even plays the main role in saving both Elsa and herself, through the power of ~<em>True Love</em>~! Hurray!</p>

<h2>But what does <em>Frozen</em> do with &ldquo;True Love&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>&ldquo;True Love&rdquo; seems to be Frozen&rsquo;s main theme. Elsa&rsquo;s version of True Love is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t harm those who you love,&rdquo; and requires her to isolate herself as a precaution to harming her sister; the fact that doing so makes both her and Anna unhappy are not as important as Anna&rsquo;s safety. At the end of the movie, Elsa realizes (somewhat abruptly) that her version of True Love is flawed, presumably because it&rsquo;s more about fearing herself, rather than loving someone else. (…right? This actually happened so suddenly that I&rsquo;m just going to believe that this is the case.)</p>

<p>In contrast, Anna&rsquo;s version of true love — which could be described as &ldquo;Always believe in someone that you love&rdquo; — has absolutely no fear involved. Despite everyone&rsquo;s warnings and panic, Anna continues to believe the best of Elsa, even when Elsa actually <em>does</em> harm her.</p>

<p>I like how Elsa and Anna&rsquo;s interpretations of love clash in this movie, but one thing I don&rsquo;t like is that, though Elsa&rsquo;s view of love evolves by the end of the movie, Anna&rsquo;s view remains static. From the beginning Anna is the same &ldquo;open to loving people!&rdquo; character that she&rsquo;s shown to be from the beginning, despite events that show people can harm her: Elsa ostracizes her, Love Interest #1 (Hans) betrays her. That these events don&rsquo;t change her outlook on life feels like a waste; rather than actively choosing to love people, for Anna it&rsquo;s just a given, and this takes away from her complexity and agency as a character.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that the events of the movie are put into motion by Elsa&rsquo;s fear that she might kill Anna, and by the end of the movie, it&rsquo;s revealed that there was no way that Elsa could have ever killed Anna at all. The entire time, Anna had a magical understanding of &ldquo;True Love&rdquo; that could have <em>always</em> saved her from Elsa&rsquo;s power, which makes the entire plot somewhat of a non-issue.</p>

<h2>And what did the other characters do?</h2>

<p>Given that the movie&rsquo;s main conflict is Elsa and Anna&rsquo;s relationship, and true love, the other major characters — Kristoff, Olaf, and Hans — all felt thrown in. I would have loved to see them all focused to serve the &ldquo;true love&rdquo; theme by addressing love in different ways. Treated differently, Kristoff could have been a great catalyst for Anna&rsquo;s development of her version of love. I&rsquo;m inagining him, a character distrusting of other humans, teaching her about the horrible things humans do; she fights it (&ldquo;No way, humans are inherently Lawful Good!&rdquo;); Kristoff then points out that her sister is laying waste to their kingdom and also has been pretty mean in general to people; Anna cracks a bit; and then, right on cue, Anna is betrayed again by Hans.</p>

<p class="caption">omg will she now become totally jaded? or will she still choose looove? (<A href="http://turntherightcorner.com/2013/09/27/movie-trailer-for-disneys-frozen/disneys-frozen-2013-screenshot-princess-anna/">via</a>)</p>


<p>Kristoff&rsquo;s dislike of humans is played up without explanation of how it came to be, as if he had simply dropped out of the sky as a perfectly-formed gruff male love interest. I would have loved to see more time spent on him and his relationship with Sven and the snow trolls, rather than other seemingly extraneous details of his character. For example, why is it important that Kristoff is an ice merchant, and what was the point of the opening scene that is dedicated to showing his childlike failure at selling ice? You learn later that Kristoff was adopted by the trolls, and distrusts other humans; so if Kristoff was actually homeless at the beginning of the movie, why did he have a sled and ice-harvesting tools at his disposal? (Or was he not homeless? Are we just supposed to be okay with his abduction?) My headcanon involves Kristoff having saved Sven from the cruelties of humans in his life — meeting the trolls — realizing that they&rsquo;re way better.</p>

<p>Olaf was a character I grimaced at in the movie trailers and ended up being pleasantly entertained by.</p>

<p>Even though his main purpose is comedic entertainment, it would have been nice to see more about what he means to Anna and Elsa&rsquo;s relationship. He&rsquo;s their precious childhood snowman, and is really the only indication Anna has that Elsa still treasures her after years of being isolated.</p>

<p class="caption">love again, anna! do iiit! (<A href="http://www.rotoscopers.com/2013/09/27/ten-things-we-loved-about-the-new-frozen-trailer/">via</a>)</p>


<p>As for the last major-ish character, Hans: I wasn&rsquo;t too interested in him, and wish that all the time devoted to him was given to the other characters instead. Hans is too flat, an antagonist that comes out of nowhere, affects no one uniquely, and isn&rsquo;t redeemed. Anna could have been betrayed by any other person; Kristoff could have found any other, more character-specific reason to back off from being with Anna.</p>

<h2>In conclusion</h2>

<p>I had a lot of fun watching <em>Frozen</em>, particularly with the ~<em>twist</em>~ of Anna saving herself. And her kiss at the end with Kristoff was such consensual wow! Also, the particle effects were great.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is not a peaceful time in the Dells. The young King Nash clings to his throne while rebel lords in the north and south build armies to unseat him. The mountains and forests are filled with spies and thieves and lawless men.</p>

<p>This is where Fire lives. With a wild, irresistible appearance and hair the color of flame, Fire is the last remaining human monster. Equally hated and adored, she had the unique ability to control minds, but she guards her power, unwilling to steal the secrets of innocent people. Especially when she has so many of her own.</p>

<p>Then Prince Brigan comes to bring her to King City, The royal family needs her help to uncover the plot against the king. Far away from home, Fire begins to realize there&#8217;s more to her power than she ever dreamed. Her power could save the kingdom.</p>

<p>If only she weren&#8217;t afraid of becoming the monster her father was.</p></blockquote>


<p>[spoilers below]</p>

<p><em>Fire</em> was alright. I liked the strangeness of monsters and their many colors; I liked all the politics, the twist that Fire had killed her own father and the general confusion of royal bloodlines. As in <em><a href="/blog/2013-12-16-graceling/"/>Graceling</a></em>, the non-drama of sexual relationships is a relief. While reading, I hated Archer for being a posessive male character that we are meant to sympathize with; but thinking back, I don&rsquo;t think that his possessive behavior was ever excused by the story&hellip;except, I guess, for Fire&rsquo;s musing about how her innate monster beauty may have compelled Archer to become as horribly possessive as he was. This is uncomfortable because of its similarity to modern &ldquo;victim-blaming&rdquo; narratives, even if <em>Fire</em> explores Fire&rsquo;s strange ability to compel all humans when they look at her, not just men. It&rsquo;s also nice to see a romance not totally typical of YA: a non-virgin woman who falls in love with a man who already has a child.</p>

<p>One downside is that the voice of Fire herself doesn&rsquo;t differ too much from Katsa&rsquo;s in <em>Graceling</em>. Fire feels like a parallel universe Katsa, whose story ultimately isn&rsquo;t as interesting. One of the main reasons I was so attracted to the <em>Graceling</em> was — well — the Graces — and since the Dell doesn&rsquo;t have them, and since Katsa&rsquo;s world doesn&rsquo;t have monsters, this book feels like it&rsquo;s set in an entirely different universe. There&rsquo;s none of the excitement of familiarity, the fun of adding to the breadth and meaning of <em>Graceling</em>&rsquo;s world. The one connection between <em>Graceling</em> and <em>Fire</em> is Leck, but we barely know him from the first book, and I&rsquo;m not interested in any mysteries about how he came to be, since by the end of <em>Graceling</em> he&rsquo;s already dead. Leck&rsquo;s descent into sadism in <em>Fire</em> isn&rsquo;t particularly complex, either; he is shown to be a sociopath from the very beginning, and all interactions that he has with Fire feel tacked on and separate from Fire&rsquo;s own character growth. Had there been more of a commonality with <em>Graceling</em>, <em>Fire</em> would have been more of a hit with me.</p>
