Furthermore, when I encounter a book I dislike, I concede that there are many people who like it, who were searching within it for something that I was not searching for, something that they found and I didn&#8217;t. Why look for the sky in the sea?<br /><br />I want to ~*engage more critically*~ with what I read, however, so&#8230;here I go!<br /><br />First, the cover description:<br /><blockquote><i>The Empyrean is the only home fifteen-year-old Waverly has ever known. Part of the first generation to be successfully conceived in deep space, she and her boyfriend, Kieran, will be pioneers of New Earth. Waverly knows she must marry young in order to have children who can carry on the mission, and Kieran, the handsome captain-to-be, has everything Waverly could want in a husband. Everyone is sure he&#8217;s the best choice. Still, there&#8217;s a part of Waverly that wants more from life than marriage, and she is secretly intrigued by the sky, darkly brilliant Seth.</i><br /><br /><i>Suddenly, Waverly&#8217;s dreams are interrupted by the inconceivable &#8211; a violent betrayal by the Empyrean&#8217;s sister ship, the New Horizon. The New Horizon&#8217;s leaders are desperate to populate the new planet first, and will do anything to get what they need: young girls. In one pivotal moment, Waverly and Kieran are separated, and they find themselves at the helms of dangerous missions, where every move has potentially devastating consequences, and the decisions of the heart may lead to disaster.</i></blockquote>I found this book on the library shelf and thought the premise was interesting enough. I would have said maybe half a year ago that I adore YA, but recently most YA novels have disappointed me in terms of the shallowness with which they engage their issues, and inability to stray from a plot that involves a love triangle.<br /><br />Glow is the first book of a YA trilogy, because YA novels always come in triplets now, I suppose. The story is so fast-paced that there&#8217;s not enough time to learn about anyone. What you do know about people is told to you outright, rather than shown firsthand through character interactions, through things that happen.<br /><br />One of the first characters you are told about is Waverly, through the eyes of Kieran.<br /><blockquote>[Waverly] was a watchful person, and intelligent, a trait that showed in the deliberate way her dark eyes found their mark and held it steady. She had a way of seeing into people and understanding their motives that Kieran found almost unnerving [&#8230;]</blockquote>This description comes right after Kieran asks Waverly to marry him, and comes in lieu of Waverly actually <i>doing</i> any of the things that Kieran says are characteristic of her. When Waverly guesses earlier that Kieran is extending a proposal to her, it isn&#8217;t written like something that she understands with her Waverly-special power. At some point Waverly is &#8220;unreadable in the way she looked at him, waiting, saying nothing,&#8221; which could parallel the way &#8220;her dark eyes found their mark and held it steady&#8221; &#8211; in which case, why not put Kieran&#8217;s observation of her characteristic gaze <i>there</i>, right when the action is happening?<br /><br />Another character is the Captain:<br /><blockquote>In truth, the Captain was the most purposeful man on the ship, quick with his decisions, which were almost always right, and trusted by all the men on the ship, though he was less popular with women.</blockquote>Imagine how much more compelling the Captain character would have been if he was shown in some brief situation with his council or something, and the Captain said, &#8220;Listen, this thing just happened, so we need to do X,&#8221; and the men said, &#8220;Oh my gosh, I must act on your will immediately,&#8221; whereas the women eyed him sidelong and were like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about this.&#8221; You would have learned that the captain was &#8220;trusted by all the men on the ship, though he was less popular with the women,&#8221; with the added bonus of actually seeing it yourself.<br /><br />This is assuming that it&#8217;s ever going to be important that the Captain is less popular with women, which it isn&#8217;t. On page 82 it turns out that Waverly has felt uncomfortable in the male gaze of <i>many</i> men on the ship, which means that the fact that the Captain is unpopular as an individual should be unworthy of note. It just doesn&#8217;t <i>mean anything</i> in the long run.<br /><br />Backstories are also blurted out in solid paragraphs. You&#8217;re handheld through Waverly&#8217;s history with Seth, her second love interest, and with her ex-best-friend Felicity. Maybe the point of the book wasn&#8217;t for Waverly share these experiences firsthand with the reader; but the resulting effect is that these characters are like dolls that are handed to you, rather than &#8220;real people.&#8221;<br /><br />There are also characters that are completely meaningless, like Serafina Mbewe, &#8220;a sweet little girl&#8221; who is deaf. What does it mean that she&#8217;s deaf? Does deafness happen all the time? Did this ship heading for the brand new human world prepare for deaf people? Can Serafina communicate at all? Later, after an announcement by Anne Mathers that the girls&#8217; families are dead, Waverly &#8220;picked up Serafina Mbewe, who was crying&#8221; &#8211; wait, <i>what</i>? Did deaf Serafina hear the announcement? Lipread it? Did Serafina just pick up the distressed atmosphere of the girls around her? Is Serafina just meant to be the token helpless child that shows up to prove that Waverly cares about other people, even if Waverly doesn&#8217;t exhibit any caring by way of worrying about her or thinking about her throughout the book? Serafina is a deaf child amidst a world of not-deaf children, so she sticks out; but she does little to support Waverly&#8217;s character, and doesn&#8217;t do anything to advance the plot.<br /><br />The book&#8217;s premise necessarily involves issues of gender and sex, but the way it treats it is shallow, and in some places cringe-worthy. In a book with so many female characters, it&#8217;s still all about women reacting to men&#8217;s actions and desires. The women of the book are notable for wanting children. And here&#8217;s Waverly, on page 93:<br /><blockquote>Days before, her biggest worry was about marrying Kieran. She should have said yes to him, with no hesitation. <i>Yes, Kieran, I will marry you. I love you.</i> <strong>He needed to hear that, and she should have given it to him.</strong></blockquote>Wait, WHAT?! Waverly &#8211; what about <i>your</i> feelings? Are we seriously reading about something like marriage being something that Waverly should have done to please Kieran? Maybe this is supposed to be an example of Waverly succumbing to men&#8217;s desires, you know, a bad example, something that she rises above &#8211; but, nope. Waverly muses on how Kieran deserved her approval and acceptance of him, despite any (unsaid) feelings she has about him herself, and that&#8217;s that.<br /><br />There are also issues with setting. Waverly has been on a spaceship her entire life. At some point, Waverly describes:<br /><blockquote>Few adults on the Empyrean had been willing to talk about their planet of origin&#8230;. They always changed the subject if she asked too many questions [&#8230;]</blockquote>Which means that what Waverly knows about Earth, or Earth things, likely comes only from the ship&#8217;s environment, or from the classes she&#8217;s taken. Yet, later:<br /><blockquote>&#8220;Have you ever had ice cream?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We don&#8217;t carry cows on the Empyrean,&#8221; Waverly said [&#8230;]</blockquote>Wait, <i>what</i>? Okay, so there are no cows on the Empyrean &#8211; but Waverly knows what a cow <i>is</i>? Even if she had learned about what a cow is, through classes or through an adult&#8217;s hidden past, Waverly not only knows what a cow is, but that milk can be harvested from it, and that milk can be processed to create food products, which includes something called ice cream? Waverly knows all this about a creature which she has never seen personally, and who she really should have no reason to even learn about, since there are no cows on the Empyrean?<br /><br />It&#8217;s an example of the narrowness of this setting despite its uniqueness. How do young characters like Waverly,&nbsp;born on the ship, clash with characters that once lived on Earth? Was the transition from &#8220;I have an entire world to roam&#8221; to &#8220;Now I live on this ship&#8221; made with such ease that no child ever sees an adult struggle with it? (I mean, older people seem to struggle all the time with the ease with which children master iPods and computers.) Is there even amber on the Empyrean for Waverly to use as reference when she describes Kieran&#8217;s eyes as &#8220;amber brown&#8221;? Even if there was, wouldn&#8217;t it be so much cooler if Waverly was like, Wow, Kieran&#8217;s eyes are <i>amber</i>, the color of something that exists on my home planet that I&#8217;ve never seen, which can only be made from the amazing phenomenon of placing tree resin under sustained heat and pressure?<br /><br />Furthermore, certain problems that I expected don&#8217;t crop up at all; for example, didn&#8217;t anyone on this mission ever think about inbreeding? They want to populate an entire new world of humans, yet impregnate dozens of women from the eggs of a couple girls? There&#8217;s not even one note about how bad this could potentially be in the distant future?<br /><br />What I did like about this book was the movement of religion through the characters, and especially the switch-around that happened between the ships and Waverly and Kieran&#8217;s motivations. Given the pace and breadth of characters and setting introduced, however, &#8220;Glow&#8221; really feels like the second of its trilogy, a book that hands over its characters and settings as given, rather than letting them grow.</div>

Thanks! If you do decide to read any, I recommend Kenneth Oppel&#39;s &quot;Matt Cruse&quot; series (is it even YA? Suddenly I&#39;m not sure, but they&#39;re fun), Speak and Wintergirls by Laurie Halse Anderson (which are not fantasy, but deal with sexual assault and anorexia), and The Hunger Games (which is like the poster child of YA right now, especially this new genre of &quot;dystopian trilogy,&quot; haha).</div>

Nice review! Maybe I should read some YA fiction sometime, just to see if I can pick it apart like you have here&#8230; :)</div>
