<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RI85LsClieI/UjesMLwjybI/AAAAAAAAECM/mTlTcUEZGQY/s1600/Upstream_Color_poster.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RI85LsClieI/UjesMLwjybI/AAAAAAAAECM/mTlTcUEZGQY/s1600/Upstream_Color_poster.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_Color">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote>A man and woman are drawn together, entangled in the life cycle of an ageless organism. Identity becomes an illusion as they struggle to assemble the loose fragments of wrecked lives. (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084989/">via</a>)</blockquote><div class="p2">[spoilers]<br /><br /></div><div class="p1">A and I watched <i>Upstream Color </i>this weekend, per the recommendations of various friends and coworkers. As someone on Reddit stated, one great thing about it is that the director does not underestimate the intelligence of his audience. As a viewer, I felt as if I was running to keep up —pausing at one scene with just enough time to grasp at understanding — before rushing on to the next — the next — the next.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">A and I noted some scenes with awe at the "show, don't tell" attention to detail. For example, at some point, the female protagonist says to her love interest, "Let's buy a car," and the next scene shows them driving an old vehicle with the price still painted on the windshield. I found the first "hyponosis" scene awesome for its strangeness, and yet so disturbing that I couldn't bear to watch parts of the protagonist's violation.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I loved that the medium so closely reflects the characters' mental state; the choppiness of the timeline mirrors the difficulty that I imagine they must have had trying to reconstruct their lives after having been so compromised. The story also explores some facets (symptoms?) of the hypnotic state that I enjoyed; for example, once the main characters start telling stories to each other, they begin accepting them as their own, and begin arguing about whose memories actually belong to whom.</div><br /><div class="p1"><i>Upstream Color </i>is great in its focus; it address the exploitation of hypnosis, and the repercussions of it on a human's brain. (Will the victims ever be okay again? What does "okay" even look like anymore?) <i>Upstream Color </i>requires an intellectual athleticism that leaves you a little sore by the end, in a way that's not unpleasant.</div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q0m6jPYOR0U/UXcmxeJsgFI/AAAAAAAADhQ/3DcTLZZuIS4/s1600/220px-O%CC%84kami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki_poster.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q0m6jPYOR0U/UXcmxeJsgFI/AAAAAAAADhQ/3DcTLZZuIS4/s1600/220px-O%CC%84kami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki_poster.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Children">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div>(spoilers)<br /><br />I watched <em>Wolf Children: Ame and Yuki</em> the other day and was taken aback at how I pretty much had tears flowing continuously down my face, starting from the dam scene until the end of the movie . (What is it like to love someone and then see their body thrown into the back of a garbage truck? <em>Oh God</em>)<br /><br />It’s a story that I would be surprised to find in the US, because despite the fact that the title alludes to the wolf-shapeshifting children, the story is just as much about their mother, Hana, and her struggles to raise the children, aided only by her dead partner’s dwindling savings. She learns about natural birth to avoid going to hospitals; she fights off health inspectors; at some point her daughter accidentally ingests detergent and there’s an amusing scene of her rushing off into the night and then glancing desperately back and forth between a children’s hospital and a pet clinic.<br /><br />Though Hana misses her partner, at no point does she ever really find a replacement for him, or need another man at all. Even when she moves into the countryside, she receives assistance from the entire community there (though there is vaguely tsundere old man involved). Though her partner was a wolfman and is the reason why her children are also partially wolves, he just isn’t a part of the equation after he leaves. It sounds simple, but it’s such a relief that there are stories out there about women persevering, doing their own thing against all odds, and ultimately finding a place where they (and their children) can just be themselves.<br /><br />It’s also just a relief to see a woman who isn’t vilified for being a single mother, who isn’t ultimately viewed as lesser and unwhole for her lack of a man, who loses him and continues to move on with her life. Despite what much media would have you believe, without men, women keep existing and struggling towards their own goals.<br /><br />It's true that Hana’s motivations center almost entirely on the health of her children, which on its own isn’t terribly stereotype-breaking, but I appreciated how Hana didn’t lose her personality to become a faceless machine of a mother figure, a character wholly defined by her offspring’s emotions. Her bright attitude could have been unbelievable, but was acceptable to me because it is something established as a defining trait: "Even at my father’s funeral I laughed." And even so, it doesn’t mean she’s perfect: she often admits her ignorance (and remedies it thoroughly researching all her problems), she cries, she bandages her fingers, she panics, and rubs her back when it aches. You also get a glimpse of Hana's life as it was before motherhood, and a little "after," once her children have embarked <br /><br />And now that all of that is said — though <em>Wolf Children</em> impressed me with its focus on Hana as a single mother, after talking about this movie with Heather, I learned that the "virtuous mother" is actually a trope not uncommon in Eastern narratives. I haven't noticed it much, but will definitely be keeping an eye on it from now on.</div>

By the end of the film, Jack's character also undergoes a transformation to solve his problem:&nbsp;<i>My purpose is to share my love of "fun" with children, and now they believe in me. </i>In contrast, Ralph's "transformation" seemed weak and frustrating to me personally; at the beginning he is a character who longs for recognition and acceptance, and at the end becomes happy because he gets...recognition and acceptance. It's just a little boring. It's like a story about someone who says, "You know what I would like? $5." And then that someone meets a princess who gives him $5. The end!</li><li><b>The other primary characters interacted with Jack in ways that helped him with his transformation.</b>&nbsp;Santa teaches Jack the idea of a "center," or something that Jack is <i>all about,</i>&nbsp;which Jack realizes he doesn't know. Tooth teaches Jack that he was someone before he was Jack Frost, and later is an example of how the Guardians have become misaligned with their previous love of caring for children. Bunny is a sort of litmus test for Jack's familiarity with the Guardians, and the Sandman's death was what triggered Jack's supercoldblizzard power (or whatever). The antagonist, Pitch, was also a foil for Jack, representing the "bad side" of wanting to be seen and recognized so badly that you would want children to fear you. In contrast, the interactions between Ralph and characters like Felix and <strike>Jane Lynch</strike> Sergeant Tamora were pretty shallow, and after the Hero's Duty part of the movie, whenever you saw Tamora it was really just for romantic comedy fluff that had nothing to do with the movie's title character.</li><li><b>The Tooth Fairy had her own not-man-related things going on, </b>including but not limited to control of whatever the fairy army is called and a love of gummy, bloody teeth that was amusingly ridiculous. Compare to the Sergeant, whose motivation is hate for the bug-things because they killed her husband (in her fake memories). It's true that Tooth was fangirly about Jack's teeth and all of her fairy minions were swooning over Jack's hoarfrost bangs but I'll take what I can get.</li><li><b>No romance! </b>(Beyond that too-long hug at the end between Tooth and Jack?)&nbsp;Just, thank you for not stuffing that into the movie, especially since it was already bursting its seams with all the fast-paced kingdom-touring and gold particle effects. (On a related note, #rainbowsnowcone and #frostbite seem to be what the shippers are calling Frost/Tooth.)</li></ul><br />There were a couple plot holes in the movie that bothered me somewhat (Why did they only need to round up teeth for one night to save Tooth? After everyone fell asleep in Jamie's room, why were they suddenly in the sleigh, still-sleeping, later?) but I have been reading <i>Wired for Story</i>&nbsp;by Lisa Cron recently, and one of its tenets is that good stories are not about what just events that happen, but about the changes that happen in their characters. I'm not ready to forgive all plot holes for this reason, but it does give me a new lens into what details are the most important in story. In the case of these two movies, Jack's change from the invisible, meaningless delinquent into someone that uses his fun for good is what made him so much more compelling to me, and enjoyable to watch as well.</div>

One of my favorite manga short stories, <i>Hotarubi no Mori e</i>&nbsp;by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Midorikawa">Yuki&nbsp;</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Midorikawa">Midorikawa</a>, was just made into an anime film! I&nbsp;cried after reading the story, and I cried after the&nbsp;animated film ended too. One would think that already&nbsp;knowing the ending would have removed the emotion from&nbsp;the film, but I guess not.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9xC2N3Su410/UIXweCUhwMI/AAAAAAAACq4/dbbR2tLSPQg/s1600/hotarubi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9xC2N3Su410/UIXweCUhwMI/AAAAAAAACq4/dbbR2tLSPQg/s400/hotarubi.jpg" width="282" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">tears everywhere, seriously (<a href="https://minniemeorange.wordpress.com/2012/03/04/anime-movie-review-hotarubi-no-mori-e/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />[spoilers ahead]<br /><br />I haven't read much manga recently, but what stories&nbsp;I've read from Midorikawa still remain glowing in my&nbsp;memory. She always takes a single, strange premise -- <a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=11498">a criminal investigator that can make people do as he says</a>, <a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=6781">a boy who inherits his grandmother's "book of names" of spirits</a> -- and uses story to cast light into the unique possibilities given by that premise, really stretches and shines it out to its full potential.<br /><i><br /></i><i>Hotarubi no&nbsp;</i><i>Mori e</i> in particular is my favorite of hers, because it's so wonderfully concise, whole, and  focused. A human and a spirit meet and become friends, despite a peculiar limitation: if the spirit ever encounters human touch, he will vanish from the world.<br /><br />Significant events and points of growth in the characters' relationship revolve around the problem of contact. When the two first meet, they carry a stick between them to hold hands. One day, when the human falls from a tree, the spirit races to catch her -- before pulling back at the last moment to let her crash. Afterward, she weeps -- "Never touch me, ever!" -- and those different facets of the premise sparkle to light. You understand it without the burden of over-narration; you understand simply, just as it happens. <i>He can't protect her. He can't even comfort her</i>. You watch her sob and sob and the spirit sits close by, face hidden by his mask.<br /><br />When people say that they just <i>had</i>&nbsp;to keep reading/watching/consuming because they want to see what will happen -- this story really dazed me with that desperation. The conflict seems so <i>impossible</i>&nbsp;-- you know what's going to happen, what <i>must</i>&nbsp;happen -- but does it? Is there any other way that this story could end?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and find out! :)</div>

    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2011/09/01/dogs-decoded-nova</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I've been really into dogs recently (it goes with the whole <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/shiba-inu-musings.html">shiba inu thing</a>, I guess), so last night when I found a new documentary on dogs I jumped on it.  I've already watched a couple dog-related documentaries but this one still turned out to have some new information.  For one, the documentary pointed out that human emotions are not distributed evenly across the face.  If you were to split a person's face in half, and then mirror it to itself to get a complete human face, you'd end up getting two faces that have somewhat different "feelings" expressed in them.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W6UVeeNQG1k/Tl-opC3JTCI/AAAAAAAAAY8/pPXobU5YKGA/s1600/rightleft.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="353" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W6UVeeNQG1k/Tl-opC3JTCI/AAAAAAAAAY8/pPXobU5YKGA/s640/rightleft.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">to me, Right seems more confident; Left, benevolent</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There's also a theory that emotions are more faithfully represented in the right side of the face, which is, coincidentally, the side of the face that we as humans tend to look at first when examining a face.  They showed a study which showed this, outlining human gazes with lasers and showing that people generally looked at another person's right eye first, then the left -- but to me this kind of seems typical of how I would look at anything first.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4jjhTZGEbCE/Tl-o2rdlFaI/AAAAAAAAAZE/PNoP9qalNys/s1600/heatmap.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="530" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4jjhTZGEbCE/Tl-o2rdlFaI/AAAAAAAAAZE/PNoP9qalNys/s640/heatmap.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">for example. (<a href="http://www.t3node.com/blog/tiny-introduction-to-heatmaps/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I wonder if this still holds true for humans whose language reads from right to left.  Though, I guess regardless of whether the "leftward gaze" does hold true for humans, it does seem to hold true for dogs, who would also look to the right side of a human's face first.  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hLDQ9b7SEoc/Tl-o7mYOAqI/AAAAAAAAAZM/1z_ZFyI-09A/s1600/dogleft.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hLDQ9b7SEoc/Tl-o7mYOAqI/AAAAAAAAAZM/1z_ZFyI-09A/s640/dogleft.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">puppy dog eyes</td></tr></tbody></table><br />No other animals interact this way with humans, and no other dogs do this with other dogs.  It is almost as if <em>dogs have a special relationship to humans.  Whoa.</em><br /><br />Another special thing that dogs do: bark.  Wolves don't bark at all, but domesticated dogs have a variety of noises, which their owenrs can often interpret as <em>wanting to play</em>, <em>angry I hate strangers!</em>, etc.  In general, people tend to forget on how humans and dogs must have evolved together; in fact, when we think of how humans evolve we tend to look at primates like chimpanzees, but it turns out that chimps, like many other animals, don't understand the human gesture of pointing.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m_Kln1ikwHo/Tl-pACDW2wI/AAAAAAAAAZU/qdnphWcM6z4/s1600/chimppoint.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="356" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m_Kln1ikwHo/Tl-pACDW2wI/AAAAAAAAAZU/qdnphWcM6z4/s640/chimppoint.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wat lol give me food</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Pointing is a human gesture that is informative in nature, and helping someone to get food by pointing is something that seems to be pretty unique to humans/humans or humans/dogs.  Chimps in the wild would apparently never run into a situation where they would point at a banana to indicate its presence to another chimp, though wow, I would be really surprised if this were true.  Still, dogs' ability to read humans is so good that they not only follow pointing, they can follow human <em>gazes</em>.  Human eyes, by the way, are pretty easily followed, what with the white sclera and dark iris, and it may have evolved to be this way because it facilitated better communication.  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LRJ1GdKEpA0/Tl-pEETl7EI/AAAAAAAAAZc/cyv_gTGPB2o/s1600/eyes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="222" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LRJ1GdKEpA0/Tl-pEETl7EI/AAAAAAAAAZc/cyv_gTGPB2o/s400/eyes.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">o___o</td></tr></tbody></table><br />As for the evolution of dogs, genetic testing seems to prove that they undeniably came from wolves, and not any other dog-like creature like coyotes or foxes.  Dogs and wolves can even interbreed; but wolf cubs raised as closely with humans as puppies still don't grow up domesticated.  They don't react to the pointing thing, they aren't interested in hanging out for lols, etc.  So the domestication of dogs is definitely <em>nature</em> versus <em>nuture</em>.  In fact, some people in Russia made up an experiment in which they bred domestication into a species of silver fox, by allowing breeding between foxes only if they were not vicious toward the handlers.  Within six generations, researchers had some really adorable, tame foxes.  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_aeyZhUKHIQ/Tl-pHsY5-iI/AAAAAAAAAZk/NR2eB15DE6E/s1600/tamefox.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_aeyZhUKHIQ/Tl-pHsY5-iI/AAAAAAAAAZk/NR2eB15DE6E/s400/tamefox.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I can hear Tumblr crying out</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Though it turned out, that, the more domesticated silver foxes became...  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L5OMP-H1zPk/Tl-pKpzSWUI/AAAAAAAAAZs/9dj_OUMgZxw/s1600/fluffy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="179" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L5OMP-H1zPk/Tl-pKpzSWUI/AAAAAAAAAZs/9dj_OUMgZxw/s320/fluffy.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">unnff so fluffy</td></tr></tbody></table><br />...the more their physical appearance changed.

I am excited to go back home and stop programming (on others' whims) for a while, though one semi-sad thing I must accept is that I will probably have to wait a while to have a stable living situation and stable amount of money before getting the shiba inu that's been keeping me going all summer. &nbsp;It'll just be too hard to manage rent, tuition, <i>and</i>&nbsp;a dog, at least for a while.</div>

&quot;wat lol give me food&quot; is an impulse that I&#39;m starting to realize is really hard to get rid of in general.  Free food at work all the time == me overeating all the time.  It&#39;s so delicious and so painful</div>
