  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;m in Intro to Human Centered Interaction this quarter and so can&#8217;t help being a little more thoughtful about the way things are designed, especially since I&#8217;m trying to get better at designing myself.  That being said, I&#8217;ve also been working with <a href="http://playerio.com/">Player.IO</a> all weekend, in particular the database-side stuff, and have some good-natured criticisms.<br /><br />Firstly &#8211; <strong>the Player.IO administration area is pretty.</strong> :D<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-07pQuEots34/Tcc9kH2tUfI/AAAAAAAAANM/P1cnKwB0S3I/s1600/nicelayoutbro.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="310" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-07pQuEots34/Tcc9kH2tUfI/AAAAAAAAANM/P1cnKwB0S3I/s640/nicelayoutbro.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">is this really all for me? &lt;3</td></tr></tbody></table><br />At a glance, everything looks very orderly and uncluttered.  Not only that, but the things you presumably want to do when you look at this page &#8211; creating a table, adding a new object to a table, etc. &#8211; are all very apparent.  Player.IO doesn&#8217;t need to provide an intro tutorial for how to use (most of) their UI because the functions it offers are obvious.<br /><br /><strong>The layout also relies a lot on symbols to communicate ideas</strong>, i.e. the green &#8220;plus sign&#8221; for adding an object or adding a property to an object, or the red &#8220;minus sign&#8221; for deleting an object.  Luckily, there&#8217;s alt text to explain what each symbol does, as I can imagine someone could get confused by the difference between &#8220;adding an object&#8221; or &#8220;adding a property to an object,&#8221; especially as they both use some variation of the green plus sign.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nIL2m-A0QiI/Tcc-qlsyVfI/AAAAAAAAANU/wAv9_O7YhY4/s1600/addproperty.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="58" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nIL2m-A0QiI/Tcc-qlsyVfI/AAAAAAAAANU/wAv9_O7YhY4/s640/addproperty.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">why did this computer not take a screencap of the cursor hovering over the green plus sign?<br />the world may never know</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><strong>When you want to change an object&#8217;s property, you just click it.</strong>  There&#8217;s even a helpful &#8220;click to edit&#8221; text which shows whenever your cursor hovers over a property.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cbQT6dvY1yg/Tcc_HyUi85I/AAAAAAAAANc/xdSiKbLDY2s/s1600/itseasyy.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="60" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cbQT6dvY1yg/Tcc_HyUi85I/AAAAAAAAANc/xdSiKbLDY2s/s640/itseasyy.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">it&#8217;s easy!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Once you click a property, you click &#8220;Okay&#8221; and you&#8217;re all done!  <br /><br />&#8230;except, you&#8217;re not. o__o One of the first things I had to get used to was the &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button, which is what you need to press in order to finalize the changes that you&#8217;ve made to an object.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mFy6F-ySW2o/TdtGFefT3nI/AAAAAAAAANk/k4ca8a-Vhws/s1600/itseasyynot.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="90" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mFy6F-ySW2o/TdtGFefT3nI/AAAAAAAAANk/k4ca8a-Vhws/s640/itseasyynot.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">aaack</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The main reason why this is so easy to forget is because, other than the appearance of the button, <strong>there&#8217;s no real visible indication that an object is &#8220;dirty&#8221; or has been altered and needs to be saved</strong>; and once you click &#8220;Save Changes,&#8221; the only indication that you have of success is the &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button disappearing, which just doesn&#8217;t feel affirming.  It&#8217;s like &#8211; were the changes saved?  Did they fail?  Can I leave now?<br /><br /><strong>Saving your data is so subtle and anti-climatic that it&#8217;s easy to forget to do it.</strong><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Md8qEM6FCQA/TdtLM5kjjCI/AAAAAAAAAN8/ZzA-sMsvkXo/s1600/waitwhatno.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Md8qEM6FCQA/TdtLM5kjjCI/AAAAAAAAAN8/ZzA-sMsvkXo/s640/waitwhatno.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wait &#8211; wh &#8211; nooooooooo</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then again, maybe the &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button is the way it is because input fields to change properties opens whenever you click on a property, whether you actually wanted to change that property or not.  The only way to close out of changing a property once this happens is to say either say &#8220;okay&#8221; or &#8220;Delete.&#8221; That being said, putting more prominence in the form of a confirmation message to the &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button would probably make more sense than making the &#8220;Okay&#8221; button a &#8220;Cancel&#8221; button to close input-listening.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cbQT6dvY1yg/Tcc_HyUi85I/AAAAAAAAANc/xdSiKbLDY2s/s1600/itseasyy.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="60" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cbQT6dvY1yg/Tcc_HyUi85I/AAAAAAAAANc/xdSiKbLDY2s/s640/itseasyy.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">even if you accidentally open this input field,<br />&#8220;Okay&#8221; and &#8220;Delete&#8221;&nbsp;make more sense<br />than &#8220;Cancel&#8221; and &#8220;Delete,&#8221; i suppose</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A related issue: <strong>if you happen to click on an object or an array accidentally, that object or array gets emptied of all its data</strong>.  Since no alteration you make to a property gets saved until you press &#8220;Save Changes,&#8221; at least it&#8217;s not a permanent emptiness; but, there&#8217;s no way to undo this object/array-emptying, so to undo you need to refresh the object completely.  This can be frustrating if you&#8217;ve made a lot of changes to other properties in the object, and now need to cancel all those changes just to get your emptied-out object/array back.<br /><br />Speaking of arrays, <strong>it took me forever to figure out how to add an array property to an object</strong>.  It turns out that this is the proper way to do it:<br /><br /><ol><li>In your object, press &#8220;+&#8221; to create a new property.</li><li>Set the new property&#8217;s value to &#8220;Value is: Array.&#8221;</li><li>Press &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</li><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cr-B_t0nEws/TdtMgmyrxNI/AAAAAAAAAOE/yRGeJ8foqyU/s1600/openthatarraybro.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="68" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cr-B_t0nEws/TdtMgmyrxNI/AAAAAAAAAOE/yRGeJ8foqyU/s640/openthatarraybro.png" width="640" /></a></div><li>You&#8217;ll see something like the image above.  Click &#8220;Show array.&#8221;</li><li>Add properties to the array one by one by clicking &#8220;+&#8221;.</li></ol><br />This is a pretty roundabout method, considering that to make a value of a property an int, all you need to do is put an int in the field, then say &#8220;Okay.&#8221;  When trying to put in an array, I was expecting to somehow form my input so that the values would get fed into the array automatically.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GDEP6-4WlYE/TdtItydaogI/AAAAAAAAANs/BqaI9yop1iE/s1600/inputarrayvalues.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="88" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GDEP6-4WlYE/TdtItydaogI/AAAAAAAAANs/BqaI9yop1iE/s640/inputarrayvalues.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />It&#8217;s also annoying that you have to click &#8220;Show array&#8221; before adding properties to it; it would be nice if the entire array just popped open when you went to add a property to it, since that&#8217;s probably what you&#8217;re going to do if you&#8217;re clicking an array in the first place.  Clicking anywhere in that row outside of &#8220;show array&#8221; will just bring you back to the weird input box right above &#8220;Value is: Array.&#8221; This is one case in which the &#8220;+&#8221; button for adding properties is unhelpfully small. (And of course, if you miss it and accidentally click somewhere, your entire array gets emptied, as I mentioned above.)<br /><br />Anyway, when I was making this example, I noticed <strong>Player.IO does a good job of telling you when your fields are malformed</strong>.  It might be marginally nicer to put some error message like, &#8220;This field needs an int in it, because that&#8217;s what you said duh&#8221; but I don&#8217;t know; maybe that would mess up the minimalism.  Then again, minimalist aesthetic should be about only giving you the information you need, right?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YYD3xF1d2lU/TdtKb9qaeOI/AAAAAAAAAN0/tZRyuNqhUD4/s1600/inputxpvaluesgooderror.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="86" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YYD3xF1d2lU/TdtKb9qaeOI/AAAAAAAAAN0/tZRyuNqhUD4/s640/inputxpvaluesgooderror.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />Another miscellaneous issue: <strong>you can&#8217;t do batch alterations/deletions of objects.</strong> When I go through and cleanse all my test accounts and related information, I have to delete every single object by hand, rather than just selecting them all and deleting them in a fell swoop.  Time-consuming and annoying.<br /><br />All this being said, working with Player.IO has still been tons of fun.  I would have had no idea how to implement all this back-end stuff by myself &#8211; or at the very least, it would have taken me much longer to figure out how to do.</div>

Before it was just a dense cluster of Country Homes, which are the first tier of housing that you can buy, and thus is the building that is presently the most useless to me.  I need more population in less space!  But something about bulldozing houses for Milan Apartments or Upscale Condos is a little uncomfortable.<br /><br />My most recent additions to the city of Tummy are a cheese store and a candle shop, which are named Tummy and Whey, and The Tummy At Both Ends, respectively.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />Last week or so I attended the first <a href="https://convore.com/seattle-indies/info/">Seattle [Game Dev] Indies meetup</a> at The Capitol Club, which I walked past twice before actually discovering.  Though I cannot comfortably call myself an &#8220;indie&#8221; game dev (unless you count my research projects and the burgeoning Get Across), I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what my place was, but in general just wanted to learn more about the community and see what new experiences I could make.  Everyone was nice (though some were understandably horrified that I have not yet played Portal 2, nay, have not even played the first Portal), even <a href="https://twitter.com/danctheduck">Dan</a> for some reason remembered me from my stint helping him take surveys for his game two years ago, and I was super happy to run into <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/">Alex</a> again.  I learned about the tragedy of <a href="http://thesiteformerlyknownas.zachtronicsindustries.com/?p=713">Infiniminer</a>, that a lot of people are making abstract music games, that <a href="http://flixel.org/">Flixel</a> is much more widely used than I thought, that <a href="http://playerio.com/">Player.IO</a> really <em>is</em> the way to go for multiplayer Flash games, which is good, because we finally finished paper prototyping stage and started coding Get Across.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-chd51p9HCUE/TcWGkCvpGuI/AAAAAAAAAM0/iGuChDQnJeo/s1600/playerio.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="74" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-chd51p9HCUE/TcWGkCvpGuI/AAAAAAAAAM0/iGuChDQnJeo/s320/playerio.gif" width="199" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">you the bestest</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Working with Player.IO has been really simple and fun, though it&#8217;s taking a while for me to wrap my head around noSQL and the whole &#8220;We don&#8217;t have rows, we have objects!&#8221; thing.  I want to learn more about noSQL.  Is it faster than relational databases?  IS it still a relational databases?!  Somehow an initial Google search was fruitless.<br /><br />Some advantages of Player.IO:<br /><ul><li>I would have had no idea how to implement network stuff otherwise, and the given code and examples make it relatively easy</li><li>GUI is really nice!</li><li>I can view every item in my database and alter each one? &nbsp;Wat!</li><li>Database queries are all asynchronous, which makes them fast</li></ul><br />And some problems we&#8217;ve run into:<br /><ul><li>There are three people in our team, and when we are all working together, one of us will sometimes hang at the &#8220;joining a room&#8221; dialogue</li><li>Running into vague &#8220;InternalError&#8221; problems when loading/updating the database is a pain&#8230;nothing to do for it but wait until something works all of a sudden :/</li><li>Database queries are all asynchronous, which makes it so I get results back at weird/wrong times</li></ul><br />Not deal-breakers overall, and I&#8217;m getting more and excited.

The last one, around St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, was Green Mocha Cake, and the new one is Candied Carnations, for Mother&#8217;s Day. (There&#8217;s actually a whole slew of Mother&#8217;s Day-themed offerings &#8211; way to play it out to dat hardcore Zynga gamer mothers, haha.)<br /><br />Anyway, apparently when Francine bought one of my surplus Mocha Cakes, I got my Candied Carnation recipe leveled up instead.  Which begs the question &#8211; which was she really buying?  Does the mastery gained from a special recipe that was discontinued just go to whatever the &#8220;present special recipe&#8221; is, if there is one? (I know before when people bought my Mocha Cakes, it leveled up the Mocha Cake, which was nice since, you know, it&#8217;s not like I could level it up myself anymore.)  How does the English FarmVille fit into this equation, now that it has its own special recipe?<br /><br />All these answers and more, maybe this summer. :)</div>

I have to say that when I was making this video, I was impressed by the sheer scale of the reconstruction, and how it&#8217;s even possible to do something like this now just by using pictures.  It&#8217;s even pretty much got the distances in between the buildings.</div>

<br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9CpaPPefPOY" title="YouTube video player" width="510"></iframe></center><br /><br /><b>Edit 11/29: </b>Links to photo galleries can be found in <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/sakura-con-2011-cosplay-photos.html">this post</a>!<br /><br />This is a video Timmy found on Youtube by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CpaPPefPOY&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=88">FastMatt</a> which is essentially the only proof (1:27) that I have of cosplaying at this year&#8217;s Con. (Actually, there are a couple pictures, but I&#8217;m kind of dissatisfied with them, and didn&#8217;t really have a chance to take pictures of myself&#8230;) I did Glaceon and &#8211; oh gosh, I just realized I left my costume at the Convention Center&#8230;<br /><br />&#8230;.<br /><br />&#8230;well, it wasn&#8217;t that hard to make. &gt;____&gt;;; It was basically a light blue kimono and some darker portions made with darker blue, all in this sort of quilt fabric that I found at JoAnn&#8217;s. (Quilt fabric is always in much more versatile colors&#8230;) Since I&#8217;ve made gi/kimono-style clothings at least twice before for Con purposes I pretty much just haphazardly threw it together, yet I feel that it&#8217;s my most successful cosplay yet.  Probably because I was with all the other Eevees, and I think we made up a pretty impressive gijinka group. :3<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iFSxbqhfPU4/Tbe03Tey_5I/AAAAAAAAAMc/SpjikTGFJEg/s1600/209229_2037154807629_1206997758_2461459_6895401_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iFSxbqhfPU4/Tbe03Tey_5I/AAAAAAAAAMc/SpjikTGFJEg/s640/209229_2037154807629_1206997758_2461459_6895401_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is kind of an unflattering picture of me, but a good one of everyone else :D</td></tr></tbody></table><br />We had more pro pictures taken by <a href="http://masa-kocha.deviantart.com/">Rachel</a>, an apparently amazing artist and cosplayer from San Francisco who does photography as a hobby.  She&#8217;s uber busy though, so it will probably take a couple months for us to actually get the pictures that she took of us.  (Apparently she&#8217;s putting off photo processing until early June!  Just enough time to forget about them and then be happy to see them later. :D) We scrambled over the stone features of the Washington State Convention Center and afterwards shivered in turns as we waited for Eric to finish taking individual shots of all of us.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wKE3LTKlEVU/Tbe1qzPuf4I/AAAAAAAAAMk/fRD8ct7OVFU/s1600/27041_895203577798_10739505_49066831_899936_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wKE3LTKlEVU/Tbe1qzPuf4I/AAAAAAAAAMk/fRD8ct7OVFU/s400/27041_895203577798_10739505_49066831_899936_n.jpg" width="278" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is a pic that rachel took of some other of merch staff cosplaying blazblue at last year&#8217;s con<br />&#8230;for the sake of having a picture here</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was busier at this Con than any other year before, mostly because of commitments as staff, and a lesser willingness to get up early and take advantage of wandering Con in the morning.  FFXIII and Vocaloid cosplays seemed to be especially popular, or at least, that&#8217;s what I remember the most, aside from the usual smattering of Akatsuki cloaks, and an interesting blend of different video games, including Minecraft, haha.  Also, tons of Hetalia.<br /><br />My favorite thing to do at Con is usually take pictures, but this year I found I wasn&#8217;t quite so interested in wandering and asking cosplayers for their pictures&#8230;maybe because I&#8217;ve become too jaded, or maybe because I&#8217;m just tired of the process itself.  For me the joy of Con now comes mostly just from submerging myself in the atmosphere of it &#8211; the excited fanpeoples, the cosplayers who have worked so hard, the shy people who come out all smooth and soft-spoken from their quiet shells from all corners of Seattle and beyond.<br /><br />It used to be that I would also go for all the stuff you could buy, but I guess I&#8217;ve grown out of that too &#8211; just &#8211; can&#8217;t think of anything to buy.  That being said, I never used to enjoy Artist Alley, but I think I&#8217;ve finally decided that it&#8217;s another one of my favorite parts of Con &#8211; being there has such a clean, nice, inspiring feeling, unlike being in the general dealer&#8217;s room.  I bought a beautiful print from Zilva and a poster for Andou from Han Tseng, from <a href="http://directionsofdestiny.com/">Directions of Destiny</a> (which I started reading <em>soooo long ago!</em> Guess it&#8217;s time to check up on it again).  I actually grabbed the poster on Sunday; I went back home for Easter celebrations and then rushed from the terminal to fifth floor, where I located Han Tseng&#8217;s booth, already 90% taken down&#8230;luckily he was nice enough to pull out a poster for me despite.<br /><br />Also this year at Con, I had my picture taken by a DSi for the first time. I wonder what I would have thought of such a thing back when I started attending in 2006&#8230;that handhelds and cellphones have become common cameras is just crazy.<br /><br />So, in summary: Con was great!  Can&#8217;t wait for the next one. :D</div>

It swerves dangerously close to racist statements sometimes (&#8220;the French language&#8230;romantic and <em>spirituel</em> but also, of course, the paragon of logic and clarity;&#8221; sure, but have you really studied other languages, or is this whole book going to be European-centric?), but the tone is pretty subjective and the discussion (at least for now) goes deeper than pure labeling.  <span class="shh">And at some point he mentioned Tagalog, which made me really happy :D :D It&#8217;s always a shock when I learn non-Filipino know Tagalog people &#8211; even now, it&#8217;s like, <em>Why?</em> Derek once explained to me that he thinks Japanese people feel the same way, which is why they were always so shocked when we showed up all Nihongo.  <em>Why would you bother learning Japanese?!</em></span><br /><br />Anyway, the most interesting part thus far talks about this guy named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>, who was eloquent but not considered completely sane by his contemporaries due to his fervored attempts to connect the Greek pantheon to Christian religious figures.  In reading Homer&#8217;s works, he realized that Homer has a strange treatment of color: he hardly uses it.  Example: for almost anyone, the sea is blue.  But to Homer it is &#8220;wine-looking&#8221; &#8211; just as oxen are.  And just as iron is.  But his treatment of color is also inconsistent:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;Iron&#8230;is said to be &#8216;violet&#8217; in one passage, &#8216;gray&#8217; elsewhere, and in yet another place it is referred to as <em>aithon</em>, a term otherwise used to refer to the color of horses, lions, and oxen.&#8221;</blockquote><br />It turns out the key is in the fact that Homer references &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;white&#8221; 270 times, whereas the references to other colors put together is hardly anything.<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;He may often talk about light and brightness, but seldom does he venture beyond gray scale into the splendor of prism.  In those instances when colors are mentioned, they are often vague and highly inconsistent: his sea is wine-colored, and when not wine-colored, it is violet, just like his sheep.  His honey is green and his southern sky is anything but blue&#8230;.&#8221;</blockquote><br />And that&#8217;s the key, I guess: Homer saw the world not so much in colors as they did in lightnesses and darknesses.  The rest of the Greeks did as well, since &#8220;violet-colored hair&#8221; is seen in other Greek poetry in ancient times.<br /><br />As it turns out, the world for green, <em>chloros</em>, has an etymology which links it to &#8220;young herbage,&#8221; a fresh light green; and if you think of <em>chloros</em> as meaning more &#8220;light&#8221; than &#8220;green,&#8221; then &#8220;green honey&#8221; is really just &#8220;pale, bright honey.&#8221;  By extension, faces &#8220;green with disgust&#8221; may actually be &#8220;pale with disgust.&#8221;<br /><br />AND THAT&#8217;S WHY I WROTE THIS POST.  BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT OUR COMMONLY USED TERM, &#8220;[WHATEVER]&#8217;S FACE TURNED GREEN,&#8221; DOES NOT ACTUALLY MEAN THAT IT TURNED GREEN, BUT HAS A CONNECTION TO THE ANCIENT LACK OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE COLOR GREEN AND PALENESS <span class="shh">(maybe)</span>.<br /><br />As for &#8220;the ancient lack of blue&#8221; &#8211; I guess Goldstone&#8217;s theory is that humanity only grew to have a vivid appreciation of color when color started to matter, i.e. when artificial dyes started to become easy to come by.  Ancient Greek (and ancient Indian languages, despite their praising of T3h Heavens) lack a word for &#8220;blue.&#8221;<br /><br />And I guess perceptions of color are even changing <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/4013694698/datchan-on-the-issues-the-changing-standards-of">in more recent times</a>.<br /><br />Anyway, faces green/pale with disgust.  That&#8217;s all.</div>

I feel like I can see new stories rising at every line and edge.<br /><br />For our introductory game using the <a href="http://heartrategames.com/">HeartRate Games</a> API that I helped to create, we&#8217;re building a really simple game involving bunnies and monsters (both arbitrarily chosen during brainstorming), where bunnies are things to be chased and monsters are things to be crushed at high velocity.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4WL8NEf6E0E/TaulAVabpXI/AAAAAAAAAL8/kSWXBjWDzw4/s1600/DSC_0375.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4WL8NEf6E0E/TaulAVabpXI/AAAAAAAAAL8/kSWXBjWDzw4/s640/DSC_0375.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><br />To learn Unity in the first place, Mari and I read through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unity-Game-Development-Essentials-Goldstone/dp/184719818X">Unity Game Development Essentials</a>, which was a pretty good primer, though it&#8217;s hard for me to remember some of the tutorials now that I&#8217;m trying to work through things on my own.  I think that&#8217;s more a fault of the fact that I&#8217;ve never done game development, really, much less much manipulation of 3d objects.  In our Computer Graphics class it was all C++, compile, see if your shadows rendered properly, change stuff, compile again.<br /><br />Anyway, the basics I know of Unity should be enough to implement a basic skeleton of a game, more as a proof of concept than anything polished and pretty.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aZRyFlgj0ek/TaukuK2N3mI/AAAAAAAAAL0/wYT4Lr-cZjI/s1600/DSC_0377.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aZRyFlgj0ek/TaukuK2N3mI/AAAAAAAAAL0/wYT4Lr-cZjI/s640/DSC_0377.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dat skeleton</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It&#8217;s a shame that we won&#8217;t be able to do something uber-fancy, but there&#8217;s definitely not enough time in eight weeks, amidst my other classes, to do anything else. D: In particular we were brainstorming various challenges to an exercise game, and came up with some &#8211;<br /><br /><ul><li>How do you make an exercise game engaging all the way through, so people don&#8217;t get bored in the middle?</li><li>How can you make sure people can rest when they&#8217;re tired and not get too penalized?</li><li>How can you even force people to rest during long stretches of exercise?</li><li>When people go up to a stationary bike at the gym, they may just be concerned with exercising for a period of time; so how do you time a game and make sure that people can finish a round in 20 minutes or 30 minutes, and feel satisfied?</li></ul><br />Thus, bunnies and monsters. &nbsp;Our bunnies are the main incentive &#8211; they speed up when players need to speed up &#8211; and monsters to be defeated can have constraints on their vanquishing, which in turn puts constrains on a user&#8217;s action. &nbsp;One monster could require speeding up very fast momentarily to flatten it; another maybe could be unbeatable, and thus can only be dealt with by sneaking past it, slowly, or at a constant heart rate.<br /><br />We were also exploring different ways that we could use a game to guide people through proper warming up, then exercise, then cooling down, through different stages of a level.  What I mostly want to do is make it so that an exercise game is capable of educating people about exercise, which is something I feel I never really received properly; for example, you&#8217;re told in your P.E. class that it&#8217;s good to warm up and cool down, but why, exactly?  What&#8217;s the difference between diastolic and systolic blood pressure?  What&#8217;s their proper ranges, and what does it mean if their numbers are too high or too low?<br /><br />Nowadays you could just Google this information, but learning it in the context of exercising would be more fun, I think.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So a couple of days ago I attended <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/technologybrierdudleysblog/2014767469_zynga_launches_seattleville_be.html">the launch of Zynga&#8217;s Seattle office</a>.  It was pretty delicious; I guess Zynga has their own pomegranate martini with Pop Rocks in it.  They sank to the bottom though and become saturated with t3h alcohols pretty quickly.  My other favorite food was this sort of fried wonton with the most melty sashimi in it, which came with a sort of guacamole-with-edamame substance.  Also present: hand-made marshmallows dipped in chocolate and covered in nuts and thinly sliced almonds.<br /><br />I went with David and Fransiskus and we all managed to get pictures with Mark Pincus XD<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X94S1A0OyYk/TaoFcg39kjI/AAAAAAAAALM/2cX_OsjL8G4/s1600/photo.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X94S1A0OyYk/TaoFcg39kjI/AAAAAAAAALM/2cX_OsjL8G4/s320/photo.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">and then he went off to mingle elsewhere</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then we chatted with some of the other engineers at the event, who all seemed to be peripheral to games in some way &#8211; I even saw the guy who gave the original concept for <a href="http://heartrategames.com/">one of my research projects</a>.  Mostly I was pretty hyped to get Zynga-world money, which we did end up getting at the very end in a gift bag, along with a nifty thermos.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NzqAbYNCcdM/TaoHnkqJOxI/AAAAAAAAALU/F2A-SnJaRrA/s1600/DSC_0390.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NzqAbYNCcdM/TaoHnkqJOxI/AAAAAAAAALU/F2A-SnJaRrA/s320/DSC_0390.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">swag, yeeee</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then, because David and Fransiskus like it so much, I started playing CityVille.  Which has actually turned out to be really fun o___o I&#8217;ve already been playing <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/02/okay-dude-so-planting-nachos-is.html">FarmVille</a> for a while, and I started FrontierVille because of hearing the Civilization designer created it, but CityVille strikes a perfect balance in between them.  I like the clean artwork and the little people that wave at you and the general friendliness of the whole thing.  The sound effects for when you pick up different resources are also really happy-inducing somehow.  For seriose.  They&#8217;re on par with Zelda SFX for uncovering mystery doors and opening treasure chests.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n_pMrKX-Dxk/TaoIAi5v67I/AAAAAAAAALc/yb0iVhSjdU8/s1600/cityville.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="249" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n_pMrKX-Dxk/TaoIAi5v67I/AAAAAAAAALc/yb0iVhSjdU8/s320/cityville.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so many things to click and feel productive with &lt;3</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Though, I guess a Zynga game is also much more fun definitively if you have a ton of people to play it with, unlike in FrontierVille, where I desperately keep posting requests for Juicy Berries and Critter Milk and have been getting no response.  There have been shy and sick baby creatures on my homestead for months.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-owd_CkgAro4/TaoJ4CfgVII/AAAAAAAAALk/sx-86Dv4v3M/s1600/frontierville.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="257" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-owd_CkgAro4/TaoJ4CfgVII/AAAAAAAAALk/sx-86Dv4v3M/s320/frontierville.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">none of you are ever getting help. &nbsp;ever</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I definitely want to incorporate the &#8220;popping out of things&#8221; like coins and XP in Get Across too, maybe so that when you move onto a tile or something you get rewarded with little coins and bits.  I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s too much of a &#8220;casual&#8221; mechanic that will end up turning people off, though&#8230;I guess for now we&#8217;ll put it off into an advanced feature.</div>

I looked for Youtube videos and then just decided to download an emulator.  It&#8217;s quite fun. :D<br /><br /><span class="shh">It&#8217;s amazing how much you can feel for the fate of a couple pixels.</span></div>
