Now award-winning author Mark Kurlansky tells the remarkable story of New York by following the trajectory of one of its most fascinating inhabitants &#8211; the oyster, whose influence on the great metropolis remains unparalleled.<br /><br />For centuries New York was famous for its oysters, which until the early 1900s played such a dominant role in the city&#8217;s economy, gastronomy, and ecology that the abundant bivalves were Gotham&#8217;s most celebrated export, a staple food for the wealthy, the poor, and tourists alike, and the primary natural defense against pollution for the city&#8217;s congested waterways.<br /><br />Filled with cultural, historical, and culinary insight &#8211; along with historic recipes, maps, drawings, and photos &#8211; this dynamic narrative sweeps readers from the island hunting ground of the Lenape Indians to the death of the oyster beds at the rise of America&#8217;s environmentalist movement, from the oyster cellars of the rough-and-tumble Five Points slums to Manhattan&#8217;s poshest Gilded Age dining chambers.</i></blockquote><br />Reading history in general is a lot more palatable to me when it anchors itself on a single thing, especially if that thing is a food item (haha?). As such, I picked up&nbsp;<i>The Big Oyster:</i>&nbsp;a history of New York that revolves around a bivalve that apparently was once so populous there that people were like, &#8220;Oh, well, if poor people can&#8217;t afford to buy food, at least they can just dredge up oysters to eat!&#8221;<br /><br />It&#8217;s a book that made me wince at every page with the sheer amount of environmental pollution that people are willing to inflict on their environments, especially when the feedback of such destructive actions isn&#8217;t clear enough (like if all your sewage sinks into the bay, below sight&#8230;and right on the oyster beds). Consider &#8220;the Collect:&#8221;<br /><br /><blockquote><i>This pond where the Lenape [Native Americans] once fished, where the Dutch picnicked on an adjacent hill to have a view of it, was becoming a mucky, malarial swamp, strewn with trash and festering with disease.</i></blockquote><br />Or the quality of water in Manhattan:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Also, the city was running out of fresh water. The drinking water came from local wells that caught the rainwater that washed down the foul streets. By midcentury, the quality of Manhattan water had become so bad that out-of-town horses refused to drink it.</i></blockquote><br />Or what happened after the American Revolution:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Discarded trash would start to fill in around the piers and merchants, rather than cleaning it out, would extend the docks farther out and finish filling in the trash area with landfill until they had added several blocks to lower Manhattan at the expense of the East River, the harbor, and the Hudson.</i></blockquote><br />AAAAHHHH ;____;<br /><br />Something else that I appreciated about the book was that it didn&#8217;t stick strictly to the history of white settlers to New York, but also discussed the activities of people of color.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The first black in Manhattan was an explorer named Jan Rodrigues who came on a Dutch ship in 1613 [&#8230;] By the 1630s, a free black community had been established north of the pond. By 1750, Manhattan was 18 percent black, comparable to today&#8217;s ratio.</i></blockquote><br />And, did you know about Thomas Downing, who owned the Downing&#8217;s restaurant from 1830 to 1860, New York&#8217;s &#8220;most celebrated oyster cellar,&#8221; which catered Charles Dickens&#8217; visit to the United States? Downing also sent oysters to Queen Victoria, which she repaid by giving him a gold watch. Pretty cooool.<br /><br />There&#8217;s also notes made of women; here&#8217;s one concerning the opening of the Delmonica cafe, around 1824:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>For Americans, the initial curiosity of was the first female cashier they had ever seen, a new concept, entrusting women with money.</i></blockquote><br />That&#8217;s less than <i>200 years ago</i>. Also happening around this time: not women, but men doing grocery shopping and bringing the bags home. Because, as one man put it, &#8220;The man who was ashamed to carry home his dinner didn&#8217;t deserve any.&#8221; (Also, I guess men could more easily wade through the filth of the marketplaces, as they are socialized to wear trousers rather than long dresses. See how sexism hurts everybody?)<br /><br />There are, of course, a fair share of interesting oyster tidbits:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Producers discovered that oysters are educable. The grower would choose plump, large oysters and replant them closer to shore where they would be exposed for a few hours a day in low tide. After a few days, they would move the oysters a little farther up so that they were exposed for a few minutes longer in low tides. [&#8230;] The oysters learned to take a long hard drink before the water retreated and eventually would hold the water the entire time they were exposed.</i></blockquote>In conclusion: fun, easy to read, informative, inclusive.</div>
