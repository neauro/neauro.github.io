  <h3>"Napster X"</h3>
  <p>
  At Napster, I was part of the product team responsible for defining a new music streaming product, titled "Napster X."</p>
  
  <p>For this project, I created and owned a user testing process for vetting concepts and features via in-person studies, remote testing, and surveys. Over the course of the project we surveyed thousands of people and talked weekly face-to-face with over a hundred users in our target demographic.

  <h3>Process</h3>

  After I created initial sketches, I would discuss with our product team. Together we would propose questions to investigate about a feature, as well as hypotheses that would be targeted for user testing.

  For prototype creation, I used paper and pencil, as well as Proto.io, Sketch, and Pixate.

  I summarized research findings and design recommendations for company-wide distribution. Once iterations provided a design that would best help us learn about our goals and KPIs, I defined technical requirements for features to hand off to development.

  <h3>Microtransactions</h3>
  <p>With routine and thorough user testing, I cracked one of the major design problems of the Napster X product, which involved the use of microtransactions. Rather than paying a monthly subscription to an app, users would use credits to listen to music. We iterated through various designs and presensations for microtransactions, and turned a system that users hated into one that they were excited to interact with.</p>

 <h3>Participant Feedback</h3>
 <strong>While iterating on microtransactions design</strong>
 <blockquote>
   “I don’t really like the credit aspect. SoundCloud is great because it doesn’t charge you to play music.”
 </blockquote>

 <blockquote>
   “[If I saw this design, my reaction would be:] No thanks, then remove the app, then go back to Spotify. I’m not interested in the whole idea of credits. I can already listen to free music and make playlists from different apps so I’m not sure why I would stay.”
 </blockquote>

 <blockquote>
   “If you had to constantly change the song, or decide what credits to use, that would get in the way. Managing credits gets in the way of the music.”
 </blockquote>

  <strong>With improved microtransactions design</strong>
  <blockquote>
    “It is free and you can earn credits to skip ads. It is perfect for someone who doesn't have a lot of money.”
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    “I hate ads and I like having the ability to not listen to them without having to pay each month for that privilege.”
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    “[The way credits work in this app] seems a more comprehensive and convenient plan compared to the alternatives.”
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    “The idea of earning credits sounds kind of fun....I think the concept [credits in this app] is really cool.”
  </blockquote>
