At Fugazo, I was hired initially to design a hidden object game. I've made a couple of posts about&nbsp;<a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search?q=hidden+object">this type of game</a>, but never talked about mine, which was going to be a fantastical version a la <a href="http://www.boomzap.com/">Boomzap</a>'s <i>Awakening</i> series, which would hopefully shine in a market saturated with grimy amusement parks and children being stolen and dangled off cliff-ledges by evil wizards.<br /><br />The premise of the story was that a village had had its special crown stolen by a thief, who wanted it for a queen in a distant land, who in turn wanted it so she could look cool at parties. The crown was a symbol of the ancient pact the village had with the elements, and upon its disappearance havoc arose: cookfires burst, water slid away from mouths and flasks, the air blew cold, stones rolled across the feet of weary villagers, etc.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YtmP55ls_xA/UAN1Xkcy1CI/AAAAAAAABqs/WjAqz6RtxtQ/s1600/elements+map+3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="481" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YtmP55ls_xA/UAN1Xkcy1CI/AAAAAAAABqs/WjAqz6RtxtQ/s640/elements+map+3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a sketch of the world map;<br />the big part is the temple, the bottom-left part the village</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The elemental avatars were housed in a temple with four quarters on some massive landmass overlooking the village. Wanting to set things straight, the villagers send a girl to temple to make peace, and she ventures bravely despite the fact that avatars are known to turn annoying trespassers into statues or sparrows or whatever else pleases them. Upon arriving at the temple, the girl runs into a talking hawk, who aids her in her quest with dry banter and the occasional vague StarCraft reference. ("You need more crystals! ...to finish this mini-game")<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c-L6g8ERer0/UAOpUQ1fCiI/AAAAAAAABsE/PW2TzcL9s_s/s1600/elements+dragon.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c-L6g8ERer0/UAOpUQ1fCiI/AAAAAAAABsE/PW2TzcL9s_s/s640/elements+dragon.jpg" width="584" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the avatar of the fire temple, a kind of fuzzy dragoness</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In the end, it turns out that the hawk has been the thief all along; he had been turned into a hawk as punishment for getting lost and rummaging around the sacred temple. At the conclusion of the game, an epic match-three-kinda mini-game ensues in which the girl/you defeat him and win the crown back.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time playing other games for ideas on mini-games, and prototyping them out on paper, and testing them against coworkers.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1ZQsf6z184g/UAN4jKVzGbI/AAAAAAAABrA/t4dbVRs3tpA/s1600/c1d4510e072011e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1ZQsf6z184g/UAN4jKVzGbI/AAAAAAAABrA/t4dbVRs3tpA/s320/c1d4510e072011e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a photo of a paper prototype inspired by UW's <a href="http://games.cs.washington.edu/Refraction/refraction.html">Refraction</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also spent a non-negligible amount of time outlining the various areas of the temple in a composition notebook, which I filled to the margins with cheap ballpoint ink (as it is a favorite tool of mine, beside Steadler mechanical pencils).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6xHGGSMHnWE/UAN395Irb3I/AAAAAAAABq4/oLIc7ojXnkc/s1600/elements+earth+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="408" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6xHGGSMHnWE/UAN395Irb3I/AAAAAAAABq4/oLIc7ojXnkc/s640/elements+earth+temple.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(page 1/2) a scan of my sketchbook with various areas drawn out for the "earth temple"</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l9XshfoY4Tk/UAOq_xYyZBI/AAAAAAAABsM/CE3zetuT_Hs/s1600/elements+forest.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="415" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l9XshfoY4Tk/UAOq_xYyZBI/AAAAAAAABsM/CE3zetuT_Hs/s640/elements+forest.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(page 2/2) a scan of my sketchbook with various areas drawn out for the "earth temple" </td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also laid out certain rooms and angles for detail and fun.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--x7SzByFqJ8/UAN50iElStI/AAAAAAAABrI/l2aJAKT3C-M/s1600/elements+fire+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="185" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--x7SzByFqJ8/UAN50iElStI/AAAAAAAABrI/l2aJAKT3C-M/s320/elements+fire+temple.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketch of the fire temple's "tea room"</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B4vx2Xcbrws/UAN53Woe0FI/AAAAAAAABrQ/OHHMFzZI2Mg/s1600/elements+water+throne.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="184" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B4vx2Xcbrws/UAN53Woe0FI/AAAAAAAABrQ/OHHMFzZI2Mg/s320/elements+water+throne.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketch of the water temple's "throne room"</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c5z8VivuyT0/UAN5_IwrX6I/AAAAAAAABrY/I4cvgSpziUk/s1600/elements+fire+overhead.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c5z8VivuyT0/UAN5_IwrX6I/AAAAAAAABrY/I4cvgSpziUk/s640/elements+fire+overhead.jpg" width="434" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketch of the fire temple</td></tr></tbody></table><br />One unfortunate thing is that I don't have much in-game art to show. Since the art made from these sketches is "really" the work of my team's artists, I'm not comfortable sharing it. What mini-games were implemented aren't something that can be easily shared either, as are the environments and dialogue that I scripted out using our in-game scene editor...so, bummer.<br /><br />Why was the project canceled? Mainly because our small team (one designer, one programmer, and roughly four artists) couldn't compete with much larger teams working on the market. Art style is at the forefront of the hidden object genre, with many players turning away if something is too dark or too colorful, and we didn't have the power to create, polish, and re-polish within a reasonable timeframe, especially with the paint-y style that we wanted to move forward with. &nbsp;There was also greater interest with pursuing more "game-y" games, hidden objects being fairly linear.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mPTPHA4aTQo/UAOokIYbyJI/AAAAAAAABr8/bTRj-F6cECw/s1600/elements+air+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="408" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mPTPHA4aTQo/UAOokIYbyJI/AAAAAAAABr8/bTRj-F6cECw/s640/elements+air+temple.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketches of the air temple, which (spoilers) was going to be on the back of a bird<br />that blue is a plastic tape-bookmarker-thing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Perhaps some elements of...Elements...will be recycled for future projects.</div>

My favorite thing to do is start projects, particularly those that involve huge copious amounts of writing, so it stands to reason that I've been wanting for like forever to make a blog in which I could attempt making pro conversation/discussion with myself about things that I want to learn/practice/improve upon in general.<br /><br />My project threads are as follows:<br /><ul><li><strong>Red Moleskine:</strong> For whatever form inspiration strikes in, including abruptly making some observation about the weather, drawing up a database schema for a web app (that I found out has already been done), sketching out shiba inu people, etc. etc.</li><li><strong>Spotty Daiso Notebook:</strong> For taking note of the myriad of programming/software-design related things that I have no idea about, so that I actually look them up later; also, to keep track of tasks for school research projects</li><li><strong><a href="opalitewires.blogspot.com">Opalite Wires</a>:</strong> For practicing writing something completely uncalled for every single day</li><li><strong>Normal Blog:</strong> Also for practicing writing something completely uncalled for every single day, but also for purposes of coming back months later to ooze nostalgically over whatever I wrote the previous year and see whether I'm still friends with the people that I talked about</li></ul>This makes for tons of ideas that are all over the place, and ANYWAY, the point is that, the objective of <em>this</em> blog is: to try and consolidate, into a relatively intelligible way, all the things that I do in all the other threads.<br /><br />IT WILL MAKE SENSE WHEN THERE'S MORE THINGS.</div>
