<blockquote><p>It is not a peaceful time in the Dells. The young King Nash clings to his throne while rebel lords in the north and south build armies to unseat him. The mountains and forests are filled with spies and thieves and lawless men.</p>

<p>This is where Fire lives. With a wild, irresistible appearance and hair the color of flame, Fire is the last remaining human monster. Equally hated and adored, she had the unique ability to control minds, but she guards her power, unwilling to steal the secrets of innocent people. Especially when she has so many of her own.</p>

<p>Then Prince Brigan comes to bring her to King City, The royal family needs her help to uncover the plot against the king. Far away from home, Fire begins to realize there's more to her power than she ever dreamed. Her power could save the kingdom.</p>

<p>If only she weren't afraid of becoming the monster her father was.</p></blockquote>


<p>[spoilers below]</p>

<p><em>Fire</em> was alright. I liked the strangeness of monsters and their many colors; I liked all the politics, the twist that Fire had killed her own father and the general confusion of royal bloodlines. As in <em><a href="/blog/2013-12-16-graceling/"/>Graceling</a></em>, the non-drama of sexual relationships is a relief. While reading, I hated Archer for being a posessive male character that we are meant to sympathize with; but thinking back, I don&rsquo;t think that his possessive behavior was ever excused by the story&hellip;except, I guess, for Fire&rsquo;s musing about how her innate monster beauty may have compelled Archer to become as horribly possessive as he was. This is uncomfortable because of its similarity to modern &ldquo;victim-blaming&rdquo; narratives, even if <em>Fire</em> explores Fire&rsquo;s strange ability to compel all humans when they look at her, not just men. It&rsquo;s also nice to see a romance not totally typical of YA: a non-virgin woman who falls in love with a man who already has a child.</p>

<p>One downside is that the voice of Fire herself doesn&rsquo;t differ too much from Katsa&rsquo;s in <em>Graceling</em>. Fire feels like a parallel universe Katsa, whose story ultimately isn&rsquo;t as interesting. One of the main reasons I was so attracted to the <em>Graceling</em> was — well — the Graces — and since the Dell doesn&rsquo;t have them, and since Katsa&rsquo;s world doesn&rsquo;t have monsters, this book feels like it&rsquo;s set in an entirely different universe. There&rsquo;s none of the excitement of familiarity, the fun of adding to the breadth and meaning of <em>Graceling</em>&rsquo;s world. The one connection between <em>Graceling</em> and <em>Fire</em> is Leck, but we barely know him from the first book, and I&rsquo;m not interested in any mysteries about how he came to be, since by the end of <em>Graceling</em> he&rsquo;s already dead. Leck&rsquo;s descent into sadism in <em>Fire</em> isn&rsquo;t particularly complex, either; he is shown to be a sociopath from the very beginning, and all interactions that he has with Fire feel tacked on and separate from Fire&rsquo;s own character growth. Had there been more of a commonality with <em>Graceling</em>, <em>Fire</em> would have been more of a hit with me.</p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3236307-graceling">via</a>)</p>




<blockquote><p>Katsa has been able to kill a man with her bare hands since she was eight - she's a Graceling, one of the rare people in her land born with an extreme skill. As niece of the king, she should be able to live a life of privilege, but Graced as she is with killing, she is forced to work as the king's thug.</p>

<p>When she first meets Prince Po, Graced with combat skills, Katsa has no hint of how her life is about to change.</p>

<p>She never expects to become Po's friend.</p>

<p>She never expects to learn a new truth about her own Grace - or about a terrible secret that lies hidden far away...</p></blockquote>


<p>[spoilers below]</p>

<p>I finished <em>Graceling</em> and its companions in less than a week. I liked them — I liked the fairytale-ish turn of phrases (&ldquo;she had one eye blue and one eye green&rdquo;), the strangeness and OPness of Graces, the nondrama of sexual relationships. In <em>Graceling</em>, I can see how Katsa comes to like Po, and how her attraction to him is unique to her and her situation — being unable to trust that she wouldn&rsquo;t hurt anyone, he gives her a situation in which she can finally be herself.</p>

<p>The pacing was a little strange. One chapter near the beginning is devoted to exposition about the world, and is incredibly difficult to read through: there are so many new names to remember, so much information that gets in the way of the action I wanted to return to. The ending of the story drops suddenly as well: after Katsa primes the pirates to be ready for Leck&rsquo;s possible attack, it turns out Leck has already arrived at her supposed safehaven. Some of the motivations were tough for me to understand as well. How did Katsa and Po know so abruptly that Bitterblue was to be protected, at the cost of their own life? If Katsa was so adamant about not having children, why did she feel so strongly protective of Bitterblue? (I understand that you can not want to have children, and still like them; but there wasn&rsquo;t much other evidence for why Katsa would take to Bitterblue so strongly, especially given the distance with which she seemed to hold other acquaintances.) Why was Po ashamed of being blind? In fact, what was the purpose of those chapters at the end where the main Leck-related conflict has already been resolved, and all that&rsquo;s left is to angst about Po&rsquo;s blindness?</p>

<p>Overall <em>Graceling</em> was an entertaining read, and all the more fun because Katsa&rsquo;s &ldquo;true&rdquo; Grace was hinted at pretty well and it was fun to figure out for yourself what her talent actually was. I&rsquo;m also a fan of how she worked out what sort of relationship that she wanted with Po in the end, though, like with Brave, I felt a little dissonance with what she perceived marriage to be. It&rsquo;s strange to read fantasy and sit tight for explanations of multiple kingdoms and magic powers — and yet never be told why there are such conservative constructions of marriage, and why they have remained unchallenged. The limitations that we have in Real Life — patriarchy, religious morals — aren&rsquo;t elaborated on in <em>Graceling</em> and some other fantasy novels. It&rsquo;s strange to read books where misogyny exists because that&rsquo;s &ldquo;just the the way it is,&rdquo; even if characters challenge it later.</p>

One hundred and eighty voices - male and female, young and old, from all walks of life and all over the country - talk intimately to the reader. Combining great humor and pathos this remarkable selection of stories from the thousands submitted to NPR's Weekend <i>All Things Considered</i> National Story Project gives the reader a glimpse of America's soul in all its diversity.</blockquote><br /><div class="p1"><i>I Thought My Father was God </i>is a compilation of short stories submitted by listeners to NPR's National Story Project, and is fantastic. The events of each story are poignant in their mundanity; the fact that some of these stories were carried throughout the years and then threaded into words gives them a special impact, even if the events themselves are ordinary.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I was the third to be passed this book, after S and A, who read it over the course of several weeks. They found the stories too emotionally heavy to read more than a handful at a time; I found them too delicious to restrain myself. Each story is a good example of how small moments in someone's life can resonate through years, through actions, through all parts of you; each one reminds me of the impact my own actions can make, however small, and reminds me the the lives of people around me are larger than the glances we exchange as we pass by on the sidewalk.</div><br /><div class="p1">My favorite story is <i>Iceman of Market Street</i>, especially given recent discussions about <a href="http://grist.org/cities/the-dark-side-of-startup-city/">the dark side of San Francisco's transformations</a>.</div></div>

He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he has dreams. His ability to connect with the outside world is limited to a few grunted syllables, but his inner life is deep, full of wonder and longing.<br /><br />After experiencing a teenage boy's memories while consuming his brain, R makes an unexpected choice that begins a tense, awkward, and strangely sweet relationship with the victim's human girlfriend. Julie is a blast of color in the otherwise dreary and gray landscape that surrounds R. His choice to protect her will transform not only R, but his fellow Dead, and perhaps their whole lifeless world.<br /><br />Scary, funny, and surprisingly poignant, Warm Bodies explores what happens when the cold heart of a zombie is tempted by the warmth of human love.</i></blockquote><br />I read <em>Warm Bodies</em>&nbsp;a couple weekends ago and it was positively delightful. Every other page I was waving my arms in A's direction and begging him to listen to me read aloud. "Zombie romance" does seem to be the next logical step after "vampire romance" and "werewolf romance," but I never thought it would be this fun.<br /><br />[spoilers ahead] <br /><br />The only thing that fell flat for me was the character of Julie, who wavered a little too far on the side of the Dreaded Manic Pixie Dream Girl for me, and her quirks — keeping a wall in her room for "the future," adopting a nickname of "Julie Cabernet" instead of "Julie Grigio" — were not just "meh," but also didn't contribute noticeably to the plot. The fact that she came to be considered as So Important to the healing of zombies by the book's end also wavered uncomfortably on Mary Sue-ness.<br /><br />Other than that, <em>Warm Bodies</em> was tons of fun. Marion's detail on the "culture" of zombies — the way years pass in a haze, the way some zombies become skeletal "Boneys," the way hunger resonates through their cells and how they are sated only with living brains and flashes of memory — were fantastic. So too were the little details of his world's apocalypse: the way some people miss the sound of airplanes, for example, or the way that stadiums have been disemboweled and remade into gigantic slums. Marion's writing is also super poignant in illustrating the typical un-life of a zombie.<br /><br /><blockquote><em>There is a chasm between me and the world outside of me. A gap so wide my feelings can't cross it. By the time my screams reach the other side, they have dwindled into groans.</em></blockquote><br />I was surprised to learn there are even more <em>Warm Bodies</em> books, and though I felt this first volume ended on a pretty satisfying note, I'm sure I'll get to the others eventually.</div>

Suffice to say that processed foods are achieved through an incredible amount of user testing and design, the results of which understands so deeply the heart and chemical of human desire that game designs would probably blush if they could.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">For example, did you know that Doritos can be made without the powder coating your fingers, and taste exactly the same — but that the manufacturers keep Doritos with the powder because they view it as part of the "experience" of eating Doritos? I am skeptical, but impressed by the idea.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Both books touch on how processed food conquered kitchens under the weakened defenses of working, busy parents. <i>Salt Sugar Fat </i>was an in-depth view on these ingredients and their uses through the industry; <i>Pandora's Lunchbox </i>touched on these as well, but also explored trends like the use of soybeans in Everything, and research on the benefits of whole foods versus processed foods.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">For example, did you know that a Japanese study fed two groups of rats food that was nutritionally identical, but one group got "normal" hard pellets and one received "puffed" pellets (like puffed cereal)? The rats that received "puffed" pellets ended up gaining a significant amount of weight over the other rats! Potentially because food calories are partially used in actually breaking down that food, and foods that are processed take up less calories to break down, in addition to allowing sugars and starches to enter the bloodstream more quickly than the body may be able to handle.</div><br /><div class="p1">Rather than being wholly disgusted by processed foods, I find myself weirdly more interested and fascinated by them and the fact that their taste and texture has been so incredibly optimized for my body.<br /><br />I'm also way more enthusiastic for farmer's markets than I was before. To prove it, here's a photo of my new arpakasso with some potatoes I obtained last Saturday!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/8918019794/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sXthaSc3jMg/Ua1iAUW4gPI/AAAAAAAADrk/hmqw405b354/s640/tumblr_mnqmyiw6Dz1qdycalo4_500.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i named him "babbu"</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I recommend both books to people who have an interest in food as well as an interest in what can make humans enjoy things perhaps more than they should.</div></div>
