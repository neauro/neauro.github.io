I loved <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/10/bastion-logtistical-est.html">Bastion</a> and I'm super super super excited for <i>Transistor</i>, because it has a female protagonist with curly hair. <i>Curly hair!</i><br /><br />(Or at the very least, <i>wavy hair!</i>)<br /><br />I was not keen on attending PAX this year until I found a friend selling tickets and my compulsion to hoard scarce resources broke through my skepticism of the event. I first went in 2009 and stopped out of boredom and <a href="http://debacle.tumblr.com/">discomfort</a>, but decided I'd give this year another try, not because I think trivializing rape is okay (I <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/genesis-2.html">don't</a>) but because I wanted to see if the environment has changed since <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2013/06/full-ign-interview-with-anita-sarkeesian/">Tropes Vs Women</a>. I also really, really, <i>really</i> wanted to see <i>Transistor</i>.<br /><br />Since I got my tickets late, I started cosplay work only about a month before PAX started, which also happened to be right in the swing of summer quarter. Making the sword was fun and challenging, mostly because it was my first time working with plastic. First I made some sketches and then a model using some leftover foam from my <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2013/04/sakura-con-2013-cosplay-black-rock.html">Strength cosplay</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uP3HTT7dTS4/Uif_sQSC7DI/AAAAAAAAD-s/487Li4QQ4lc/s1600/sketch.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="482" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uP3HTT7dTS4/Uif_sQSC7DI/AAAAAAAAD-s/487Li4QQ4lc/s640/sketch.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">such cosplay wow</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then I visited <a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/">TAP Plastics</a> and after beating around the bush I admitted that I was making a giant sword. Turns out the guy staffing was also a cosplayer and happy to give me advice, which I desperately needed. I had my heart set on a blue-y transparent plastic, which they didn't have, but he explained that if I painted on the backside of clear plastic, <em>it would look like a mirror</em>â€¦and that sounded great! I got a couple samples of green-edge acrylic and tried out a couple different paint colors on it.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lo5wfmiMpD4/Uif_5u8R3wI/AAAAAAAAD-0/S4caFilJwac/s1600/paint+test.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="290" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lo5wfmiMpD4/Uif_5u8R3wI/AAAAAAAAD-0/S4caFilJwac/s640/paint+test.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i was so bright-eyed then</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A pointed out that what would really make the sword striking would be a strong contrast between the base color and "solder lines," so for the base color I decided on using a lot of green to really make the inner lines stand out.<br /><br />Then I visited TAP Plastics to get the pieces cut, and at the last moment decided I wanted not just half an inch thickness of plastic, but a whole inch. Imagine my shock and horror when I realized that such a width of plastic is actually heavy. Like, <em>really</em> heavy. (I don't have a scale, but a friend's estimate when he picked up the final product and grimaced was 35 lbs, so I'm going with that number.)<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8SxFDzB53F0/UigAxKgvILI/AAAAAAAAD-8/e-Q0WPJRfeA/s1600/heavy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="531" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8SxFDzB53F0/UigAxKgvILI/AAAAAAAAD-8/e-Q0WPJRfeA/s640/heavy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">heavy, but still not as unwieldy as strength arms</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My plan was to do a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_glass_painting">reverse painting</a> deal on both sides of the sword and then sandwich them together. I used masking tape to copy out my drawn pattern on both sides, and first painted in the solder lines with a mixture of paints: pearly blue, shiny white, and glow-in-the-dark!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eD85Y44KYCU/UigDLfD2H_I/AAAAAAAAD_Q/sqjs_uu_nhI/s1600/painting.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eD85Y44KYCU/UigDLfD2H_I/AAAAAAAAD_Q/sqjs_uu_nhI/s640/painting.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">left photo courtesy of <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I didn't get to see the glow paint in action, unfortunately, and the fact that it's sort of thick and grainy made me nervous that the plastic pieces would stick together properly when pressed together.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HOuHj5pMteQ/UigFL3SxDwI/AAAAAAAAD_c/pxT8F5MNiZI/s1600/peel+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="478" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HOuHj5pMteQ/UigFL3SxDwI/AAAAAAAAD_c/pxT8F5MNiZI/s640/peel+montage.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">peeling the tape off was <i>so satisfying</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I had two circular pieces of plastic that I wanted to attach to the outside of the sword for the Transistor's red "eye," but there's also a sort of depression/border around the eye. I realized that in my limited time I wouldn't be able to do anything three-dimensional for that border, so I decided to just paint another blue circle.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kei6SIadyXw/UigHA-lNSkI/AAAAAAAAD_o/yicAVzmckIU/s1600/circle.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="489" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kei6SIadyXw/UigHA-lNSkI/AAAAAAAAD_o/yicAVzmckIU/s640/circle.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dry dry dry! (also there's A, because i need another picture to even this out)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Meanwhile, the eye got the same "reverse painting" treatment.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yemSRp3_suM/UigH1_cWiEI/AAAAAAAAD_w/GZqDWc-Bgcg/s1600/eye+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yemSRp3_suM/UigH1_cWiEI/AAAAAAAAD_w/GZqDWc-Bgcg/s640/eye+montage.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i see you</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Once the solder lines were done, I combined green-y metallic paint and blue metallic paint and painted that down across both pieces.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WPj04DrWiJ0/UigIDnuiGtI/AAAAAAAAEAA/CsjwKL-x1eA/s1600/base+color.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WPj04DrWiJ0/UigIDnuiGtI/AAAAAAAAEAA/CsjwKL-x1eA/s640/base+color.jpg" width="425" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">such contrast</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Since I was swamped with making the actual costume, A helped out with the handle and cutting out what we referred to as the "top fins" and "side fins" from plywood. Because the plastic turned out to be so heavy, and because we were pressed for time, we left the handle rectangular, rather than shaved down to the canon cylinder.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AOFidkP7444/UigIgs5iDyI/AAAAAAAAEAI/U6O5SE2-dQ0/s1600/DSC_0275.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AOFidkP7444/UigIgs5iDyI/AAAAAAAAEAI/U6O5SE2-dQ0/s640/DSC_0275.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">plywood fins</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After that, with his father's help, A and I clamped the two pieces together in a vise and drilled holes through the wood and plastic! Again not canon, but the pieces were <em>such heavy wow, </em>and needed that extra reinforcement.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ36fytFm70/UigJlaSW8uI/AAAAAAAAEAU/4XrID4GWUV4/s1600/drill+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ36fytFm70/UigJlaSW8uI/AAAAAAAAEAU/4XrID4GWUV4/s640/drill+montage.jpg" width="508" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so close!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After drilling, we had planned to take the sword apart and touch up the paint a bit, butâ€¦after all the clamping, the two pieces of plastic ended up <em>completely stuck together</em>. So much for worrying about it coming apart.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lFnXTGExgtY/UigJylAc8dI/AAAAAAAAEAc/CemsLFy3qgo/s1600/plywood.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lFnXTGExgtY/UigJylAc8dI/AAAAAAAAEAc/CemsLFy3qgo/s640/plywood.jpg" width="424" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the light does cool shading tricks through the plastic</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The last thing to be built was the pommel, which A flashed out overnight. I have no pictures of it, but it was made out of some plastic canisters and a plastic soysauce dish hot-glued together and painted over. Cosplay at its finest. :')<br /><br />Finally, what was left was to paint the plywood pieces, and then glue on the red eye. A also put on some electrical tape to make the side fins appear more indented, but the tape near-immediately fell off during peace-bonding. Ah well!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2tCzKsrHSt8/UigKzHyNehI/AAAAAAAAEAk/mjFAjlJXg7g/s1600/finalish+montage+copy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="456" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2tCzKsrHSt8/UigKzHyNehI/AAAAAAAAEAk/mjFAjlJXg7g/s640/finalish+montage+copy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">done!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />As for the dress itselfâ€¦I reused the racer-back tank pattern I made for the Strength cosplay, though I made it longer and added a kind of cape for the sleeves. I wanted to sew the jacket as well but ran out of time and ended up compromising by sewing a satin triangle to a long black jacket I found at a consignment store a couple days before PAX. The last thing I did was the feather collar, which I made by sewing feathers into leftover Strength felt and sewing it around the dress's neck.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v5pXoNDFlwg/UigLYHBNKzI/AAAAAAAAEAs/YCIBxAQnyKw/s1600/DSC_0293.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v5pXoNDFlwg/UigLYHBNKzI/AAAAAAAAEAs/YCIBxAQnyKw/s640/DSC_0293.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">feathers!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />On the day before PAX I also quicked out the triangular ring from Sculpey (also left over from Strength cosplay; thank goodness I can reuse so much stuff) and acrylic paint.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TsVv3uZLfkA/UigL1ImNGlI/AAAAAAAAEA0/6du08qR3d88/s1600/IMG_6350+copy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TsVv3uZLfkA/UigL1ImNGlI/AAAAAAAAEA0/6du08qR3d88/s640/IMG_6350+copy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">photo by <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Sooo overallâ€¦though there are a couple things I want to re-do for the next round (including remaking the feather collar and ring), I finished a new cosplay and am proud of my new forays into the world of plastic! PAX itself was fun in and of itself; I was really happy to finally play Transistor, and even more excited for it once I actually played and recognized all the programming nods. I was a little bewildered by the inclusion of the "stop time and attack" thing, until I realized it was <em>so thematic</em> â€” since the Transistor's atacks are sort of like methods, "stopping time" to queue up attacks and execute them really mirrors compiling programs. <i>Uwaaa.</i><br /><br />I was also surprised and happy to see so many cool Reds at PAX, many of whom had taken the extra leap to use ~*electricity*~! I briefly ran into the Red from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Breakers-Cosplay/419407924815813">Breakers Cosplay</a> who was super impressive and inspiring. I also met a lot of progressive dudes and women who specifically talked about how awesome it is to have A Female Protagonist in a game (something I don't think I would have <em>never</em> heard anyone say flat-out in years past), and a lot of friendly people in general who gamely attempted holding my Transistor and remarked at how they admired my ridiculousness for carrying it around all day at the convention, haha. To be fair, my arms were really sore afterward, but all my rock climbing callouses helped out quite a bit!<br /><br />My favorite moment in all of PAX was to meet Jen Zee, who was so awesome and kind and asked for pictures in which I tried desperately to look cool despite my euphoria. She also gave me a ton of Supergiant swag that I placed all around my house immediately. :')<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uIlReuprg1U/UigMVP6jKFI/AAAAAAAAEA8/kw8k9oCPExI/s1600/DSC_0306.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uIlReuprg1U/UigMVP6jKFI/AAAAAAAAEA8/kw8k9oCPExI/s1600/DSC_0306.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i christen thee, supergiant wall</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There was also a magical instant where A and I, passing curiously by the Paramount, suddenly realized that Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett were performing and dashed inside as quickly as possible and caught <i>the Transistor song</i>!<br /><br />All this being said, I had a great weekend, mostly due to the friends and people I was able to meet. I don't think I feel comfortable enough to return again (because <a href="http://shoshanakessock.com/2013/09/04/pax-youve-gone-and-done-it-an-open-letter/">reasons</a>), but I am thankful for my personal experience this year.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CWR-fH-wYac/UigQ5IFyy7I/AAAAAAAAEBI/GzPz6mXRg3s/s1600/1240322_10151588009897060_1663051843_n_1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="534" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CWR-fH-wYac/UigQ5IFyy7I/AAAAAAAAEBI/GzPz6mXRg3s/s640/1240322_10151588009897060_1663051843_n_1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">especially for time runnin around with <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a>!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And finally, now that both my summer quarter classes and PAX are completely finished, I am free!<br /><br />â€¦and ready to devote myself to a new project! Maybe something for the <a href="http://towerjam.tumblr.com/post/59682821300/welcome-to-tower-jam">Tower Jam</a>?</div>

Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by giants. Giants are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source.

Garden stuff has been progressing without me writing much about it because recently I am lucky if I can manage to wake up early enough or stay up long enough at home to water anything, much less take photos of it and muse upon its growth. Suffice to say that at the start of spring I went crazy over some on-sale seeds and attempted to plant some in seed starter pots.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HbVoI1I65dc/UZkzqoJegjI/AAAAAAAADmA/xv4ionrdSvE/s1600/pots.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HbVoI1I65dc/UZkzqoJegjI/AAAAAAAADmA/xv4ionrdSvE/s640/pots.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">march pots</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Dragon's Tongue Wax Beans in particular looked super cool and exciting and got off to a great start indoorsâ€¦<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bxXJjsUTwl8/UZk0YNfGEzI/AAAAAAAADmI/c6o1a7VLsEg/s1600/b20cad109e0611e2977522000a9f308b_6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bxXJjsUTwl8/UZk0YNfGEzI/AAAAAAAADmI/c6o1a7VLsEg/s1600/b20cad109e0611e2977522000a9f308b_6.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">lil things</td></tr></tbody></table><br />â€¦but when I transplanted them outside, they didn't last two weeks. Maybe I didn't harden them off enough? Maybe, like swiss chard, they're too delicate to withstand transplanting? When I transplanted them I also planted some new beans, and these happen to be doing really well. Unlike the indoor starts, they have very deep green leaves and thick stems.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BWMd4Y28qBI/UZk0e1u9oNI/AAAAAAAADmQ/0fb0RZ25HP0/s1600/beans.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BWMd4Y28qBI/UZk0e1u9oNI/AAAAAAAADmQ/0fb0RZ25HP0/s640/beans.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">transplants in the back, new beans in the front</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My other surprise is the success of my radishes, which I planted outdoors in March alongside some arugula and swiss chard. Look, they're doing it!

My mistake was not staggering out their sowing, however, so I pretty much just have this batch and that's it for now.<br /><br />Speaking of the spinach, as soon as the heat started getting up to around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, they started sending up flowers. The plants rise up over my knee now, and their stalks are as thick as my fingers, and it's hard to believe that they used to be just little seeds.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nrNtX57556s/UZk01kBXMTI/AAAAAAAADmg/isuH3F_SXMk/s1600/spinach.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nrNtX57556s/UZk01kBXMTI/AAAAAAAADmg/isuH3F_SXMk/s640/spinach.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">biiig spinaches</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My lime tree has really perked up now that the weather has gotten better, though has still suffered from leaves that are pale green and strangely droopy and bendy. They feel almost elastic. Some internet research has uncovered that I, in my passion to not drown it, I may be <em>under watering</em> it. Since being given a couple thorough soaks, the leaves indeed seem a little stiffer and greener. I've also repotted it into something larger and more sturdy than its initial black pot. No flowers or fruit yet, probably because it's been stressed and dehydrated for the better part of its life with me.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2K9oGih_FtA/UZk5k9YELFI/AAAAAAAADm8/kUQGMmKcBW4/s1600/lime.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2K9oGih_FtA/UZk5k9YELFI/AAAAAAAADm8/kUQGMmKcBW4/s640/lime.jpg" width="424" /></a></div><br /><br />Speaking of stressed and dehydrated, before the winter started Andou and I received a very impressive-looking 30 year old jade tree...<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FBtg2WrZ7_0/UZk4kr_GXTI/AAAAAAAADmw/pxyd6OAy_aQ/s1600/JADE.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FBtg2WrZ7_0/UZk4kr_GXTI/AAAAAAAADmw/pxyd6OAy_aQ/s640/JADE.jpg" width="424" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">jade tree on the sunniest part of our house, the laundry room</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was very concerned about killing it, especially since, despite my diligent watering, its leaves began to fall off in gooey yellow curls. Some internet research has uncovered that I, in my passion to not kill it, I was probably <em>over watering</em> it. I've since then toned down and the tree seems okay on its new perch over the dryer. One branch even bloomed little white blossoms! Whoa!<br /><br />My air plants from last year are doing well. In the picture below, the top plant had one pup that is now fairly large, and the bottom actually had two pups, so it's getting to be a handful.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ePFiQPKUfGE/UZk6H_Nc0ZI/AAAAAAAADnM/iV_Tzcv5RKk/s1600/DSC_0008.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ePFiQPKUfGE/UZk6H_Nc0ZI/AAAAAAAADnM/iV_Tzcv5RKk/s640/DSC_0008.jpg" width="480" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">spot the pups!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It's been about a year since <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/tillandsia-pups.html">I got them at the UW Street Fair</a>, and when the fair rolled around again this weekend I was excited to pick up more! Four more, in fact. I was excited to get ones with weirder tentacle shapes, and then also picked up two teensy blooming ones, one of which already looks like it's growing a pup. The two little ones are already a year old and were blooming already, so it makes me a little bewildered about why my plants from last year are not blooming. Maybe I should invest in some fertilizer.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K9mnSDnlg8c/UZk62g87ozI/AAAAAAAADnY/gdU6fXWDE2k/s1600/new+tillandsia.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K9mnSDnlg8c/UZk62g87ozI/AAAAAAAADnY/gdU6fXWDE2k/s640/new+tillandsia.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">spot the pup!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Speaking of plants retrieved at fairs, my sedums are doing okay. The iceplant-looking one is faring the best of all of them. I've moved three of them to a little pot I bought at Daiso and tried to give them succulent soil to see if they would do any better than in normal potting soil, but thus far I don't observe any difference.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gxWzNb7CxSk/UZk8esDbULI/AAAAAAAADno/0tJ7GN8_R44/s1600/sedum.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gxWzNb7CxSk/UZk8esDbULI/AAAAAAAADno/0tJ7GN8_R44/s640/sedum.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sedums in a long pot</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Speaking of succulent soil, the reason why I had some is because I got another succulent! I saw it on sale at the hardware store and couldn't resist. Donkey/burro tail plants are so neat-looking. Some of the little bean-leaves had detached and fallen between into the dirt inside the pot, so I took them out and placed them in their own pots to see if they might grow into new plants.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NY0YtOmu5JE/UZk8k9hneQI/AAAAAAAADnw/mxgqWYJAGFE/s1600/succulent+tail.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NY0YtOmu5JE/UZk8k9hneQI/AAAAAAAADnw/mxgqWYJAGFE/s640/succulent+tail.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">burro tail on the dryer</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And that's (almost) all of what I have growing.</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
Ever since my old roommate Molly made butternut squash a couple years ago, I've really wanted to try making it myself. My first experience with it was like <i>whoa</i>. Who knew such decadence could some from such an unassuming squash?<br /><br />I found <a href="http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/detail.asp?docid=31244">a recipe from the online version of Cook's Illustrated</a>&nbsp;to try out, since other recipes I found toss in tons of cream and recommend roasting the squash to dehydrate it and bring out its flavor, and I didn't want to go through the extra effort and ingredients.&nbsp;What no one mentions, however, is that the most time-consuming part of cooking butternut squash soup is actually processing the squash in the first place. I tried three different knives to peel and cube this thing, each less sufficient than the last.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q435kdunnFQ/UI2gz-YbrdI/AAAAAAAACu8/EBkYIteOgnQ/s1600/butternut1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="380" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q435kdunnFQ/UI2gz-YbrdI/AAAAAAAACu8/EBkYIteOgnQ/s640/butternut1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">@_____@</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The next obstacle was my lack of a Dutch oven, which is what the recipe suggests you cook everything in. An internet search seemed to suggest that any old pot with some foil put over the top of it would suffice, so I tried that, but then came across Problem #2: my pot was way too small to fit all the squash and leeks, much less another four cups of vegetable broth. So, I decided to cook two halves of the soon-to-be-soup separately, except probably this pot was really not the best pot to use in the first place, because it became severely burnt.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fhks8KwDpiw/UI2g1EliJVI/AAAAAAAACvM/XUevdLW3rIU/s1600/butternut3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fhks8KwDpiw/UI2g1EliJVI/AAAAAAAACvM/XUevdLW3rIU/s640/butternut3.jpg" width="562" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i really doubt this is the "fond" that's supposed to form at the pot's bottom</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I moved to a shallower pan and that seemed to work.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eqJHjzzHAvA/UI2g1prxHEI/AAAAAAAACvU/Tr74gpu-aKU/s1600/butternut4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eqJHjzzHAvA/UI2g1prxHEI/AAAAAAAACvU/Tr74gpu-aKU/s640/butternut4.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">...maybe?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />By the time all of the squash had been boiled down, it still wasn't quite...soupy.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5MAPtVEXTYQ/UI2g2U-TAHI/AAAAAAAACvc/b5e8R9SW08Q/s1600/butternut5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5MAPtVEXTYQ/UI2g2U-TAHI/AAAAAAAACvc/b5e8R9SW08Q/s640/butternut5.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">:C</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I thought I would be okay without a blender, but the soup at this stage was very fibrous and chunky and unappealing. Enter Problem #3: I have no food processor!<br /><br />Luckily the neighbors do, so we ran over there just to make use of their Vitamix.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QVtCSxR0fMc/UI2g2-VznJI/AAAAAAAACvk/l749c7wmNw4/s1600/butternut6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QVtCSxR0fMc/UI2g2-VznJI/AAAAAAAACvk/l749c7wmNw4/s640/butternut6.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">YES. IT LOOKS LIKE SOUP. YESSS</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Final touch: a swirl of sour cream, which sounded questionable but actually complemented the flavors very well.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jpH3ScABd-4/UI2g3UUSZ1I/AAAAAAAACvs/WihZfU0D9SY/s1600/butternut7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jpH3ScABd-4/UI2g3UUSZ1I/AAAAAAAACvs/WihZfU0D9SY/s640/butternut7.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">woo!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It was delicious! Hopefully I'll have the chance to make this recipe again before the season's out.</div>
