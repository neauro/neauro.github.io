<blockquote>June and Day have sacrificed so much for the people of the Republic—and each other—and now their country is on the brink of a new existence. June is back in the good graces of the Republic, working within the government’s elite circles as Princeps-Elect, while Day has been assigned a high-level military position. <br/><br/> 
But neither could have predicted the circumstances that will reunite them: just when a peace treaty is imminent, a plague outbreak causes panic in the Colonies, and war threatens the Republic’s border cities. This new strain of plague is deadlier than ever, and June is the only one who knows the key to her country’s defense. But saving the lives of thousands will mean asking the one she loves to give up everything. <br/><br/>
With heart-pounding action and suspense, Marie Lu’s bestselling trilogy draws to a stunning conclusion. (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14290364-champion">Goodreads</a>)</blockquote>


<p>(I&rsquo;ve also written about the previous books in the <em>Legend</em> trilogy, <a href="/blog/2012/10/06/legend-marie-lu/"><em>Legend</em></a> and <a href="/blog/2013/05/21/prodigy-marie-lu/"><em>Prodigy</em></a>.)</p>

<p>I finally finished Champion on the bus to work and felt all shaky and full of feels. After having been disappointed by the endings of other YA trilogies I&rsquo;ve finished recently, I was nervous about this one; and though there were some strange parts, ultimately this whole story delivered exactly what I wanted, which was: the bittersweet, bright-future fulfillment of a &ldquo;we are enemies from two different worlds&rdquo; power couple romance.</p>

<p>[ spoilers ahead ]</p>

<p>There were a few strange parts. Thomas' spoken blow-by-blow, feeling-by-feeling recollection of the night he killed Metias felt kind of awkawrd to me; and there was also more &ldquo;hand-holding&rdquo; than I would have liked. As the story goes on Day begins to lose his memory, and when trying to recollect the name of his caretaker, thinks to himself &ldquo;<em>That&rsquo;s weird</em>&rdquo;&hellip;but as readers, we <em>know</em> that it&rsquo;s strange for Day to forget the name of his long-known caretaker. That the book takes time to point it out takes away part of the fun of realizing it for ourselves.</p>

<p>The society of Antarctica, based entirely on a game-like system of points and ranking, is also thrown in as a curiosity of world-building and not examined in relation to existing structures at all. Given that the Republic of America (with its &ldquo;democratic dictatorship&rdquo; feel) and the Colonies of the America (with its &ldquo;capitalistic tyranny&rdquo; feel) are both recognized as having flaws, I thought that Antarctica might also have criticisms; but Antarctica remains unquestioned and accepted as a powerful government whose allyship is desired. There&rsquo;s nothing terribly &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; with this treatment, but I&rsquo;d really like something more — for this strange piece of world-building to fit into an overall theme, for it to contrast with what June and Day see as admirable about their own country. Maybe something like, &ldquo;Sure, in Antarctica people do good so they can get points, but where <em>we</em> live people do good just because they can and want to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyway, it was an enjoyable trilogy and I&rsquo;m looking forward to more from Marie Lu in the future!</p>

With the Republic edging closer to chaos, the two join a group of Patriot rebels eager to help Day rescue his brother and offer passage to the Colonies. They have only one request—June and Day must assassinate the new Elector.<br /><br />It’s their chance to change the nation, to give voice to a people silenced for too long. <br /><br />But as June realizes this Elector is nothing like his father, she’s haunted by the choice ahead. What if Anden is a new beginning? What if revolution must be more than loss and vengeance, anger and blood—what if the Patriots are wrong?<br /><br />In this highly-anticipated sequel, Lu delivers a breathtaking thriller with high stakes and cinematic action.</em></blockquote><br />[spoilers ahead] <br /><br />I finished <em>Prodigy</em> this past weekend, and enjoyed it. June and Day had more distinctive voices, and some of my confusions I had with the <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/10/legend-marie-lu.html">previous book</a> were addressed more clearly here. In particular, the history of the Republic and the Colonies and how they came to be in conflict with each other is finally revealed, and probably for the best in this book, rather than in <em>Legend</em>; I can't imagine the needless bulk that would have been in the first book had all that exposition been thrown in there.<br /><br /><em>Prodigy</em>'s subversions of cliche were fun; just when you think June has no idea she's being tricked, she reveals that she knows even more than you do about what's going on, with a cleverness that isn't eye-rolling. I thought that June and Day's role in the rebellion as Beloved of the People was a little boring — <em>Mockingjay</em> was enough exploration of the "war celebrity" for me — though June and Day's story, despite everything, is a little brighter than Katniss' battle angst.<br /><br />Overall, the motivations for each character were pretty well-done in <em>Prodigy</em>. I wish there had been a little more pattern to it — for example, at some point Tess asks Day, "If it were between me and June, who would you save?" Day answers, and though Day does later make a choice between June and the rebellion, this question made me expect and want a high-stress situation where Day's true feelings between Tess and June were pressured out of him.<br /><br /><em>Prodigy</em>! More cheesecake to enjoy. I like the direction it took with making neither side of the Republic/Colonies war ideal — in fact, both sides were pretty repugnant — and I'm excited to see where the last book will go.</div>

It contained all my favorite ingredients: dystopian surroundings (also known as a delicious yet crumbly crust), two main characters who are "specialists" at their game (the sugar),  who are additionally enemies of each other <em>and also love interests ahhhh</em> (the cheese).<br /><br />That being said, though I enjoyed reading it, there were things that could have been better. There doesn't seem to be any real purpose to why the Republic is in a dystopian/corrupt state, only some hand-waving about factions like "the Colonies" and the "Patriots," all of whom struggle against one another for vague territorial reasons. The youth of the Republic are all forced to go through "Trials" to determine their future, but there's no strong underlying reason <em>why</em>. Occasionally there are references to a mysterious pre-dystopian country regarded with awe -- a flag comprised of thirteen red and white stripes with fifty dots on a blue rectangle, an ancient coin that reads <em>In God We Trust</em> -- but that's about it. Why are people fighting for this by-gone era? Why are they regarding old quarters as precious? I guess we'll figure out in the next book?<br /><br />Another thing: one of the characters later is revealed to have a "dominant ethnicity" of "Mongolian," but is still blonde-haired and blue-eyed, which is bewildering to say the least. I'm not saying that Asian people are never born without blonde hair or blue eyes, but given the context of this book in its genre and in our society, where Asian people are often absent or played by white people, this particular Mongolian character ends up feeling uncomfortably "exotic."<br /><br />The book is told from the alternating first-person perspectives of "June" and "Day," which was okay, though both characters are so similar that I'm not sure I would have been able to tell them apart if the font face and color hadn't also alternated with each voice. A significant feature of both characters is their extreme attention to detail, which is fun, but also feels misused at times; there must have been at least three people which were noted as left-handed, not because left-handedness meant anything, but just to illustrate <em>again</em> how observative the main characters were, in case you'd forgotten. Aside from that, the story is easy to read, and filled with tasty drama.<br /><br />In conclusion: Legend is good cheesecake.</div>
