This past Superbowl Sunday a subset of ex-Dathouse roommates (plus me) got together, ate some chips, and had a draft!<br /><br />We went with three packs of Dark Ascension, which was a little &#8220;meh&#8221; since I feel unimpressed by DA rares. &nbsp;My first was a Fiend of Shadows that I passed up for a Lingering Souls. &nbsp;My second was Flayer of the Hatebound, and my third was Havengul Lich, which would have been<i>&nbsp;really</i>&nbsp;nice to open first&#8230;.aahhh. &nbsp;As it was, I had already drafted green/red/white, which is what I find myself doing 90% of the time. &nbsp;(But man, can you imagine a deck revolving around Havengul Lich and Hatebound? &nbsp;That would have been so fun! &nbsp;Casting low-cost creatures from the graveyard just to deal damage with Hatebound&#8230;I&#8217;d even passed on a Curse of Bloodletting at some point.)<br /><br />I started off unreasonably salty because Andy at my right had picked up all the Immerwolves I had hoped to get, but I ended up finishing second (to Andy!). &nbsp;I had three Nearheath Stalkers and a couple Flings which (when equipped with an Executioner&#8217;s Hood against a blue/black deck) put in the work.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HJlK3_DP4G0/TzDL7kJQ8GI/AAAAAAAAAo8/irHnIqXOBWA/s1600/nearheath-stalker.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HJlK3_DP4G0/TzDL7kJQ8GI/AAAAAAAAAo8/irHnIqXOBWA/s320/nearheath-stalker.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">have you ever looked closely at this art? &nbsp;it&#8217;s terrifying (<a href="http://theroundtablet.com/2012/01/10/nearheath-stalker-by-michael-c-hayes/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Since I didn&#8217;t have the Immerwolves, I experimented splashing white for a Niblis of the Urn, a pair of Burden of Guilts, and a Curse of Exhaustion, which I just wanted to play with. &nbsp;I managed to get it out once, but not during any clutch games. &nbsp;At the end of it all, Andou noted that in draft people often spend a lot of their mana playing one heavy drop during their turn, rendering something like Curse of Exhaustion not as useful.</div>

<i>This quarter I am facilitating a game design class at Puget Sound Community School for fun and lols. &nbsp;This is my story.</i><br /><br /><i>Other weeks can be found <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">here</a>.</i><br /><br />Last week&#8217;s game was <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/587905">/ ESCAPE \</a>. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a simple yet compelling game; you press the escape key to wall-jump, timing it right so you don&#8217;t get&nbsp;electrocuted&nbsp;by spikes embedded by the walls or the huge laser approaching you from the bottom.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_rajI-3FEw/T0pxVu3Q9mI/AAAAAAAAArg/iUKjsetx2c4/s1600/escapescreen.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_rajI-3FEw/T0pxVu3Q9mI/AAAAAAAAArg/iUKjsetx2c4/s400/escapescreen.png" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of / ESCAPE \</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The students said they could feel a sense of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>, and that when they lost, it was in a way so brief and shameless that they found themselves launching right back into the game again without really feeling like they had ever &#8220;stopped&#8221; playing. &nbsp;The fact that the music continued to play on even after death contributed to this, and someone pointed out that the background music made them want to tap ESC to the beat, which was relevant, because the topic of the day was sound.<br /><br />I started with asking what games they felt had strong &#8220;sound design,&#8221; whatever that means, and people listed off games like Metroid and Limbo for its sense of loneliness, Bioshock for its background music immersing you into its bygone pseudo-golden era. &nbsp;Andou supplied me with a particularly moving section of Limbo with which to show the class and everyone shuddered appreciatively.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/i3wmQb7LWZc" width="560"></iframe></center><br /><br />Some applications of sound that I found presented on the internets, as well as some that we brainstormed:<br /><br /><ul><li>Sound can make you feel emotional &#8211; sad, afraid, victorious</li><li>Sound can be used as positive or negative feedback &#8211; <i>You did something right!</i> &nbsp;Or, <i>NO, STOP IT</i></li><li>Sound can be used to give NPCs life, i.e. when they look over at your character dashing by them in a loud rush</li><li>Sound can be used as a reward, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgjHZa6Ag58">a la Zelda</a></li></ul>I also found and presented parts of&nbsp;<a href="http://cruiseelroy.net/2011/06/portal-2-music/">this very lovely breakdown</a>&nbsp;of what makes the music in Portal 2 so delightful and downright wonderful, which was good especially for me since I consider myself not extremely music-savvy, and I think would be hard-pressed at times to think about music and the effect that it&#8217;s having on me and my psyche. &nbsp;Contrast with Andou, who at any given moment during a game or movie will remark something like, &#8220;Oh look, it&#8217;s an intimate moment because romantic music is playing,&#8221; and I&#8217;ll realize that oh right, there <i>is</i>&nbsp;music playing.<br /><br />Following that article, I talked about encoded and embodied sounds, the ~*Universal Language*~ of music and how music in games, rather than speaking about the actions occurring <i>now</i>, may be more important in telling the player what will happen <i>next</i>: in the case of Limbo especially, blaring horns signal significant events, echoing splashes mean you&#8217;re moving deeper into an enormous lonely world.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xpmvxtRvu9E/TzDJwo1gXCI/AAAAAAAAAo0/XXvw6iYdY3Q/s1600/wordloops.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto;

something called <a href="http://axcho.com/wordloops">Wordloops</a>, based on this year&#8217;s theme of &#8220;ouroboros.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is that you connect words together, starting the next word on the letter the previous word ended with, and after you fill certain criteria you &#8220;complete the loop&#8221; and proceed on to Loop N+1. &nbsp;Alex told me that it&#8217;s much better to make loops of small words, since you&#8217;re trying to get the most loops out of 3 minutes of play, but I personally found it really satisfying to make nice, long, wandering loops, and one of the students helped me see why: it&#8217;s because when you type a letter, a sound plays, and that sound goes higher the more letters you play. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the sound of <i>increasing</i>, <i>progressing,</i>&nbsp;<i>getting better</i>. &nbsp;And it&#8217;s at odds with the idea that<i>&nbsp;the smaller loop is best</i>.<br /><br />Sounds!<br /><b><br /></b><br /><b>Sources</b><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2263/gdc_2005_report_what_makes_music_.php">Gamasutra: GDC 2005 Report: What Makes Music for Games &#8216;Music For Games&#8217;</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2232/postcard_from_gdc_2005_gdc_mobile_.php">Gamasutra:&nbsp;Postcard From GDC 2005: GDC Mobile - Novel Ways to Use Audio in Games</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2189/enhancing_the_impact_of_music_in_.php">Gamasutra: Enhancing the Impact of Music in Drama-Oriented Games</a></li></ul></div>

I&#8217;ve started another story. &nbsp;I&#8217;m confident about this one. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t finish last year&#8217;s <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/2011-nanowrimo-limning.html">NaNo</a>&nbsp;but I&#8217;m&nbsp;placing my palms on it, shoving and shoving until its sputum can be resurrected as a passable plot.<br /><br />Mmm.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve discovered (not unexpectedly) that writing on the computer is, for me, a lost cause. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MyzI0jY_Bzk/TytZ60DNvkI/AAAAAAAAAos/Ch2z_vwGufc/s1600/472d84164e1a11e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MyzI0jY_Bzk/TytZ60DNvkI/AAAAAAAAAos/Ch2z_vwGufc/s320/472d84164e1a11e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i&#8217;m going to run out of moleskine soon</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There are too many distractions. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been weaned too well to the Information Age. &nbsp;A newly-transferred Twitter packet is the sweetest nectar. &nbsp;The &#8220;(1)&#8221; notification that appears to the left of the title of my Facebook tab sends my endorphins flying (though 90% of the time it&#8217;s just a request from CastleVille).<br /><br />I&#8217;ve also started assembling a playlist of songs Pandora has suggested to me, which I&#8217;ve found surprisingly stirring of the misery-hope emotions that fuel my inspiration so well. &nbsp;You can find it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD2A04B5DCB06A2D9">here</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLD2A04B5DCB06A2D9&amp;hl=en_US" width="560"></iframe></center><br /><br />Last but not least, an excerpt which I hope won&#8217;t jinx my endeavors:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;It will feel better once you open your eyes,&#8221; Candle suggested, sounding shameful now, &#8220;sorry I can&#8217;t keep it smooth,&#8221; but though Win indeed felt sick, she couldn&#8217;t bring herself to do it &#8211; to open her eyes, to look down and realize that she was miles away from home.  If she fell, how long would it take for her to return?  To fall past Quartzal and Agatava and all of Tenor Anthem, the journey that had taken days in elevators, in short trains weaving on zippered tracks past caves of stationary monsters, in carriages fixed to the back of cliffdragons whose gangly shoulderblades made the entire carriage sway as they navigated aggressive granite striae.  The journey of days could be undone in hours of freefall.  Minutes, if she didn&#8217;t hit anything.</blockquote></div>

It says that you can borrow a book a month, but I think (<em>think</em>) that you can borrow a single book per month, but return it if you want to get another book before the time is up.  I am unclear on this and cannot completely verify yet, having difficulties finding the answer and also having not loaned out anything for a complete month yet.  The collection is enormous and what you&#8217;ll notice about it immediately is the presence of The Hunger Games, the poster child of the Lending Library, a little medal of, <em>Look!  There are even recent, popular books here!  For free (for $49/year)!</em><br /><br /><h3>  You can borrow ebooks from the Seattle Public Library.</h3>The waiting lists are long, but there are enough &#8220;unpopular&#8221; books to tide you over until the holds let up.  You can have holds on 25 books maximum.  You can borrow 25 books maximum, each for up to 21 days maximum.  Here&#8217;s the tricky thing that took me an annoying while to figure out: returning books is not done through the Seattle Public Library&#8217;s <a href="http://spl.lib.overdrive.com/">online site</a>, but through the &#8220;Manage Your Kindle&#8221; link on Amazon.com.<br /><br />Browsing the ebook collection is also frustratingly tedious &#8211; more on that later.  Suffice to say that browsing ebooks is something I reserve for mindlessly doing between builds.<br /><br /><h3>  There are tons of public domain books available on Amazon for free.</h3>They are odds and ends of things, but I really enjoy random tidbits like <em>Character</em> and <em>Home Vegetable Gardening -a Complete and Practical Guide to the Planting and Care of All Vegetables, Fruits and Berries Worth Growing for Home Use</em>, so, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/The%20http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;node=154606011&amp;redirect=true&amp;sort=daterank&amp;field-price=0-0">there</a> you go!</div>

<i>This quarter I am facilitating a game design class at Puget Sound Community School for fun and lols. &nbsp;This is my story.</i><br /><br /><i>Other weeks can be found <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">here</a>.</i><br /><br />I&#8217;m a little belated with this post, if not just because I personally felt &#8220;meh&#8221; about it (which probably means that it might have been worse for the students themselves). &nbsp;Firstly, we critiqued Making Monkeys.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eyjfrSSrYVU/Tyd9DbYC5xI/AAAAAAAAAoc/HBrzqgLtUhs/s1600/makingmonkeys.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="460" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eyjfrSSrYVU/Tyd9DbYC5xI/AAAAAAAAAoc/HBrzqgLtUhs/s640/makingmonkeys.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of making monkeys, by <a href="http://greg-anims.com/">greg-anims</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />The general consensus was that it was fun, unique, challenging. &nbsp;We pointed out the nice progression of the levels &#8211; each one had something new to learn &#8211; and talked about the types of rewards and goals in the design: the short-term win of the coffee cup, the long-term win of the entire game with your progress laid out visibly. &nbsp;The little narratives acted as both a silly reward for the previous level and a hint for the upcoming level. &nbsp;Some students found bugs but I didn&#8217;t write any of them down, so they&#8217;re Lost in Time and Space now.<br /><br />I couldn&#8217;t think of a topic that I felt like discussing, so I chose <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2006/03/performance_met.html">this article</a> at random from a list of game design resources <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/">Alex</a> gave me and just tried to talk about it, whiteboard and all. &nbsp;It was not too compelling and people were distracted, probably because &#8220;me talking&#8221; wasn&#8217;t that intriguing.<br /><br />I switched topics then to the difference between &#8220;hardcore&#8221; and &#8220;casual&#8221; gaming, just to see what people thought of it (again referencing <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2007/08/game-literacy.html">another article from Only a Game</a>). &nbsp;Some of the students were adamant that the labels didn&#8217;t mean anything, that &#8220;people just love games&#8221; and stereotypes seek to destroy the simple, human integrity of us all, to which I agree, kinda. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve always felt something snubby about declarations of <i>I&#8217;m a hardcore gamer </i>when all the game companies I&#8217;ve worked at have legitimate, game-loving audiences who can play just as much as any COD player, just doesn&#8217;t relish the violence or complexity of it.<br /><br />An interesting term I learned in relation to the hardcore/casual duality was the idea of &#8220;game literacy;&#8221; that maybe an important delineation between hardcore and casual is not necessarily the time spent playing, or the motivations, but the breadth of game knowledge in general, and the ease with which one could pick up another game.<br /><br />Another idea was &#8220;game depth,&#8221; and I tried to tie this together with ideas of winning and losing from earlier &#8211; what happens in games when you &#8220;never really lose,&#8221; but just have opportunities to achieve better, a la Angry Birds? &nbsp;What kind of decisions can you make in a game that is shallow, and one that has depth? &nbsp;How important are those decisions to the game itself? &nbsp;In Angry Birds, you can choose your angle and your velocity; in Tetris, your rotatation and speed; in a game like Magic, you can choose your deck, your strategy, your technique. &nbsp;It always seems like games with depth are &#8220;better,&#8221; but I adore Limbo and concede that it&#8217;s shallow gameplay-wise &#8211; you solve the puzzles, you get to the end, that&#8217;s it. &nbsp;I love story, but &#8220;Game&#8221; in its unique form is something that can be cooked and devoured a thousand times and still taste different the thousand and first.</div>

We went to Greenlake Games first with a couple of friends, where every table had a nice mat and every participant received a nifty Companion Cube-looking <a href="http://irondie.com/">Irondie</a>.<br /><br />Sealed competitions go like this:<br /><ol><li>Get 6 packs of cards (in this case, 3 of Dark Ascension, 3 of Innistrad)</li><li>Open everything</li><li>Make a 40-card deck</li><li>FIGHT</li></ol>First pack rare: Geist of Saint Traft.  <em>AHHHH</em>.  And in the same pack: Instigator Gang!<br /><br />I was also excited to try and get some <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/01/mtg-lambholt-elder.html">Lambholt Elders</a> and ended up just getting three of them in all of my Dark Ascension packs (and even a holographic one!).<br /><br />In the end I created a green/white deck splashing both blue and red for Geist and Instigator.  I&#8217;ve never tried to use four colors before and felt super risky (oftentimes I would take a 5-mana hand just because I had all the colors in it), but when I was not completely mana-screwed I actually did fairly well!  I won three of my four sets and won six extra booster packs.<br /><br />Some memorable moments:<br /><ul><li>In one game: I attacked with Pitchburn Devils, dealt 3 damage to the other player, then next turn brought Pitchburn back with Haunted Fengraf, sacrificed him to equip Somberwald Dryad with Demonmail Hauberk, dealt 3 damage to the other player, then swung with Somberwald who was unblockable due to Forestwalk.  The last point of damage was done by casting Fling and sacrificing my 1/2 Lambholt Elder, haha.</li><li>In my last game: me and the other player were down to <em>dat wire</em>, him with a Galvanic Juggernaut that kept coming back upright with the undying death of his Young Wolf.  I took three hits for 15 damage from the Juggernaut but then was at exactly 5 health, which triggered the Fateful Hour of my Thraben Doomsayer and buffed both my Silverpelt Werewolf and Somberwald Dryad.  It was close until Andou came by to check out our game and realized that we had both forgotten all about the Fateful hour for the Village Survivors that I had out, since it was covered up by a Chant of the Skifsang &#8211; at which point I swung with all my Vigilant creatures and it was over.</li><li>In another game: my first hand had two plains, three forests, a Thraben Doomsayer, and a Gravetiller Wurm.  Over the course of the next couple turns I spawned a human, brought Gravetiller in with Morbid, equipped him with a Demonmail Hauberk and some more Morbid counters thanks to a Hunger of the Howlpack and another human token, and, there it was: a massive 15/13 monster trampling everywhere.</li></ul><br />I have Lorin to thank for making full use of Demonmail, since he cleaned me out with it at <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/12/mtg-my-second-ever-draft.html">our last draft</a> and before that point I hadn&#8217;t made the connection between Demonmail and how easy it made triggering Morbid since I could sacrifice a creature whenever I wished.  Andou read some of the design notes for this set to me; the point of Dark Ascension is that everything is getting dark and awful and worse, the world is teeming with monsters, and I definitely felt the design encouraging me to kill things, to take advantage of death, especially of that of meager 1/1 Human tokens.  Fateful Hour was also fun to trigger, though being at the point of death stresses me out, and in general during all the games playing with strangers I could feel my hands shaking with competitive tension.<br /><br />Later our group went over to The Dreaming to do <em>another</em> sealed tourney, but I didn&#8217;t do so well in that one, so, the only memorable moment I&#8217;ve got is when Andou pulled a Huntmaster of the Fells and later gave it to me.  Dark Ascension werewolves, here I come!<br /><br /><br /><b>Decklist</b><br /><i>Creatures</i><br />3x Lambholt Elder<br />1x Pitchburn Devils<br />1x Instigator Gang<br />1x Geistcatcher&#8217;s Rig<br />1x Village Survivors<br />1x Gravetiller Wurm<br />1x Somberwald Dryad<br />1x Thraben Doomsayer<br />1x Geist of Saint Traft<br /><br /><i>Spells/Artifacts</i><br />1x Fling<br />1x Gather the Townsfolk<br />1x Hunger of the Howlpack<br />1x Ghostly Possession<br />1x Skillful Lunge<br />1x Curse of Stalked Prey<br />1x Burning Oil<br />1x Demonmail Hauberk<br />1x Midnight Haunting<br />1x Bonds of Faith<br /><i><br /></i><i>Lands</i><br />6x Forest<br />6x Plains<br />3x Island <br />2x Mountain<br />1x Evolving Wilds<br />1x Haunted Fengraf</div>

The Mexican character was, unfortunately, the subject of many a boob-shot, and was also pretty frustratingly&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere">tsundere</a>&nbsp;at times; and in general the females all had the same, petite facial structure. &nbsp;Personality-wise, though, they were all strong and interesting, with motives that 100% did not involve getting with the men around them. &nbsp;(Though there was a bit of Maria/That Dark Brooding guy near the end&#8230;before he went back to his lifestyle of alternating between doing surgeries and jail-time.)<br /><br />Some bonus fangirling: the best part of this game, hands-down, were Kimishima&#8217;s cases. &nbsp;I <i>loved</i>&nbsp;piecing together the facts, figuring out how someone had died (though most of them were pretty straight-forward), learning about Kimishima&#8217;s weird &#8220;I can hear the dead&#8221; cellphone and the fact that other characters accepted that she had such a device without complaint (&#8220;You and your voodoo cellphone&#8230;&#8221;). &nbsp;Gabe Cunningham&#8217;s voice actor (apparently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Willingham">the same as for Roy in Full Metal Alchemist</a>) had <i>so much life</i>&nbsp;(the best part being when he sang &#8220;chunky~~&#8221; at the American politician). &nbsp;Also, Atlus&#8217;s bold, colorful interfaces are so&nbsp;fun to interact with.</div></div>

<i>This quarter I am facilitating a game design class at Puget Sound Community School for fun and lols. &nbsp;This is my story.</i><br /><br /><i>Other weeks can be found <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">here</a>.</i><br /><br />First thing last Tuesday was going over last week&#8217;s assigned game, <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/586994">Pixel 2</a>, which has some marvelously colorful particle effects. &nbsp;Since we had talked a bit about <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/01/pscs-game-design-class-week-2.html">tutorials</a>&nbsp;in the past class, I had asked everybody to keep an eye on how Pixel 2 teaches you how to play the game, and it turns out it does so pretty bluntly.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ypu35aRRuI0/Tx4n4pMgrUI/AAAAAAAAAnM/XCTY9HfIHbE/s1600/pixel2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="468" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ypu35aRRuI0/Tx4n4pMgrUI/AAAAAAAAAnM/XCTY9HfIHbE/s640/pixel2.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">pixel 2 tutorial screenshot</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Everyone agreed that the game was &#8220;pretty fun,&#8221; mostly because it was very satisfying to collect the pixels, and people enjoyed the way that pixels were shot out at enemies anytime you collected pixels. &nbsp;We also discovered the &#8220;teleportation&#8221; aspect of the game, but were mixed about whether it added to the game or not. &nbsp;The player is moved around with the mouse, and can be held stationary with the space bar while the mouse moves the gun around, shooting at surrounding enemies; but if you release the space bar, the player will automatically &#8220;teleport&#8221; to the mouse&#8217;s present position.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t get that far in the game due to lack of time and the fact that all the particles make my laptop run slowly, but the students also pointed out that some of the upgrades obtained in the game later are unlabeled, so their function is hard to remember.<br /><br />After that, we moved on to the topic for the day, which was reward systems. &nbsp;I referenced a lot of <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2005/08/designing_rewar.html">this overview on reward types</a>, though the students were able to name off some rewards easily: leveling up, getting money, getting new items, getting to explore new places. &nbsp;I talked about schedules for rewards, as well as what I felt was a pretty interesting point from that article:<br /><br /><blockquote>If you have ever wondered why games with poor game mechanics can still entertain players, it is perhaps because many poorly designed games are at least easy to play - and if they provide rewards according to a reliable schedule, they will entertain&#8230;it is the delivery of rewards, and not the quality of the game mechanics, which maintains a player&#8217;s interest.</blockquote><br />Case in point: &nbsp;FarmVille, and other games nowadays like EA&#8217;s Theme Park which rely on people optimizing for rewards (described with a fair amount of pessimism in <a href="http://insertcredit.com/2011/09/22/who-killed-videogames-a-ghost-story/">who killed video games?</a>).<br /><br />The next thing I talked about was how the rewards mentioned above were all extrinsic motivations, contrasted with intrinsic motivations, detailed wonderfully in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">this TEDTalk about &#8220;the surprising science of motivation&#8221;</a>:<br /><br /><br /><center><object height="374" width="526"> <param name="movie" value="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf"> </param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /> <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/> <param name="wmode" value="transparent"> </param><param name="bgColor" value="#ffffff"> </param><param name="flashvars" value="vu=http://video.ted.com/talk/stream/2009G/Blank/DanielPink_2009G-320k.mp4&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/DanielPink-2009G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&vw=512&vh=288&ap=0&ti=618&lang=&introDuration=15330&adDuration=4000&postAdDuration=830&adKeys=talk=dan_pink_on_motivation;year=2009;theme=the_creative_spark;theme=not_business_as_usual;event=TEDGlobal+2009;tag=Business;tag=Science;tag=brain;tag=creativity;tag=social+change;tag=work;&preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;" /> <embed src="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" pluginspace="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" bgColor="#ffffff" width="526" height="374" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" flashvars="vu=http://video.ted.com/talk/stream/2009G/Blank/DanielPink_2009G-320k.mp4&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/DanielPink-2009G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&vw=512&vh=288&ap=0&ti=618&lang=&introDuration=15330&adDuration=4000&postAdDuration=830&adKeys=talk=dan_pink_on_motivation;year=2009;theme=the_creative_spark;theme=not_business_as_usual;event=TEDGlobal+2009;tag=Business;tag=Science;tag=brain;tag=creativity;tag=social+change;tag=work;&preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;"></embed> </object></center><br /><br />As soon as I described the candle problem one of the students yelled, &#8220;What?! &nbsp;But that&#8217;s easy!&#8221; right off the bat, so I guess it just goes to show you how they&#8217;ve already been brought up with fancy intrinsic motivations (or maybe it just proves that I shouldn&#8217;t have drawn the box first, and then the tacks inside the box).<br /><br />Last topic was goals, the discussion of which I also referenced <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2007/05/process_without.html">Only a Game</a>&nbsp;as well as relevant HCI/UX points like <i>Show your player how far they&#8217;ve gotten! &nbsp;Show them all the things they&#8217;ve done! &nbsp;Short-term goals and long-term goals and transparent progress, yeah!</i><br /><br />With most topics I usually stop to let everyone try and see what video games may exhibit characteristics of whatever I&#8217;m talking about, which leads inevitably to fun tangential discussion about WoW, about achievements, about gamification and whether it works or not. &nbsp;The only unfortunate thing is that I haven&#8217;t played most of the games that they have, since the only console I own that came out in the past seven years is the Wii. &nbsp;Even playing flash games stresses out the machines I own.<br /><br />Another thing I learned personally is this: even if the class is going to be mostly discussion and mostly me talking, even if there&#8217;s no formal note-taking or tests, it&#8217;s<i>&nbsp;good </i>to be writing stuff on the board. &nbsp;The moment I markered out &#8220;extrinsic&#8221; people looked up from their laptop screens. &nbsp;Hurray!</div>
