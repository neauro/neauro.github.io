I"Ş<p>I have my first publication out in <a href="https://solarpunkmagazine.com">Solarpunk Magazine</a>!</p>

<p>It was written for their May 2022 Microfiction Contest, which was themed â€œSolarpunk in Asia and the Pacific Islands.â€ I wrote it fresh off finishing Alex G. Pacmanâ€™s <em>Filipino Ghost Stories</em>, and wanted to mix ghost stories with the solarpunk aesthetic and a healthy dose of diaspora mango angst.</p>

<p>Recently Iâ€™ve been really interested in solarpunk and utopian stories; given The Times theyâ€™re especially soothing.</p>
