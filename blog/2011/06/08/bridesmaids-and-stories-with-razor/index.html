There were a ton of parts that were so awkward it was painful to watch (in a good way, I suppose).  I didn&#8217;t mind to much while watching it, but afterward, talking about the story with Jimmy and Mari on the way home, it seemed to us that there was still a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Jimmy for one is a huge proponent of <a href="http://www.imyjimmy.com/post/3420065648/originality-vs-focus">focus in stories</a>, and thinks that every movie should have an <strong>armature</strong>, which is essentially &#8220;the moral of the story.&#8221; The armature for The Godfather, for example, is that &#8220;Your family defines you.&#8221;<br /><br />Throughout the entirety of Bridesmaids, the main character, Annie, appears to struggle with her negative outlook and lack self-confidence.  She&#8217;s in a relationship with a clearly douche-y guy who doesn&#8217;t care about her, she struggles with another character who appears to be stealing her best friend away, she ends up pushing away the people who <em>do</em> care about her because of her own pessimism.  Things begin to look up for her when she does decide to think positively, which occurs after her last, enormous mad outburst, and (apparently) due to one of her other &#8220;friends&#8221; tackling Annie on the couch and slapping her until Annie fought for herself.<br /><br />If you&#8217;ve been depressed and thinking negatively for months, Jimmy pointed out, thinking positively doesn&#8217;t come easily.  It takes a little more than a fat woman to beat you up on your furniture to make you think positively.<br /><br />And once she does think positively, the solutions to all her problems just fell into her lap.  Sure, she attempted and seemed to fail at apologizing to her love interest after wronging him &#8211; but that&#8217;s only a small step out of the comfort zone that she&#8217;s been hissing herself into the entire movie.  It&#8217;s true that she never had to overcome anything greater than herself for the entire movie, but if doing so was so easy, why didn&#8217;t it just happen fifteen minutes in?<br /><br />If a good movie should have focus, if every scene of it should mean something (much like how every sentence should mean something in <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/06/her-will-short-story-for-au-iii-legacy.html">a short story</a>), and a big theme, then this movie fell something short of &#8220;good.&#8221; There seemed to be a lot of things that didn&#8217;t really mean anything &#8211; for instance, why was Annie a baker?  The majority of the things that she did in that movie were completely unrelated to baking, and she only ever baked anything in two scenes.  The first time that she baked something, it was after she met her love interest, and because he admitted he was a neighbor, I thought: Would she give it to her love interest?  But no: she just looked at it, then ate it.<br /><br />What is that supposed to mean?  Does she bake to try and calm herself?  If so, why doesn&#8217;t she do it the other times that she panics during the movie?  Was she thinking about giving it to the love interest, and then was too afraid to do so?<br /><br />Why was it important for Annie to be a baker?  Was it just so that she could have a failed start-up, to show that she had ambition but had been broken by her failure?  If so, couldn&#8217;t there have been a better way to do this, without giving her a completely superfluous label as &#8220;baker&#8221;?  Or, if she definitely is a baker, why wouldn&#8217;t this show through in other aspects of her life?  She doesn&#8217;t have recipe books.  She doesn&#8217;t comment about the food that she eats.  She doesn&#8217;t appear to have anything super baker-y in her room, which in a few shots is nice and elegant but completely lacking in description of the type of character that she is.  People&#8217;s rooms can be the greatest indicator of what type of person they are &#8211; clean, messy, cluttered &#8211; my roommate&#8217;s typography decorations and shelves of comic books speak differently than my wall of folded-up paper chopstick-covers and small shelve stuffed with PS2 games.  Mariko has a wire shelf of animu and Sakuracon badges.  Jimmy has a triplet of monitors for his computer, Molly&#8217;s desk and windowsill is lined with classics and books about healthy eating.<br /><br />As Jimmy texted, a couple minutes ago: <em>Never have a batman movie that can also be a superman movie.  Character must be intrinsic to plot.  Annie could&#8217;ve been anything.</em><br /><br />Which means, really, that she wasn&#8217;t anything.<br /><br />There were a lot of other unnecessary parts &#8211; Annie&#8217;s mother maybe finding a new partner at the end, two of the bridesmaids becoming completely irrelevant at the end of the movie, so on.  Anyway, it&#8217;s a funny movie.</div>
