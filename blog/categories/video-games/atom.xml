<p>The trailer was gorgeous and I&rsquo;m a sucker for both folklore and foxes, so I played <a href="http://neveralonegame.com/">Never Alone</a> this weekend. I started on my own and, after getting trapped in an area where character AI wasn&rsquo;t quite cutting it (and kept dropping me into an icy demise), I set up a controller so I could play with a human. (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1l21zb/playing_with_a_ps3_controller_on_pc_a_setup_guide">It&rsquo;s pretty easy, by the way!</a>)</p>

<p>It turned out to be fortunate trouble because the game is much more fun with someone else, though I admit that this could also be because I rarely play multi-player games nowadays and hugely prefer them to be cooperative when I do. The atmosphere and Iñupiaq narration were fantastic, and I loved the subtlety of certain details, such as the little halo of light that emerged from the fox&rsquo;s head whenever a spirit was near. Certain things didn&rsquo;t quite make sense — why do the spirits of the aurora fly away with you? If it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re doing something &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; what is that bad thing you&rsquo;re doing? — but it helps contributes to the surrealism that surrounds old stories.</p>

<p>I only wish the game was longer than the three hours it took us to complete it. Hopefully it&rsquo;s successful enough to warrant the creation of further chapters, and inspires others to find new ways to share their cultural stories as well. I know I&rsquo;d love to see a game with the Filipino pantheon, despite (or even because) of its incredible diversity and tension with Christianity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I always said before that I was busy with school but it doesn&rsquo;t compare at all to the amount of work I have now, just a couple weeks until graduation. AAAAHHH</p>

<p>Lots has been happening. Even so, I&rsquo;ve been posting pretty frequently on <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> (as it requires less effort and being able to arrange photos nicely is fun).</p>

<p>In particular I&rsquo;ve been working on my Capstone project, Bubble, an app to faciliate easier sharing of photos and messages between iPhone users using mesh networking (the same kind that <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/525921/the-latest-chat-app-for-iphone-needs-no-internet-connection/">Firechat</a> has been making use of). I&rsquo;ve been writing about my team&rsquo;s progress in our own <a href="http://hcdeevee.tumblr.com/">process blog</a>, and I&rsquo;ve also posted <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/code-eevee">in-progress stuff</a> about my own sketches and experiments with Sketch 3 and Flinto. Sketch 3 is fantastic, and I find myself opening it even when I just need to do a couple quick photo edits. Flinto is also great, though I&rsquo;m disappointed that I&rsquo;ll probably never &ldquo;really&rdquo; use it after my trial runs out, because $20 a month is a little much for someone who just wants to play with flows that I won&rsquo;t get paid for. I wish there was a way to pay up front and only have one active project or something. As it is, I&rsquo;m keeping an eye on <a href="http://proto.io/">Proto.io</a> and <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel App</a> for future playing. (Though I still loove <a href="https://popapp.in/">Pop App</a> right now for interactive paper prototyping.)</p>

<p>Other than capstone work, I&rsquo;ve also been working on a lot of fun design projects for my Interaction Design class this quarter, which I&rsquo;ll post about separately later.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been writing a ton! A month ago the &ldquo;Plague&rdquo; theme edition of <a href="http://strayingfromreality.wordpress.com/">AU</a> was released, which had my story <em>Iron &amp; Honey</em>. It&rsquo;s available currently at Bulldog News.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/ironandhoney.jpg" alt="The first page of 'Iron and Honey'"/></p>

<p class="caption">The first page of <em>Iron &amp; Honey</em></p>


<p>I&rsquo;ve also been working on my Big Story with greater headway than I have before by using the &ldquo;writing scene-by-scene&rdquo; technique which I read about in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=story+robert+mckee+&oq=story+robert+mckee+&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59l4j0.2336j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8"><em>Story</em> by Robert McKee</a>. The way that I’m executing is by writing out each scene with a “beginning state” of certain characters, their “ending” state, and the exposition or other “feeling” work that needs to also happen.</p>

<p>My problem with Big Story is that I love my world and my characters and I know what I want to say, but I have no idea how to say it, and no idea how to get from my known point A to point B. Hopefully working out each step like this will help me actually get somewhere. I’ve had problems dragging mindlessly from A to B with all my previous iterations, but with this kind of technique I can already feel myself becoming more conscious of how to make making meaningful things happen the whole way through.</p>

<p class="caption">yay! things happening!</p>


<p>The final major happening in my life is the release of <a href="http://supergiantgames.com/index.php/transistor/">Transistor</a>! (≧▽≦ I spent the Monday prior its release this week listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KudXO0DO04U&feature=youtu.be&t=5m42s">We All Become</a> on repeat, more of a fangirl about this than any other game than I can think of. I&rsquo;m about 4 hours in and have already had a heart-swelling experience that reduced me into a puddle of sap. I&rsquo;m not done yet but I love it I love it and it&rsquo;s incredibly inspiring. I can only hope the good feels stay until the end.</p>

<p class="caption">(<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/thomas-was-alone/screenshots/gameShotId,566500/">via</a>)</p>


<p><em>Thomas Was Alone</em> was super cute, if more ambiguous than I personally like. I liked the personality given to all the different shapes, though their common heroism and conceit got a little old as the game went on, which was why Laura&rsquo;s cynicism made her my favorite (though I felt compelled inexlicably to keep calling her &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo;). I loved that the levels were tilted, the play of light, the strange colors. (Though I wonder if any colorblind users had a hard time playing?)</p>

<p>One thing I think the game could have been improved was the game&rsquo;s sense of progression; though numbers ticked up each level, after a while they became meaningless, and now that the game is finished I&rsquo;m not totally sure what I would use them for. The introduction of each of the colored shapes, Thomas&rsquo;s &ldquo;death,&rdquo; and the era of the gray shapes seemed to be the largest movements in the story, and though each was accompanied with a fun snippet of &ldquo;The AIs are gaining sentience!&rdquo; flavor I didn&rsquo;t really have a sense that things were reaching their end until the end came suddenly to meet me. Some levels seemed like little &ldquo;drabbles&rdquo; and experiments, which I completed without much more effort than would take for me to click a cow in Farmville, and it would have been cool to see something else related to AIs breaking their previous ways of being. Breaking through the borders of levels — intentionally disobeying orders — something to add to the flavor text.</p>

<p>I played <em>Thomas Was Alone</em> on a projector and if you have the opportunity to do so yourself I recommend it. All those rectangles are like way better when they&rsquo;re as big as your face.</p>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZKxZeym4hI/UnhNh5LTGHI/AAAAAAAAER8/ijPCNF5uWhM/s1600/pokemonxy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZKxZeym4hI/UnhNh5LTGHI/AAAAAAAAER8/ijPCNF5uWhM/s640/pokemonxy.jpg" width="510" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshots of the websites for Pokemon X &amp; Y<br />Japan (above), Netherlands (bottom)</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">A couple weeks ago we analyzed the marketing sites for Pokemon X and Y across different countries. It turns out that all sites for Pokemon X and Y are the same — except for the one in Japan, which is shown at the top of the screenshot above.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The differences between the Japanese site and the rest-of-the-world sites include:</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1"><br /></div><h4>Feature Descriptions</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites contain more information about the game, for example, direct links to features like the Pokemon Global Link; on the Japanese site, these are internal.</div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Hype</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites feature a large image carousel on their homepage, which shows other features of the game, all shown to excite:&nbsp;<i>Discover the Might of Mega-Evolved Pokemon! A New World of Amazing Pokemon!</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div>In contrast, the front page of the Japanese site merely says:&nbsp;<i>Pokemon, heading to a brand new dimension</i>! (Referring, I think, to the 3D?)</div></div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Obvious Marketing</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites contain immediate links to buy the game, as well as the 3DS; the Japanese site does not. (According to Julius, the 2DS isn't even available in Japan, perhaps because "Everyone there already has a 3DS!")</div></div><div><h4><br /></h4><h4>JavaScript</h4><div>The Japanese site has very little Javascript, and each page looks to be straight HTML. Additionally, text is often baked straight into the images, rather than being left as straight text, which is often the case in websites due to accessibility issues. (Text on images cannot be easily parsed by screenreaders. Some users also prefer to render text on websites to be more readable, for example, through the excellent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.beelinereader.com/">BeeLine</a>&nbsp;app.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Description vs. Instruction</h4><div>The Japanese site is more descriptive of the story and characters of the game; the non-Japanese site is more instructive of how to play the Pokemon game.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="p1">We chalked up the majority of the differences the fact that Pokemon is more popular in Japan; Japanese game-players may not need to be particularly taught about Pokemon, or persuaded to buy it. But, this exercise makes me more interested in other facets of Japanese web design. Why is there so much baked-in text, why aren't there fancy hover menu states, why is the design so flat compared to the chrome and bevels of the non-Japanese sites? Is web accessibility less important in the Japanese corner of the internet, or is it handled in a way that's different in the US?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">One final note: out class lecture that week was done by Kate Edwards, current Executive Director of IGDA, who shared some cool stories regarding the "culturization" problems she's encountered when helping to ship games across international borders. Something she noted was that, in the Netherlands, "adult" games don't need to be localized into Dutch because the adults there prefer to play the games in English. So, the fact that the Pokemon X and Y site text is all written in Dutch…</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><br /><div class="p1">…well…you can totally still enjoy the world of Kalos as a grown-up grad student with a full-time job. Just saying!</div></div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VLOhbqzGTUk/UBggO-tiRlI/AAAAAAAAB3g/4k3a6a5Q5kg/s1600/lonesurvivor.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VLOhbqzGTUk/UBggO-tiRlI/AAAAAAAAB3g/4k3a6a5Q5kg/s1600/lonesurvivor.jpg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>0.</h2></div><div class="p1"><i>Lone Survivor </i>was the game I was most excited to obtain through a Humble Indie Bundle months ago, because the big grainy pixels looked so delicious, so fat with mood and atmosphere. And weirdness! And mysteriousness!</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Spoilers ahead.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>1.</h2></div><div class="p1">One of my favorite parts of adventure games is the characterization that rises through interaction with items. Do characters like a certain item, or dislike it? Does the item bring up deep heartbroken memories of the past? How do they parse and react, and what does their rumination say for who they are? I'm reminded of Nancy Drew's endearing enthusiasm for lifting up random objects ("This plastic DNA model will be useful!") and Phoenix Wright's skeptical amusement when things like puppies are added to his inventory.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The most interesting item in the game for me was the toy cat, which I enjoyed petting all the time to accrue invisible "sanity" points. Engaging with the cat toy in particular puts you in the shoes and brain of the lone survivor himself, tinkering with a plush at the end of the world, just to have something light-hearted to do.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>2.</h2></div><div class="p1">Speaking of the cat plush, I loved the detail of this game — the unidentifiable flesh-like substances stretching across the wall — the way your map was dark unless you viewed it under sources of light — the specific food items like Delicious Ham, the creepy bottomless repositories of pills and Rotten Meats.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>3.</h2></div><div class="p1">A criticism of <i>Lone Survivor</i> seems to be that it was not scary enough. I played it at the height of summer and even then it was plenty terrifying, even if most of my stress and fear stemmed from being unable to hoard my bullets as obsessively as I would have liked.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Another scary part: putting your hand in that horrifying pink-red flesh-pixel hole. I <i>really </i>did not want to do that.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>4.</h2></div><div class="p1">The dream sequences were cool, and the characters therein intriguingly surreal, which I loved. Ultimately, however, I didn't feel that these scenes contributed to a larger understanding of what was going on, which was disappointing. Rather than deep, the first ending I received was vague, and a letdown. After carrying and caring for this dude I'd wanted a little more than a whiff of a broken heart. I wanted to know more about what this girl meant to the protagonist, how her departure left his life with zombie-filled corridors.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>5.</h2></div><div class="p1">I got my ending by playing as paragon as possible. I wanted to see if other endings would give me closure, so I found them on Youtube. Each one seemed vaguer than the last, and didn't interest me that much. I don't have a particular love of multiple endings and for me it's because they lack impact: I've only rarely encountered any set that comfortably resolves all issues and tension introduced in the game, and the way that such endings are reached never quite seems to match the decisions you made to get there.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">In the case of <i>Lone Survivor, </i>the decisions that you make add to an invisible calculator which eventually spits out one of these endings: for example, killing more monsters gives you endings that imply you're mentally unstable. But why? What is it about killing these things makes you this way? The worst ending can also be achieved not just by killing monsters, but "eating food when not hungry or hurt" and "sleeping for no reason" (per <a href="http://lonesurvivor.wikia.com/wiki/Endings">this wiki</a>). What's <i>that </i>connection?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>6.</h2></div><div class="p1">This was my other favorite part: getting that white cat to come live with me. I guess it's strange to be saying that after my demands for meaningfulness, since other than the invisible points, hanging out with the cat doesn't reveal any more of the protagonist's inner story. But playing with the cat, I felt for the first time that I was doing something in the game that I personally wanted, like it was really <i>me</i> in there, and not me poking through things in a dude-shaped glove.<br /><br />Come here! Come <i>here</i>, little digital thing!<br /><br /></div><div class="p1"><i>come and be with me forever</i><br /><i><br /></i><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tvhPIy5tDo/UilDcBOQcrI/AAAAAAAAEBc/f6aLd4GxHlk/s1600/Sunny.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tvhPIy5tDo/UilDcBOQcrI/AAAAAAAAEBc/f6aLd4GxHlk/s1600/Sunny.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://lonesurvivor.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><i><br /></i></div></div>
