The last one, around St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, was Green Mocha Cake, and the new one is Candied Carnations, for Mother&#8217;s Day. (There&#8217;s actually a whole slew of Mother&#8217;s Day-themed offerings &#8211; way to play it out to dat hardcore Zynga gamer mothers, haha.)<br /><br />Anyway, apparently when Francine bought one of my surplus Mocha Cakes, I got my Candied Carnation recipe leveled up instead.  Which begs the question &#8211; which was she really buying?  Does the mastery gained from a special recipe that was discontinued just go to whatever the &#8220;present special recipe&#8221; is, if there is one? (I know before when people bought my Mocha Cakes, it leveled up the Mocha Cake, which was nice since, you know, it&#8217;s not like I could level it up myself anymore.)  How does the English FarmVille fit into this equation, now that it has its own special recipe?<br /><br />All these answers and more, maybe this summer. :)</div>

I have to say that when I was making this video, I was impressed by the sheer scale of the reconstruction, and how it&#8217;s even possible to do something like this now just by using pictures.  It&#8217;s even pretty much got the distances in between the buildings.</div>

<br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9CpaPPefPOY" title="YouTube video player" width="510"></iframe></center><br /><br /><b>Edit 11/29: </b>Links to photo galleries can be found in <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/11/sakura-con-2011-cosplay-photos.html">this post</a>!<br /><br />This is a video Timmy found on Youtube by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CpaPPefPOY&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=88">FastMatt</a> which is essentially the only proof (1:27) that I have of cosplaying at this year&#8217;s Con. (Actually, there are a couple pictures, but I&#8217;m kind of dissatisfied with them, and didn&#8217;t really have a chance to take pictures of myself&#8230;) I did Glaceon and &#8211; oh gosh, I just realized I left my costume at the Convention Center&#8230;<br /><br />&#8230;.<br /><br />&#8230;well, it wasn&#8217;t that hard to make. &gt;____&gt;;; It was basically a light blue kimono and some darker portions made with darker blue, all in this sort of quilt fabric that I found at JoAnn&#8217;s. (Quilt fabric is always in much more versatile colors&#8230;) Since I&#8217;ve made gi/kimono-style clothings at least twice before for Con purposes I pretty much just haphazardly threw it together, yet I feel that it&#8217;s my most successful cosplay yet.  Probably because I was with all the other Eevees, and I think we made up a pretty impressive gijinka group. :3<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iFSxbqhfPU4/Tbe03Tey_5I/AAAAAAAAAMc/SpjikTGFJEg/s1600/209229_2037154807629_1206997758_2461459_6895401_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iFSxbqhfPU4/Tbe03Tey_5I/AAAAAAAAAMc/SpjikTGFJEg/s640/209229_2037154807629_1206997758_2461459_6895401_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is kind of an unflattering picture of me, but a good one of everyone else :D</td></tr></tbody></table><br />We had more pro pictures taken by <a href="http://masa-kocha.deviantart.com/">Rachel</a>, an apparently amazing artist and cosplayer from San Francisco who does photography as a hobby.  She&#8217;s uber busy though, so it will probably take a couple months for us to actually get the pictures that she took of us.  (Apparently she&#8217;s putting off photo processing until early June!  Just enough time to forget about them and then be happy to see them later. :D) We scrambled over the stone features of the Washington State Convention Center and afterwards shivered in turns as we waited for Eric to finish taking individual shots of all of us.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wKE3LTKlEVU/Tbe1qzPuf4I/AAAAAAAAAMk/fRD8ct7OVFU/s1600/27041_895203577798_10739505_49066831_899936_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wKE3LTKlEVU/Tbe1qzPuf4I/AAAAAAAAAMk/fRD8ct7OVFU/s400/27041_895203577798_10739505_49066831_899936_n.jpg" width="278" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is a pic that rachel took of some other of merch staff cosplaying blazblue at last year&#8217;s con<br />&#8230;for the sake of having a picture here</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was busier at this Con than any other year before, mostly because of commitments as staff, and a lesser willingness to get up early and take advantage of wandering Con in the morning.  FFXIII and Vocaloid cosplays seemed to be especially popular, or at least, that&#8217;s what I remember the most, aside from the usual smattering of Akatsuki cloaks, and an interesting blend of different video games, including Minecraft, haha.  Also, tons of Hetalia.<br /><br />My favorite thing to do at Con is usually take pictures, but this year I found I wasn&#8217;t quite so interested in wandering and asking cosplayers for their pictures&#8230;maybe because I&#8217;ve become too jaded, or maybe because I&#8217;m just tired of the process itself.  For me the joy of Con now comes mostly just from submerging myself in the atmosphere of it &#8211; the excited fanpeoples, the cosplayers who have worked so hard, the shy people who come out all smooth and soft-spoken from their quiet shells from all corners of Seattle and beyond.<br /><br />It used to be that I would also go for all the stuff you could buy, but I guess I&#8217;ve grown out of that too &#8211; just &#8211; can&#8217;t think of anything to buy.  That being said, I never used to enjoy Artist Alley, but I think I&#8217;ve finally decided that it&#8217;s another one of my favorite parts of Con &#8211; being there has such a clean, nice, inspiring feeling, unlike being in the general dealer&#8217;s room.  I bought a beautiful print from Zilva and a poster for Andou from Han Tseng, from <a href="http://directionsofdestiny.com/">Directions of Destiny</a> (which I started reading <em>soooo long ago!</em> Guess it&#8217;s time to check up on it again).  I actually grabbed the poster on Sunday; I went back home for Easter celebrations and then rushed from the terminal to fifth floor, where I located Han Tseng&#8217;s booth, already 90% taken down&#8230;luckily he was nice enough to pull out a poster for me despite.<br /><br />Also this year at Con, I had my picture taken by a DSi for the first time. I wonder what I would have thought of such a thing back when I started attending in 2006&#8230;that handhelds and cellphones have become common cameras is just crazy.<br /><br />So, in summary: Con was great!  Can&#8217;t wait for the next one. :D</div>

It swerves dangerously close to racist statements sometimes (&#8220;the French language&#8230;romantic and <em>spirituel</em> but also, of course, the paragon of logic and clarity;&#8221; sure, but have you really studied other languages, or is this whole book going to be European-centric?), but the tone is pretty subjective and the discussion (at least for now) goes deeper than pure labeling.  <span class="shh">And at some point he mentioned Tagalog, which made me really happy :D :D It&#8217;s always a shock when I learn non-Filipino know Tagalog people &#8211; even now, it&#8217;s like, <em>Why?</em> Derek once explained to me that he thinks Japanese people feel the same way, which is why they were always so shocked when we showed up all Nihongo.  <em>Why would you bother learning Japanese?!</em></span><br /><br />Anyway, the most interesting part thus far talks about this guy named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>, who was eloquent but not considered completely sane by his contemporaries due to his fervored attempts to connect the Greek pantheon to Christian religious figures.  In reading Homer&#8217;s works, he realized that Homer has a strange treatment of color: he hardly uses it.  Example: for almost anyone, the sea is blue.  But to Homer it is &#8220;wine-looking&#8221; &#8211; just as oxen are.  And just as iron is.  But his treatment of color is also inconsistent:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;Iron&#8230;is said to be &#8216;violet&#8217; in one passage, &#8216;gray&#8217; elsewhere, and in yet another place it is referred to as <em>aithon</em>, a term otherwise used to refer to the color of horses, lions, and oxen.&#8221;</blockquote><br />It turns out the key is in the fact that Homer references &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;white&#8221; 270 times, whereas the references to other colors put together is hardly anything.<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;He may often talk about light and brightness, but seldom does he venture beyond gray scale into the splendor of prism.  In those instances when colors are mentioned, they are often vague and highly inconsistent: his sea is wine-colored, and when not wine-colored, it is violet, just like his sheep.  His honey is green and his southern sky is anything but blue&#8230;.&#8221;</blockquote><br />And that&#8217;s the key, I guess: Homer saw the world not so much in colors as they did in lightnesses and darknesses.  The rest of the Greeks did as well, since &#8220;violet-colored hair&#8221; is seen in other Greek poetry in ancient times.<br /><br />As it turns out, the world for green, <em>chloros</em>, has an etymology which links it to &#8220;young herbage,&#8221; a fresh light green; and if you think of <em>chloros</em> as meaning more &#8220;light&#8221; than &#8220;green,&#8221; then &#8220;green honey&#8221; is really just &#8220;pale, bright honey.&#8221;  By extension, faces &#8220;green with disgust&#8221; may actually be &#8220;pale with disgust.&#8221;<br /><br />AND THAT&#8217;S WHY I WROTE THIS POST.  BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT OUR COMMONLY USED TERM, &#8220;[WHATEVER]&#8217;S FACE TURNED GREEN,&#8221; DOES NOT ACTUALLY MEAN THAT IT TURNED GREEN, BUT HAS A CONNECTION TO THE ANCIENT LACK OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE COLOR GREEN AND PALENESS <span class="shh">(maybe)</span>.<br /><br />As for &#8220;the ancient lack of blue&#8221; &#8211; I guess Goldstone&#8217;s theory is that humanity only grew to have a vivid appreciation of color when color started to matter, i.e. when artificial dyes started to become easy to come by.  Ancient Greek (and ancient Indian languages, despite their praising of T3h Heavens) lack a word for &#8220;blue.&#8221;<br /><br />And I guess perceptions of color are even changing <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/4013694698/datchan-on-the-issues-the-changing-standards-of">in more recent times</a>.<br /><br />Anyway, faces green/pale with disgust.  That&#8217;s all.</div>

I feel like I can see new stories rising at every line and edge.<br /><br />For our introductory game using the <a href="http://heartrategames.com/">HeartRate Games</a> API that I helped to create, we&#8217;re building a really simple game involving bunnies and monsters (both arbitrarily chosen during brainstorming), where bunnies are things to be chased and monsters are things to be crushed at high velocity.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4WL8NEf6E0E/TaulAVabpXI/AAAAAAAAAL8/kSWXBjWDzw4/s1600/DSC_0375.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4WL8NEf6E0E/TaulAVabpXI/AAAAAAAAAL8/kSWXBjWDzw4/s640/DSC_0375.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><br />To learn Unity in the first place, Mari and I read through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unity-Game-Development-Essentials-Goldstone/dp/184719818X">Unity Game Development Essentials</a>, which was a pretty good primer, though it&#8217;s hard for me to remember some of the tutorials now that I&#8217;m trying to work through things on my own.  I think that&#8217;s more a fault of the fact that I&#8217;ve never done game development, really, much less much manipulation of 3d objects.  In our Computer Graphics class it was all C++, compile, see if your shadows rendered properly, change stuff, compile again.<br /><br />Anyway, the basics I know of Unity should be enough to implement a basic skeleton of a game, more as a proof of concept than anything polished and pretty.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aZRyFlgj0ek/TaukuK2N3mI/AAAAAAAAAL0/wYT4Lr-cZjI/s1600/DSC_0377.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aZRyFlgj0ek/TaukuK2N3mI/AAAAAAAAAL0/wYT4Lr-cZjI/s640/DSC_0377.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dat skeleton</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It&#8217;s a shame that we won&#8217;t be able to do something uber-fancy, but there&#8217;s definitely not enough time in eight weeks, amidst my other classes, to do anything else. D: In particular we were brainstorming various challenges to an exercise game, and came up with some &#8211;<br /><br /><ul><li>How do you make an exercise game engaging all the way through, so people don&#8217;t get bored in the middle?</li><li>How can you make sure people can rest when they&#8217;re tired and not get too penalized?</li><li>How can you even force people to rest during long stretches of exercise?</li><li>When people go up to a stationary bike at the gym, they may just be concerned with exercising for a period of time; so how do you time a game and make sure that people can finish a round in 20 minutes or 30 minutes, and feel satisfied?</li></ul><br />Thus, bunnies and monsters. &nbsp;Our bunnies are the main incentive &#8211; they speed up when players need to speed up &#8211; and monsters to be defeated can have constraints on their vanquishing, which in turn puts constrains on a user&#8217;s action. &nbsp;One monster could require speeding up very fast momentarily to flatten it; another maybe could be unbeatable, and thus can only be dealt with by sneaking past it, slowly, or at a constant heart rate.<br /><br />We were also exploring different ways that we could use a game to guide people through proper warming up, then exercise, then cooling down, through different stages of a level.  What I mostly want to do is make it so that an exercise game is capable of educating people about exercise, which is something I feel I never really received properly; for example, you&#8217;re told in your P.E. class that it&#8217;s good to warm up and cool down, but why, exactly?  What&#8217;s the difference between diastolic and systolic blood pressure?  What&#8217;s their proper ranges, and what does it mean if their numbers are too high or too low?<br /><br />Nowadays you could just Google this information, but learning it in the context of exercising would be more fun, I think.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So a couple of days ago I attended <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/technologybrierdudleysblog/2014767469_zynga_launches_seattleville_be.html">the launch of Zynga&#8217;s Seattle office</a>.  It was pretty delicious; I guess Zynga has their own pomegranate martini with Pop Rocks in it.  They sank to the bottom though and become saturated with t3h alcohols pretty quickly.  My other favorite food was this sort of fried wonton with the most melty sashimi in it, which came with a sort of guacamole-with-edamame substance.  Also present: hand-made marshmallows dipped in chocolate and covered in nuts and thinly sliced almonds.<br /><br />I went with David and Fransiskus and we all managed to get pictures with Mark Pincus XD<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X94S1A0OyYk/TaoFcg39kjI/AAAAAAAAALM/2cX_OsjL8G4/s1600/photo.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X94S1A0OyYk/TaoFcg39kjI/AAAAAAAAALM/2cX_OsjL8G4/s320/photo.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">and then he went off to mingle elsewhere</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then we chatted with some of the other engineers at the event, who all seemed to be peripheral to games in some way &#8211; I even saw the guy who gave the original concept for <a href="http://heartrategames.com/">one of my research projects</a>.  Mostly I was pretty hyped to get Zynga-world money, which we did end up getting at the very end in a gift bag, along with a nifty thermos.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NzqAbYNCcdM/TaoHnkqJOxI/AAAAAAAAALU/F2A-SnJaRrA/s1600/DSC_0390.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NzqAbYNCcdM/TaoHnkqJOxI/AAAAAAAAALU/F2A-SnJaRrA/s320/DSC_0390.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">swag, yeeee</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then, because David and Fransiskus like it so much, I started playing CityVille.  Which has actually turned out to be really fun o___o I&#8217;ve already been playing <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/02/okay-dude-so-planting-nachos-is.html">FarmVille</a> for a while, and I started FrontierVille because of hearing the Civilization designer created it, but CityVille strikes a perfect balance in between them.  I like the clean artwork and the little people that wave at you and the general friendliness of the whole thing.  The sound effects for when you pick up different resources are also really happy-inducing somehow.  For seriose.  They&#8217;re on par with Zelda SFX for uncovering mystery doors and opening treasure chests.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n_pMrKX-Dxk/TaoIAi5v67I/AAAAAAAAALc/yb0iVhSjdU8/s1600/cityville.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="249" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n_pMrKX-Dxk/TaoIAi5v67I/AAAAAAAAALc/yb0iVhSjdU8/s320/cityville.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so many things to click and feel productive with &lt;3</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Though, I guess a Zynga game is also much more fun definitively if you have a ton of people to play it with, unlike in FrontierVille, where I desperately keep posting requests for Juicy Berries and Critter Milk and have been getting no response.  There have been shy and sick baby creatures on my homestead for months.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-owd_CkgAro4/TaoJ4CfgVII/AAAAAAAAALk/sx-86Dv4v3M/s1600/frontierville.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="257" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-owd_CkgAro4/TaoJ4CfgVII/AAAAAAAAALk/sx-86Dv4v3M/s320/frontierville.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">none of you are ever getting help. &nbsp;ever</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I definitely want to incorporate the &#8220;popping out of things&#8221; like coins and XP in Get Across too, maybe so that when you move onto a tile or something you get rewarded with little coins and bits.  I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s too much of a &#8220;casual&#8221; mechanic that will end up turning people off, though&#8230;I guess for now we&#8217;ll put it off into an advanced feature.</div>

So <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/operating%20systems">OS</a> ended, and the world didn&#8217;t, and I&#8217;m taking the games capstone this quarter.  I&#8217;ve wanted to take this class for forever, and finally&#8230;!<br /><br />But all the initial excitement was broken by the professor&#8217;s declaration on the very first day.  &#8220;The requirement this quarter is that you all have to make social games.&#8221;<br /><br />A sudden discomfort in the room.  Social games?  <em>Really?</em><br /><br />We brainstormed hastily, still in shock, and during discussion exchanged mutters.  &#8220;I really wanted to make a <em>real</em> game this quarter.&#8221;<br /><br />Hard to think otherwise then <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/03/the-social-games-rant-you-didnt-hear-from-gdc/">people tend to feel so visceral about social games.</a> <span class="shh">(That link is there more for the comments than the actual article.)</span>  Around the time the Zynga/Hidden Agenda competition started, I started playing FarmVille for t3h research, and I&#8217;ve continued playing it, alongside FrontierVille, though I like the original FV much better &#8211; it lags on my computer less, and I have more Friends who play it, which makes it slightly easier to obtain gifts and stuff.  Plus I guess I&#8217;m more into the whole pastoral ideal thing than <strike>manifest destiny</strike> the wild wild west.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been trying desperately to work out why people hate social games so much and made the mistake of asking my Facebook network about it.  Given the fact that the intersection of Friends who are a) on the Internets and b) video game savvy are also c) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I7xHg7kmr0">intense about Smash</a>, I generally received snark and pointers to <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33059/Braids_Blow_Social_Games_Are_Not_Very_Social.php">interviews with Jonathan Blow</a>.<br /><br />But, anyway.  I guess the point is that I&#8217;ve been going over it back and forth without much conclusion.   To me, boiled down to their barest bones, FarmVille and WoW (more accepted in that group) are not so much different.  The mechanics encourage you to stick around in exchange for endorphins and the illusion (?) of productivity.  Click something, get something.  Millions of people just float happily in this broth every day.  Why get angry about it?<br /><br />That being said, I was (not completely) swayed to drop the class at the mention of ~*Social Games*~ like a couple other people were, though it would be a lie to say that I wasn&#8217;t disappointed at all.  It&#8217;s hard to think of new social games when things like Zynga and Bejeweled Blitz occupy so much of social game mindshare.  But I wracked my brain and when Andreas started talking about a cardgame called Heartbreak (the rules of which I cannot find online right now, as he described them to me) I decided to apply this to a board game and BAM.  GAME IDEA.<br /><br />PRESENTED IMPROMPTU IN FRONT OF THE CLASS THE NEXT DAY.<br /><br />EARNING NO INTERESTED CLASSMATES INITIALLY.<br /><br />THEN, TWO!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fs5lsvP0CnE/TZ6x_hiv1SI/AAAAAAAAAK8/IWF2FBnShA0/s1600/getacross.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="241" width="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fs5lsvP0CnE/TZ6x_hiv1SI/AAAAAAAAAK8/IWF2FBnShA0/s320/getacross.jpg" /></a></div><br />We&#8217;ve worked it out a little more and did the presentation pitch and I think we&#8217;re actually off to a good start.  My half-hearted, half-hated social game idea is now something that I&#8217;m pretty excited about!  It&#8217;s called <strong>Get Across</strong>.  The objective of the game is to get across a board, or &#8220;terrain,&#8221; comprising obstacles such as mountains, monsters, bodies of water.  You can specialize in three classes, and &#8220;leveling up&#8221; grants you more ability cards.  It&#8217;s essentially a collaborative online board game.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t want to get my hopes too high, but it will be a success if I can have my Smash- and HoN-playing friends to play this game and enjoy it, play it and have that sort of heart-racing, &#8220;We&#8217;re working together and beating everything!&#8221; feeling at least once. :x</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I went to Portland last weekend with Andreas and we visited the <a href="http://japanesegarden.com/">Japanese garden</a>. (I&#8217;m still shocked that out of all the Japanese gardens in the world, even the ones in Japan, it&#8217;s the one in <em>Portland</em> that is japanesegarden.com.)<br /><br />It was quite beautiful.  I had the impression when I entered that it was much larger than Seattle&#8217;s Japanese garden, but now I&#8217;m not quite sure.  Seattle has a wide impressive lake while Portland has waterfalls, and since it&#8217;s set up at a fairly high altitude, rather than set between the roads crossing through the Arboretum, Portland reminded me more of the gardens that I visited with Derek in Kyoto, especially seeing the high, green, looming cliffs.  Also, just like at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiyomizudera">Kiyomizudera</a>, there&#8217;s a good view of Portland sprawling out.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/4991486476/in/set-72157624660642459/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LQ5jvg-t7Po/TYv2ZG6FhRI/AAAAAAAAAJs/QKcdwpl-SmU/s320/4991486476_7b85d75ba5_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is the view from Kiyomizudera; I don&#8217;t have one from Portland since for some reason for this whole trip I wasn&#8217;t inspired to take many pictures :/</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was talking with Heatherchan later, who mentioned that the garden was kind of &#8220;underwhelming,&#8221; and I think when I was there I felt that way too.  <em>We climbed this entire mountain for nothing?</em>  I think on the whole it&#8217;s because Japanese gardens contain a ton of moss.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/5556088909/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-47108ROc8ao/TYv8dUzdfKI/AAAAAAAAAKc/M8qLk2uWelM/s320/5556088909_170fd3e033_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">moss-covered branches</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/5556090059/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Yo2Jlhd0cvc/TYv8drHonUI/AAAAAAAAAKk/Fi80tmuNSPI/s320/5556090059_70224e922f_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">mossy tufts</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/5556706640/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DC2L7qDUj0E/TYv8dyUHY3I/AAAAAAAAAKs/FFfuCHrLbiQ/s320/5556706640_fa52e48c34_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">mossy rocks</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/5556678042/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l0bK0ytcsrE/TYv8d0AJ-5I/AAAAAAAAAK0/8VKBGiE7lYE/s320/5556678042_b68d623a32_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">just, mossy mcmosserson, everywhere</td></tr></tbody></table><br />When people think of gardens, I&#8217;m sure that they think of gardens erupting in splendor, maybe &#8211; as Andreas would put it &#8211; roses and shit everywhere, heavy floral scents, bees.  Grass, at the very least.  In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chado">chado</a> class I took autumn quarter, we spent some time learning about Japanese gardens in relation to tea ceremony and how extraordinary features like beautiful flowers in a path can detract from the solemnity and concentration needed in a ceremony.  Instead of thinking about your guests or your host, about how this moment you&#8217;re spending with them can never be repeated ever again in the history of the universe, you&#8217;re thinking, <em>God, look at these roses and shit.</em><br /><br />I imagine that this attitude influences Japanese gardens a lot; that is, if I&#8217;m underwhelmed by a Japanese garden, it&#8217;s probably doing its duty in giving me an opportunity to meditate on my life and my choices so that they&#8217;ll resonate like stones dropped into a still pool.<br /><br /><span class="shh">etc. etc.</span><br /><br />A lot of Portland Japanese Garden was under construction, too, so I can imagine that if it lacked a little majesty, it will probably acquire it later.<br /><br />There was a stone garden by a Japanese-style house that was under construction, and since we climbed for forever to reach the garden, Andreas and I sat down and I proceeded to take tons of pictures, with the (vague) intent to create a panorama.  Andreas insisted that I stitch it together by hand, but since programs are written to save time and because they want to be used, I just Googled panorama stitching and downloaded the first program I found, called <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a>.<br /><br />It&#8217;s pretty easy to use.  You just dump all your pictures in there, put in your camera data (if it&#8217;s already not interpreted for you), and then say, &#8220;Go, program!  Align!&#8221;<br /><br />Disclaimer: I read no instructions and knew absolutely nothing about this software or panorama-stitching softwares at all, so I was just kind of experimenting and seeing what would happen.  At some point the program said that it couldn&#8217;t find coordinations between two groups of photos, and asked for control points, which I kind of assumed (with my quarter&#8217;s knowledge of computer vision) that it wanted me to tell it what points in two different pictures corresponded to the same object in both.  This was easy and kind of fun to do.<br /><br />This was my first result:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qnc33xmH_eA/TYv4BOKTpBI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/9hnNzARl47s/s1600/portlandjg_pano_orig.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="209" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qnc33xmH_eA/TYv4BOKTpBI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/9hnNzARl47s/s320/portlandjg_pano_orig.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh my goodness why what happened</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was kind of disappointed because I thought that everything would just look perfect off the bat (.___. The weird mossy spot to the right was obviously wrong, and there are rocks off to the right that are weird too.<br /><br />But then I thought, <em>Wait.  What if I add more control points?</em><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AF5eEECpYwg/TYv4iRS2_-I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/0buYTC_U5cg/s1600/portlandjg_pano_v2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="175" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AF5eEECpYwg/TYv4iRS2_-I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/0buYTC_U5cg/s320/portlandjg_pano_v2.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">what! &nbsp;it kind of worked!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It is super fun to add more control points.  I also like how the program shows you the strength of the match in the control points between two different pictures.<br /><br />There was still the obvious mess of the railing below though, probably because it lacks features, to the extent that it&#8217;s kind of difficult for even me to make control points. :/<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2qcePuU2W0s/TYv5IsK4f9I/AAAAAAAAAKE/dUBMC-Dzfu4/s1600/portlandjg_pano_v3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="237" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2qcePuU2W0s/TYv5IsK4f9I/AAAAAAAAAKE/dUBMC-Dzfu4/s320/portlandjg_pano_v3.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">we&#8217;re getting there, though</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And, finally:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n8xPQhr3pGE/TYv53-ygKbI/AAAAAAAAAKM/6PFi9yF-5uE/s1600/portlandjg_pano.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="351" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n8xPQhr3pGE/TYv53-ygKbI/AAAAAAAAAKM/6PFi9yF-5uE/s400/portlandjg_pano.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">still a couple weird spots, but good for a first try when i don&#8217;t really know what i&#8217;m doing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Mental notes for making panoramas in the future:<br /><ul><li>Don&#8217;t give up after the program&#8217;s first attempt at stitching; find places that are weirded out and add more control points around that region.</li><li>If something is fairly long and texturally featureless (i.e. a pole) maybe try placing a hand on it or some other marking, to give the program an easier time at aligning.</li><li>Make sure to get pictures at the border of the wanted panorama!  I ended up with a lot of holes which prevented me from getting a good rectangle 3:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xjqqVBKW1y0/TYv6GMDroOI/AAAAAAAAAKU/SqPSKeiB8WY/s1600/panoooooooorama.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="226" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xjqqVBKW1y0/TYv6GMDroOI/AAAAAAAAAKU/SqPSKeiB8WY/s320/panoooooooorama.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">YOU RUINED EVERYTHING</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li>I should probably also try standing up and walking around next time when taking pictures to avoid the fisheye effect;; Not that it&#8217;s entirely ugly.</li></ul></div>
