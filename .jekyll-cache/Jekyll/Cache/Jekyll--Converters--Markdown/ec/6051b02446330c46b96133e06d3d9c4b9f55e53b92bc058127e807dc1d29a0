I"g<p>I have my first publication out in <a href="https://solarpunkmagazine.com">Solarpunk Magazine</a>!</p>

<p>It was written for their May 2022 Microfiction Contest, which was themed “Solarpunk in Asia and the Pacific Islands.” I wrote it fresh off finishing Alex G. Pacman’s <em>Filipino Ghost Stories</em>, and wanted to mix ghost stories with the solarpunk aesthetic (as well as a healthy dose of diaspora mango angst).</p>
