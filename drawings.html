<h4 class="ls1">I draw!</h4>

  I post on <a href="http://instagram.com/miryenda">my Instagram</a>. I designed the 2020 “Year of the Rat” mascot for the Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience. I also design stickers.

  For a couple years I've been unreasonably into <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/">Hobonichi Techo Planners</a>. I used to have three of them. (Three planners.) I have since learned from my past tragedies and have accepted that two planners is about my limit. (Two.)
