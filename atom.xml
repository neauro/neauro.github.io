    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was investigating different Javascript libraries for blurring things on mobile. In this case, blurring would act to obscure an image from the user.</p>

<h3><a href="http://blurjs.com/?bg=1">Blur.js</a></h3>


<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s easy; plug and play. It also supports draggable elements (<a href="http://blurjs.com/simpledemo.html">and has a neat demo proving it</a>)</li>
<li>You can specify your overlay color and blur radius, and it even supports caching.</li>
<li>More hackproof; since (on first glance) it seems to replace your original image entirely, you can&#8217;t easily unblur it using developer tools.</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>When I used this library for a div with a background-image, the entire image wasn&#8217;t blurred out; only part of it. It didn&#8217;t play nicely with my background-image having a <code>background-size:cover</code> style.</li>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t seem to work for blurring text or colored divs; just elements with some image aspect.</li>
<li>You need to provide a &#8220;source&#8221; of blurring for some reason.</li>
</ul>




<h3><a href="http://nbartlomiej.github.io/foggy/">Foggy</a></h3>


<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses the CSS &#8220;filter&#8221; and falls back to a &#8220;manual blur&#8221; if the browser doesn&#8217;t support it.</li>
<li><em>Really</em> simple; at the most basic level, all you need is <code>$(".selector").foggy()</code></li>
<li>It worked on mobile Safari! (And I haven&#8217;t yet tested it with anything else.)</li>
<li>You can also unblur blurred objects!</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The manual blur creates duplicates of elements, so it could be pretty expensive? Especially for a mobile web app, my specific use case. (In my brief tests, I didn&#8217;t notice any particular behavior downgrade.)</li>
<li>You could &#8220;hack&#8221; this by inspecting elements to see what the original image is.</li>
</ul>


<p>I ended up using Foggy so that I could grab multiple elements with one selector to blur (rather than needing to iterate through each and supply each one with its own &ldquo;source&rdquo;). Also, &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; via a developer tool is less of a risk. and, honestly, it just worked more quickly, though I do love the layout of Blur&rsquo;s page better.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Manga: Noragami | ノラガミ, ADACHI Toka]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/25/noragami-rec/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-25T11:16:27-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/25/noragami-rec</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/animango/noragami.jpg" alt="Cover of volume 10 of Noragami, showing its three main protagonists"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14290364-champion">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>At the boundary between this realm and another, there live eight million gods, dead spirits who serve the gods, and other assorted spirits who help and meddle in the affairs of humans. A sweet middle school girl named Mutsumi has been enduring bullying from her classmates, and she goes to the restroom by herself to cry. Scrawled on the bathroom wall is a phone number and the message, &#8220;I will solve your troubles.&#8221;
<br/><br/>

After Mutsumi calls the number, she encounters a homeless, unemployed figure who proclaims himself a &#8220;god.&#8221; Crude, unpredictable, and worthless, he does not answer people&#8217;s prayers and no one acknowledges him. However, he has one sole power, the ability to cut all who pass between this world and the next. (<a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=56588">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>The previous manga description is strange because the character &ldquo;Mutsumi&rdquo; only appears in the first chapter&hellip;but, eh.</p>

<p>Noragami, the first story both written and illustrated by the ADACHI Toka team, <em>is my new favorite manga</em>.</p>

<p>The basic elements of the story are Shinto-style gods; their &ldquo;shinki,&rdquo; who are spirits of deceased humans who can take on the form of weaponry/animals/etc.; and &ldquo;ayakashi,&rdquo; or phantoms, the Bad Animal Things that exist invisibly in the world of humans. The main protagonists are Yato, a &ldquo;stray god&rdquo; without a shrine; Hiyori, a high school girl who, due to a car accident, is a &ldquo;half-ayakashi&rdquo; capable of astral projection; and Yukine, Yato&rsquo;s shinki, who can take the form of a sword. The story starts with Yato&rsquo;s desire to obtain a shrine for his own and delves into the ideas of what it means to trust humans and what it means to live to obtain (or be the source of) happiness.</p>

<p>[mild spoilers ahead]</p>

<p>Reasons why you should read it:</p>

<ul>
<li>The character development is incredible. Even characters like Yukine, who seemed poised to be ultra-generic gruff teenage shounen, grows into a kind of character I rarely see amongst teenage boys: both jealous and compassionate when it comes to people he cares about, easily hurt and full of pride and determination.</li>
<li>Though it starts with a lot of characters explaining painfully exact and detailed world-building to each other, the story continues on to fleshes out every aspect and angle of what you&#8217;re told about. We start with a single god having a single shinki (Yato and Yukine), and then explore what it means for a god to have multiple shinki (as in the case of Vaisravana and her family), and what it means for a shinki to have multiple gods (as in the case of &#8220;Nora&#8221;). Each of these aspects come with examinations of the emotions and motivations of all the characters involved. <em>Ahhh it&#8217;s so good</em></li>
<li>After the first big infodump, the story also introduces &#8220;new ideas&#8221; very smoothly. When the idea of &#8220;what happens when a god dies&#8221; is brought in, it continues to be picked up and played with by later events. <em>Which is so fantastic.</em></li>
<li>The art is beautiful! It has more of a &#8220;realistic&#8221; feel, like <em>Death Note</em>, and the characters are visually varied. <em>The characters are actually varied.</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hiyori isn&#8217;t terribly interesting yet; she&#8217;s struggled with wanting to maintain her relationship with Yato, but otherwise doesn&#8217;t seem to have any personal problems to overcome, which is unfortunate. Whereas Yato and Yukine both have had their share of personal obstacles, Hiyori seems to be taking a &#8220;Fruits Basket Tohru-like&#8221; role in being &#8220;the one that supports everyone (almost) unconditionally.&#8221; Still, she does call out other characters on their toxic behavior, takes none of that behavior herself, and has cool heroic moments where she saves both Yato and Yukine from their various problems (and <em>not</em> just by encouraging them to talk it out or merely offering phrases like &#8220;I believe in you!&#8221;&#8230;though those happen too).</li>
<li>Still, I have a lot of faith in this manga and I&#8217;m looking forward to Hiyori getting more development in the future.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/25/kaze-tachinu/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/kaze_tachinu_poster.jpg" alt="Poster for The Wind Rises, showing a woman painting"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises">via</a>)</p>




<blockquote>Jirou dreams of flying and designing beautiful airplanes, inspired by the famous Italian aeronautical designer Caproni. Nearsighted from a young age and thus unable to become a pilot, Jirou joins the aircraft division of a major Japanese engineering company in 1927. His genius is soon recognized, and he grows to become one of the world&#8217;s most accomplished airplane designers.</br><br/>
Key historical events deeply affected the course of Jirou&#8217;s life, including the great Kanto earthquake of 1923, the Great Depression, the tuberculosis epidemic, and Japan&#8217;s plunge into war. He meets and falls in love with Naoko, grows and cherishes his friendship with his colleague Honjou, and innovates tremendously, leading the aviation world into the future. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>I saw The Wind Rises last weekend, dubbed. It was one of the few times in recent memory that I actually paid for popcorn and even a coke slushie at a theater. <em>The latter itself was $6.50. Jeez.</em></p>

<p>[ mild spoilers ahead ]</p>

<p>Reasons why you should see it:</p>

<ul>
<li>The animation is gorgeous.</li>
<li><em>Really gorgeous.</em></li>
<li>The dreamy, vague nature of time and places keeps you on your toes. I found it fun to put the fluid pieces of the movie together.</li>
<li>I loved watching the way different characters interacted with each other. For example, Jiro and Honjo never say to each other, &#8220;You are my best friend,&#8221; but they take pains to eat together, help each other, and get assigned to the same projects. Honjo never says &#8220;I need to take care of your air-headed sorry ass all the time;&#8221; but he rolls his eyes at Jiro only ever eating spongecake, and when Jiro is assigned separately from him to travel the world, he says, &#8221;<em>Alone</em>?&#8221; with a certain anxiety that I appreciate for its show-don&#8217;t-tell-ness.</li>
</ul>


<p>[ less mild spoilers ahead ]</p>

<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some of the dubbed lines have jarringly awkward wording.</li>
<li>The movie walks through significant Japanese historical events and ideals, which can be totally lost on you if you have no idea what they are.</li>
<li>None of the characters develop. All of them begin with certain motivations at the beginning of the story, and end having those same motivations. There&#8217;s no real struggle; even moments I thought were somewhat stressful (Jiro&#8217;s planes constantly failing and falling in a blaze; Jiro being hunted by the secret police) were never played up, and therefore never felt meaningful. So why have them?</li>
<li>There&#8217;s not too much of a unifying theme, which is ultimately fine, though nowadays &#8220;unifying themes&#8221; and their skews and slants are what get me really hyperventilating about certain media.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/23/smallworld/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-23T09:37:48-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/23/smallworld</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/smallworld1.jpg" alt="Picture of Smallworld board, with 'Dragon Master Elves' at the front"/></p>

<p class="caption">dragon master elves?!</p>


<p>Last Friday we hit up a small pub table and inconspicuously played J&rsquo;s copy of Small World, <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/">&ldquo;the fun, zany, light-hearted civilization board game!&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote>Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci™, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs and even humans; who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth. (<a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>This game has some disturbing colonialization themes aside; there are even pre-existing people in some territorites that you must conquer to inhabit that territory. Even so, I enjoyed this game so much that I eyed it hungrily at Card Kingdom after our party dispersed. The delicious flavor! The cool (albeit almost entirely white) characters! I love that the game naturally becomes different each time as you mix &ldquo;race powers&rdquo; and &ldquo;special powers;&rdquo; I love that the flavor of the game itself, its pictures and words, are delicious and meaningful and fly off the cardboard and became us — as in the terrifying era of K&rsquo;s Pillaging Skeletons, uprooting their femurs from mountain and farmland and laying waste across nests of Flying Trolls and Berserk Humans, resting for only a moment before rising again in greater number. <em>What</em>.</p>

<p>One weak part of the game, however, are the victory points. They are called gold; if you have the most of them at the end of the game, You Win. Flavor-wise, I don&rsquo;t feel like they entirely fit — when, during all this conquest, does gold arbitrary rise from the depths? — and there&rsquo;s also not much that you can do with them, other than occasionally exchange them to get the race you want. During the &ldquo;conquest&rdquo; phase, they are useless. What if instead you could use them to do something like increase your number of troops, and gamble to try and get more land? What if you needed to pay coins in order to roll for reinforcement, an action that is otherwise totally free and something you usually want to do? It seems like a missed opportunity for <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2010/03/flydrill-and-logistical-gameplay.html">logistical gameplay</a>, and allowing players the pleasure of &ldquo;not simply doing something, but doing it well — optimizing it to perfection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A also noted that, though he felt he had made the right &ldquo;decisions,&rdquo; he still placed last in our group of four, and didn&rsquo;t grasp how he could have played the game better. He didn&rsquo;t feel that he had &ldquo;gained experience&rdquo; and learned how to play the game any better. Though I can&rsquo;t find it now, it reminds me of what I have read once regarding <a href="http://spryfox.com/our-games/tripletown/">Triple Town</a>, and how it seems to be a simple game until you make a mistake — <em>and then you get it</em>, you get what the game is about, you feel excited to give it another go.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/smallworld2.jpg" alt="Picture of Smallworld board, with a ton of stuff on it"/></p>

<p class="caption">smallworld board, getting all exciting as stuff accumulates</p>


<p>I hope to try out the expansions sometime, though the use of &ldquo;gypsy&rdquo; as a race in one of them is disconcerting, and reminds me of how uncomfortable the overall theme is.</p>

    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/23/convey-ux-notes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/convey1.jpg" alt="First pages of my notes from ConveyUX"/></p>

<p class="caption">first page of my notes from ConveyUX. all pages in their full nearly-illegible glory at <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/post/77602386103/finally-got-around-to-summarizing-all-the-notes-i">at my tumblr</a></p>


<p>This past week I attended <a href="http://www.conveyux.com/">ConveyUX</a>, a now two-year-old UX conference presented by <a href="http://www.blinkux.com/">Blink</a>. I also attended last year, and was impressed by the growth that this conference has had since then. There were over twice the number of attendees, and everyone was incredibly friendly. Don Norman was the keynote speaker and I got him to sign my copy of <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>!</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/doet.jpg" alt="The inside cover of Design of Everyday Things, and signature of its author, Don Norman"/></p>

<p class="caption">yess!</p>


<p>I took a lot of notes — not so much to help me remember stuff later (though notes are helpful for that purpose), but because it helps keep my mind from wandering, and helps ideas stick more tightly.</p>

<p>The following are some of the interesting ideas I came away with from the talks I attended.</p>

<h2>Day 1 Talks</h2>


<h3>Keynote, Don Norman</h3>


<ul>
<li>UX is not about websites, it&#8217;s about life.</li>
<li>Putting a picture of a button on a screen does not &#8220;afford&#8221; touching; it &#8220;signifies&#8221; that the user should touch</li>
<li>Designers pride themselves on answering the right question, and not on solving the exact problem they&#8217;re trying to solve</li>
<li>(Don) Norman&#8217;s Law: the day the product team is assembled, it&#8217;s over budget and behind schedule. (lolz)</li>
<li>The most powerful questions are stupid: question fundamentals and change the world</li>
<li>For people struggling with managers, remember: who are your users? It&#8217;s not the customers. It&#8217;s the people who are using you, your employers</li>
<li>&#8220;Marketing was absolutely right to put a button on the radio that was labeled &#8216;better sound,&#8217; because otherwise people wouldn&#8217;t know it was there.&#8221;</li>
</ul>




<h3>Beyond Usable: Mapping Emotion to Experience, Kelly Goto</h3>


<ul>
<li><em>youyuu</em>: a Japanese idea related to &#8220;enjoying the time that you have between events;&#8221; for this, you arrive early and cherish the extra time you have</li>
<li>&#8220;All our fields are moving so fast that we have no <em>youyuu</em></li>
<li>It&#8217;s powerful to be present</li>
<li>Kano surveys: you&#8217;re not impressed by a cup that doesn&#8217;t leak, but &#8220;not leaking&#8221; is necessary to function</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansei_engineering">Kansei engineering</a>: aims the development or improvement of products and services by translating customer&#8217;s psychological feelings and needs into product design</li>
<li>Keep drilling down into user&#8217;s experiences. Why why why do they enjoy something? What are the &#8220;kansei&#8221; words?</li>
<li><a href="https://dscout.com/">Dscout</a>: see what people are doing on a daily basis</li>
<li>Kaizen: continuous improvement — everyday — with everyone — everywhere.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Right Experience, Right People, Phillip Hunter</h3>


<ul>
<li>&#8220;Have you ever been to a restaurant that was just fine, but you&#8217;d never go back?&#8221;</li>
<li>UX for &#8220;real people&#8221; is going to the dentist</li>
<li>Google &#8220;mad at my phone&#8221; — there are millions of hits</li>
<li>&#8220;Experiential equalities must be distinguished from properties of objects&#8221; — C. I. Lewis</li>
<li>Qualia: intangible things that make up our experience. ex. our responses to color, taste, pain</li>
<li>There are no &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; words to describe experiences; for example, video games are &#8220;hard to use,&#8221; but this is makes them great games</li>
</ul>




<h3>Beyond Gamification, Catt Small</h3>


<ul>
<li>The field is constantly expanding because people are coming in and bringing their previous fields with them</li>
<li>Since 2011, more smartphones have sold than computers</li>
<li>Game players and game makers connect to each other with easter eggs</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/#q=zerg+rush">Zerg Rush!</a></li>
<li>Capitalize on emotions for memorability</li>
</ul>




<h3>Designing for Engagement, Susan Weinschenk</h3>


<ul>
<li>People do as little as possible</li>
<li>People have a maximum of 20 minutes of thinking time</li>
<li>Most mental processing is unconscious — ex. you know what a penny looks like, but wouldn&#8217;t usually know how to draw one from memory.</li>
<li>People can only deal with remembering 3 or 4 things (not 7).</li>
<li>More people stopped to see jam when there were 24 jars; but more people BOUGHT jars when there were only 6 displayed.</li>
<li>People are more motivated by fear of loss than anticipation of gain.</li>
<li>People expect technology to follow human-to-human interaction rules. Thus don&#8217;t use phrases like &#8220;book a copy of the book from the full bib page.&#8221;</li>
</ul>




<h3>How to Get People to Do Stuff, Susan Weinschenk</h3>


<ul>
<li>People&#8217;s &#8220;self stories&#8221; govern who they think they are and what they do; so if you want to get them to do something, change those self stories. On that note, words like &#8220;Be a Donor&#8221; are more effective than &#8220;Donate now!&#8221;</li>
<li>You can tell when someone is doing &#8220;slow&#8221; thinking — their pupils dilate.</li>
<li>People solve logical problems correctly when the problem is written in a hard-to-read font.</li>
<li>SALE ON SOUP! If &#8220;limit of 10 cans&#8221; on the sign, then people buy 7 cans on average; if &#8220;no limit&#8221; is written, people buy 3.</li>
<li>To get people to build a habit around your product, tie it into someone people already do habitually, like checking e-mail in the morning.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Day 2 Talks</h2>


<h3>Content &amp; Control, Sara Wachter-Boettcher</h3>


<ul>
<li>Content reveals a company&#8217;s values, beliefs, and baggage</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t divide people into &#8220;the website team&#8221; and &#8220;everyone else;&#8221; when you let people into the process and help design style guide rules (and such), they get invested, and will actually follow the rules they&#8217;ve made for themselves, rather than the &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; style and design guides you&#8217;ve imposed on them</li>
</ul>




<h3>What We Can Leaern From Digital Outcasts, Kel Smith</h3>


<ul>
<li>People think &#8220;accessibility isn&#8217;t innovative,&#8221; but what requires more creativity than working underneath extreme constraints? Things like Hummers and Tang have already been created under incredible constraints.</li>
<li>The typewriter was invented for a blind person who could not write</li>
<li>&#8220;The future has arrived, it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed yet.&#8221; — William Gibson</li>
<li>Competence is a spectrum, not a binary.</li>
<li>Empathy allows for you to change &#8220;unchangeable&#8221; attributes</li> 
</ul>




<h3>The Four Most Common Mistakes in Mobile/Web App Designs, Mike Mace</h3>


<ul>
<li>DON&#8217;T make text too small, older folks can&#8217;t read it</li>
<li>DON&#8217;T have low contrast; the sun will wash out words! (For that matter, test your interfaces outside)</li>
<li>DON&#8217;T use sliders; they&#8217;re too hard to adjust when there are too many values.</li>
<li>Respond fast.</li>
<li>Provide help, not tooltips (that people on mobile don&#8217;t discover as easily)</li>
<li>DON&#8217;T have an unintuitive success path.</li>
<li>Mobile is &#8220;short attention span theatre;&#8221; people often forget what they&#8217;re doing or don&#8217;t understand.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Collaging: Getting Answers to the Questions You Didn&#8217;t Know to Ask, Kyle Soucy</h3>


<ul>
<li>Collaging is a &#8220;need evaluation&#8221; technique.</li>
<li>Honestly, collaging is great and <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/06/collaging-getting-answers-questions-you-dont-know-ask/">this article</a> describes it better than I could here.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Agile UX: Embrace or Tolerate? Rob Keefer</h3>


<ul>
<li>People who struggle with agile dev so do because devs take over and do &#8220;cowboy development&#8221;</li>
<li>Agile is developer-centric. There&#8217;s little time for design or testing.</li>
<li>Remind people to value people over features, feedback over opinion, ease of use over ease of development, discovery over documentation (ex. don&#8217;t handhold)</li>
<li>Doing things together is better!</li>
</ul>




<h2>Day 3 Talks</h2>


<h3>Writing Great Persona Stories, Whitney Quesenbery</h3>


<ul>
<li>Stories are important because they help us remember people who are not in the room.</li>
<li>Persona stories help communicate patterns of use</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t include people with disabilities in the beginning, they&#8217;re not going to be included later</li>
<li>You might know your audience, but do you know how to use your knowledge of them?</li>
<li>Make sure your stories are connecting people emotionally to your work. It&#8217;s the individual story that gets you to donate and work for someone, not the numbers of people that need help.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t tell stories of how your users are dumb, but of how they accomplish things</li>
</ul>




<h3>Tools for Mobile UX Design, Steven Hoober</h3>


<ul>
<li>To design for mobile:
<ol>
<li>DON&#8217;T draw (until you understand your solution). Otherwise, you&#8217;re going to lock yourself into interactions and events that might not even answer the problem.</li>
<li>Ecosystems first. Figure out your user flows and platforms.</li>
<li>Experience mobile daily. If you&#8217;re going to design for a Blackberry, get one.</li>
<li>Work at scale. (ex. don&#8217;t work on mockups that aren&#8217;t at phone size)</li>
<li>Annotate, describe, understand.</li>
<li>Evaluate (early, as much as you can, before release).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Define your design. What are the goals and objectives of your users and organization? What are users doing now to solve the problem you are trying to help them with?</li>
<li>If you structure your processes correctly, they will be collaborative.</li>
<li><a href="http://getlaunch.com">LAUNCH</a>: mobile prototyping</li>
<li>Describing is more powerful than prototyping. Specying with words encourages people to design more lightweight-ly. ex. &#8220;use default icons&#8221; instead of finding logos to display at the right size and color for your prototype</li>
<li>Evaluate: Does your information architecture make sense? Are there errors? Is there a &#8220;happy path&#8221;? ARE YOU LYING?</li>
</ul>




<h3>Anticipatory Services &amp; Ambient Personalisation, Oli Shaw</h3>


<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s our relationship to the invisible services that power our work?</li>
<li>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on in that black box, but install it and we&#8217;ll give you lower car insurance&#8221; — how can this be expanded?</li>
<li>Uninvited personalisation is becoming more creepy</li>
<li>London trash bins that are tracking wifi-connected smartphones: can tell who you&#8217;re with, where you work, where you&#8217;re at&#8230;.technology is evolving faster than our laws can protect us</li>
<li>It&#8217;s the designer&#8217;s responsibility to push back and protect users</li>
<li>DON&#8217;T patronize, obscure, confuse, dictate</li>
<li>DO use discretion, appropriate, be relevant, and empathize.</li>
<li>Design a relationship, not just an experience.</li>
</ul>




<h3>The World is a Screen, Andrew Hinton</h3>


<ul>
<li>&#8220;All our cognition is embedded&#8230;brains evolved in the service of cognition&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;information is elements in the environment that tells us what the environment affords&#8221;</li>
<li>Perception only exists insofar as we perceive affordances&#8230;&#8221; You don&#8217;t perceive anything unless you understand its structure and how to interact with it.</li>
<li>Before being literate was a thing, buildings were the way we told stories — cathedrals, gargoyles&#8230;</li>
<li>The way we talk and write about our shared environment makes that environment. ex. be careful about assuming things like &#8220;the TV is the second screen&#8221; — this isn&#8217;t true for everyone.</li>
<li>Avocado: an app for couples that lets them send hugs to each other.</li>
<li>Check: are the rules behind the environment clearly expressed in its information?</li>
</ul>




<h3>How People Really Touch and Feel, Steve Hoober</h3>


<ul>
<li>Mobile traffic outnumbers web traffic</li>
<li>&#8220;phablet&#8221; — a phone tablet. omg</li>
<li>People will slow to tap the edges of their phone screen; they are more inaccurate there</li>
<li>Make sure your simple interactions just work before moving on to delightful animation</li>
<li>Be consistent — make hitboxes conventionally large.</li>
<li>A rule of thumb: don&#8217;t pr stuff about the target below the target, ex. with carousels, don&#8217;t put labels beneath the pictures because people&#8217;s thumbs will cover it.</li>
<li>Minimum size of hitbox: 6mm. Preferred size: 8mm.</li>
<li>Watch out for interference! Make a circle 8mm in diameter and center it on your hitbox. If the circle intersects with other items, those items will interfere.</li>
<li>Anything in the edges of the screen or the top and bottom borders should be big.</li>
<li>Design by zones. Put things you want people to use on the center.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/17/champion/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-17T16:06:33-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/17/champion</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/champion.jpg" alt="Cover of Champion, which features a black and red rose"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14290364-champion">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>June and Day have sacrificed so much for the people of the Republic—and each other—and now their country is on the brink of a new existence. June is back in the good graces of the Republic, working within the government’s elite circles as Princeps-Elect, while Day has been assigned a high-level military position. <br/><br/> 
But neither could have predicted the circumstances that will reunite them: just when a peace treaty is imminent, a plague outbreak causes panic in the Colonies, and war threatens the Republic’s border cities. This new strain of plague is deadlier than ever, and June is the only one who knows the key to her country’s defense. But saving the lives of thousands will mean asking the one she loves to give up everything. <br/><br/>
With heart-pounding action and suspense, Marie Lu’s bestselling trilogy draws to a stunning conclusion. (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14290364-champion">Goodreads</a>)</blockquote>


<p>(I&rsquo;ve also written about the previous books in the <em>Legend</em> trilogy, <a href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2012/10/06/legend-marie-lu/"><em>Legend</em></a> and <a href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2013/05/21/prodigy-marie-lu/"><em>Prodigy</em></a>.)</p>

<p>I finally finished Champion on the bus to work and felt all shaky and full of feels. After having been disappointed by the endings of other YA trilogies I&rsquo;ve finished recently, I was nervous about this one; and though there were some strange parts, ultimately this whole story delivered exactly what I wanted, which was: the bittersweet, bright-future fulfillment of a &ldquo;we are enemies from two different worlds&rdquo; power couple romance.</p>

<p>[ spoilers ahead ]</p>

<p>There were a few strange parts. Thomas&#8217; spoken blow-by-blow, feeling-by-feeling recollection of the night he killed Metias felt kind of awkawrd to me; and there was also more &ldquo;hand-holding&rdquo; than I would have liked. As the story goes on Day begins to lose his memory, and when trying to recollect the name of his caretaker, thinks to himself &ldquo;<em>That&rsquo;s weird</em>&rdquo;&hellip;but as readers, we <em>know</em> that it&rsquo;s strange for Day to forget the name of his long-known caretaker. That the book takes time to point it out takes away part of the fun of realizing it for ourselves.</p>

<p>The society of Antarctica, based entirely on a game-like system of points and ranking, is also thrown in as a curiosity of world-building and not examined in relation to existing structures at all. Given that the Republic of America (with its &ldquo;democratic dictatorship&rdquo; feel) and the Colonies of the America (with its &ldquo;capitalistic tyranny&rdquo; feel) are both recognized as having flaws, I thought that Antarctica might also have criticisms; but Antarctica remains unquestioned and accepted as a powerful government whose allyship is desired. There&rsquo;s nothing terribly &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; with this treatment, but I&rsquo;d really like something more — for this strange piece of world-building to fit into an overall theme, for it to contrast with what June and Day see as admirable about their own country. Maybe something like, &ldquo;Sure, in Antarctica people do good so they can get points, but where <em>we</em> live people do good just because they can and want to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyway, it was an enjoyable trilogy and I&rsquo;m looking forward to more from Marie Lu in the future!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/13/millenium-actress/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-13T14:58:55-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/13/millenium-actress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/millenium.jpg" alt="Millenium Actress poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Actress/">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>A movie studio is being torn down. TV interviewer Genya Tachibana has tracked down its most famous star, Chiyoko Fujiwara, who has been a recluse since she left acting some 30 years ago. Tachibana delivers a key to her, and it causes her to reflect on her career; as she&#8217;s telling the story, Tachibana and Kyoji Ida, his long-suffering cameraman are drawn in. The key was given to her as a teenager by a painter and revolutionary that she helped to escape the police. She becomes an actress because it will make it possible to track him down, and she spends the next several decades acting out that search in various genres and eras. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Actress">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>I watched <em>Millenium Actress</em> with A partly on a whim and partly because she started salivating the instant that she came across images of it online and remembered its existence. Reading about it on Wikipedia now, it looks like it&rsquo;s by Satoshi Kon, which would make it the first film of his that I&rsquo;ve seen. It&rsquo;s a beautiful film with all the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichi-go_ichi-e">ichi go ichi e</a>&rdquo; atmospheres that I&rsquo;ve come to notice and love in Japanese stories since studying chadou one winter.</p>

<p>Why you should watch it:</p>

<ul>
<li>The animation is beautiful.</li>
<li>The story itself is crisp and well-written, super focused, with both moments that are hilarious and heart-clenchingly bittersweet.</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul>
<li>The main point of the story is that &#8220;the actress does everything in her life to reunite with the man she met once and fell in love with&#8221; — which isn&#8217;t totally new and interesting on its own.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/10/saaff/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-10T09:24:04-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/10/saaff</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the kindness of R, I was able to attend the final day of the <a href="http://seattleaaff.org/2014/">Seattle Asian-American Film Festival</a>, an event whose existence I was only barely aware of before R invited me.</p>

<p>We had tickets to see two full documentaries and one short experimental film.</p>

<h2><em>One Generation’s Time: The Legacy Of Silme Domingo &amp; Gene Viernes</em> | <em>To Manong Carlos</em></h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/onegenerationstime.jpg" alt="Photographs of Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes, two Filipino-American activists"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://seattleaaff.org/2014/shorts-programs/one-generations-time-the-legacy-of-silme-domingo-gene-viernes-to-manong-carlos/">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>One short experimental film followed by documentary feature, <em>One Generation’s Time: The Legacy of Silme Domingo & Gene Viernes</em>.</blockquote>


<p><em>One Generation&rsquo;s Time</em> is about the work that Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes did to bring equal working conditions the Filipinos employed seasonally at Alaska canneries. In the 1970s, white workers had access to better food and better living situations than Filipinos doing the same work. Furthermore, on days with less work, rather than being allowed to rest, Filipinos were instructed to move empty cans from one side of warehouses just so they were paid for &ldquo;doing something.&rdquo; Silme and Gene were both murdered for their work, and the documentary discusses the political motivations of the murders, and how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos">Marcos dictatorship</a> was involved. The film was directed by Shannon Gee.</p>

<p><em>To Manong Carlos</em> is a short film directed by Adrian Arilla, about his experiences as a Filipino coming to live and call America his home.</p>

<p>Why you should watch these:</p>

<ul><li><em>One Generation&#8217;s Time</em> introduces the complicated situation and political machinations of behind Silme and Gene&#8217;s work well; probably because, as Shannon Gee said in a panel afterward, she herself was entirely new to this story.</li>
<li><em>To Manong Carlos</em> is a beautiful film where Arilla&#8217;s experiences are interspersed with quotes from Carlos Bulosan&#8217;s <em>America is in the Heart</em>. Reading these quotes alongside Arilla&#8217;s modern experiences gives a special poignancy to Bulosan&#8217;s &#8220;old&#8221; writings, which are still incredibly relevant today. In a media atmosphere where the stories of Filipinos are either rarely told or outright suffocated, it&#8217;s moving to remember that we <em>do</em> have stories, that we have a history. We don&#8217;t drift to America as &#8220;minority&#8221; individuals separate and small, but that we follow and build on the work and words that have come before us.</li>
</ul>




<h2><em>Seeking Asian Female</em></h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/seeking_asian_female.jpg" alt="Poster for Seeking Asian Female, depicting a white man and a Chinese woman in wedding attire, and the director of the documentary, a Chinese woman."/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/seeking-asian-female-m100102931">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote><em>seeking asian female</em> is an eccentric modern love story about Steven and Sandy—an aging white man with “yellow fever” who is obsessed with marrying any Asian woman, and the young Chinese bride he finds online. Debbie, a Chinese American filmmaker, documents and narrates with skepticism and humor, from the early stages of Steven’s search, through the moment Sandy steps foot in America for the first time, to a year into their precarious union. Global migration, Sino-American relations and the perennial battle of the sexes, weigh in on the fate of their marriage in this intensely captivating personal documentary. (<a href="http://www.seekingasianfemale.com/the-film/">Seeking Asian Female</a>)</blockquote>


<p>I&rsquo;ve been dying to see <em>Seeking Asian Female</em> since coming across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbGrQe17cU">the trailer</a> a year or two ago. Watching it at the Seattle Asian-American Film Festival was particularly gratifying, as the entire theater was groaning and laughing every time a white person swooned about the &ldquo;servant girl&rdquo;-ishness and &ldquo;green papaya fragrance&rdquo; of the Asian women they saw (and smelled?) in their minds.</p>

<p>Why you should watch it:</p>

<ul><li>It&#8217;s as hilarious as it is cringe-worthy. You cringe and laugh as you cringe.</li>
<li>The story is well told.</li>
<li>The director does a great job telling the story of Sandy, the &#8220;Asian Female&#8221; of this film, and also examines the ethics of herself being in the middle of this relationship.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m happy that something like the Seattle Asian-American Film Festival exists, and hope it continues next year. Watching both movies, I was reminded of N&rsquo;s quote at our last AB meeting: &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t tell our stories, our stories tell us.&rdquo;</p>

    <updated>2014-02-04T14:07:09-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/02/04/yay-anime</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting <em>really</em> into anime and manga again, which happens occasionally. The last time this happened was with <a href="http://blog.neauro.com/2012-11-14-sword-art-online-so-pretty">Sword Art Online</a>, an anime I loved until the second season, which led the story down into an incestuous love triangle and a hideous, totally unncessary sexual assault scene.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an overview of some anime/manga I&rsquo;ve found recently.</p>

<h2>Anime: Kuragehime / 海月姫 / Princess Jellyfish</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/animango/kuragehime_anime.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Kuragehime anime"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://sleepisfortheweak.org/reviews/micros/princessjellyfish">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>Amamizukan is an apartment complex where no boys are allowed. Tsukimi, a girl who adores jellyfish, lives there happily with her friends who all have nerdy obsessions of their own. Their peaceful lives gradually start to change when a beautiful woman helps Tsukimi out of a pinch. She stays overnight at the apartments—but it turns out &#8220;she&#8221; is really a &#8220;he&#8221;. (<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=11282">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>Status: Complete. Genre: Jousei/Romance/Comedy.</p>

<p>H has been heavily encouraging me to watch this series for years and I finally set aside time for it after finding it on Netflix!</p>

<p>Reasons why you should watch it:</p>

<ul><li>It&#8217;s legitimately hilarious. Even A, who generally despises anime, enjoyed it. <em>This is really saying something.</em></li>
<li>There are varied female characters! With varied appearances and varied interests!</li>
<li>Kuranosuke&#8217;s crossdressing/femme presentation isn&#8217;t used by the main cast as something to belittle him.</li>
<li>Surprisingly, it&#8217;s the only story I&#8217;ve ever consumed where I didn&#8217;t really mind the love triangle and felt like I was rooting for both sides of it.</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul> <li>The ending is pretty sudden.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Manga: Kuragehime / 海月姫 / Princess Jellyfish, HIGASHIMURA Akiko</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/animango/kuragehime_manga.jpg" alt="Picture from Kuragehime manga"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.mangareader.net/kuragehime">via</a>)</p>




<blockquote>Kuragehime follows Tsukimi Kurashita, an 18-year-old who moved from Kagoshima to Tokyo to become an illustrator. Tsukimi is a jellyfish otaku who comes to live in a shared bath and toilet, women-only apartment, Amamizukan. Other tenants include fujoshi, NEETs and others who consider fashion their natural enemy, calling themselves &#8220;Amars&#8221;. One day, Tsukimi meets a fashionable and beautiful girl, Kuranosuke Koibuchi, who saves a jellyfish that is about to die at a pet shop. She later discovers that Kuranosuke is merely cross-dressing in order to evade inheritance of his father&#8217;s occupation as a politician. (<a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=38146">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>Status: Ongoing. Genre: Jousei/Romance/Comedy.</p>

<p>Being dissatisfied with the anime&rsquo;s ending, I chased up the manga.</p>

<p>Reasons why you should read it:</p>

<ul><li>Though the rendering of events isn&#8217;t as funny as in the anime, it&#8217;s still pretty cute.</li>
<li>(spoilers) <span class="spoiler">The manga doesn&#8217;t make it look as if Shuu is falling in love with the woman sexually blackmailing him, which is good.</span></li>
<li>The author also has short manga detailing events in her own life, and they&#8217;re *such funny wow*.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Manga: Dengeki Daisy / 電撃デイジー, MOTOMI Kyousuke</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/animango/dengeki_daisy.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Kuragehime anime"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://dengekidaisy.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Chapters">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>After orphan Teru Kurebayashi loses her beloved older brother, she finds solace in the messages she exchanges with Daisy, an enigmatic figure who can only be reached through the cell phone her brother left her. Meanwhile, Teru meets and forms a strange friendship with mysterious Tasuku Kurosaki, her school&#8217;s janitor. For some reason, Kurosaki always seems to be around whenever Teru needs help which leads Teru to wonder: Could Daisy be a lot closer than she thinks?</br></br>

As the mystery of Daisy unfolds, Teru also discovers that there may have been a lot more to the life and death of her brother than she ever dreamed&#8230;and that the man she thought was her friend just might have all the answers.(<a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=13582">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>Status: Ongoing. Genre: Shoujo/Romance/Comedy.</p>

<p>This was recommended to me by Tumblr friends.</p>

<p>Reasons why you should read it:</p>

<ul><li>It&#8217;s <em>so cute wow</em>. If you need a heavy dose of thick, syrupy shoujo, this is it. <em>This is it.</em></li>
<li>Teru The Protagonist is an awesome female lead, and though there are some &#8220;damsel&#8221; moments, she mostly has impressive/fun moments where she saves herself and the entire day just when the author leads you to expect the opposite. (Wow such subversive!)</li>
<li>Teru also has friendships with other girls, both of whom she confides in and supports throughout the series.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a girl who could totally be slut-shamed, <em>and she isn&#8217;t</em>.</li>
<li>This series is the first I&#8217;ve seen to depict a relationship growing significantly through communicating with each other digitally, which is pretty tight.</li>
<li>The main male lead is a HACKER! :&#8217;D</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul><li>It&#8217;s really cheesy. <em>Really cheesy</em>. When you&#8217;re not getting cavities, you&#8217;re drowning in cheese. Though really, depending on your mood, this is kind of a plus.</li></ul>




<h2>Manga: Kamisama Hajimemashia | 神様はじめました / Kamisama Kiss, SUZUKI Julietta</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/animango/kh_manga.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Kuragehime anime"/></p>

<blockquote> Momozono Nanami’s dad, a man with a penchant for gambling, disappeared after accumulating a huge amount of debt. Thus, she was chased out of her house by the debt collectors. When she met a timid guy being chased by a dog, he told her that he’d give her his house. She believed his persuasive talk, but when she went to his house… it turned out to be a shrine. Moreover, a guy with fox ears appeared, which made Nanami even more confused. What will become of homeless and confused Nanami? (<a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=24388">via</a>) </blockquote>


<p>Status: Ongoing. Genre: Shoujo/Supernatural/Romance/Comedy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve actually been reading this for a while, but it&rsquo;s worth another shout-out because I&rsquo;ve been re-reading it and it&rsquo;s one of my favorite series to date, right up there with <em>Full Metal Panic!</em>.</p>

<p>Reasons why you should read it:</p>

<ul><li>The supernatural premise is fun, and the majority of the characters have a lot of charm. (The only one I can&#8217;t totally get behind is Mizuki, mostly because he seems the most unnecessary to the plot.)</li>
<li>Nanami The Protagonist gets stuff done! Woo!</li>
<li>Tomoe is a well-developed male lead. He has bangs, a dark past, animal ears, cooking skills — everything you could ever possibly desire on this imperfect earth.</li>
<li>I really love Suzuki-sensei&#8217;s unconventional-looking art style.</li>
<li>*Time paradox!*</li></ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul><li>Recent chapters (specifically, 92 and 107) have had some uncomfortable dubcon scenes. Ultimately Suzuki-sensei has handled these scenes in an <em>alright</em> way&#8230;but I wish she&#8217;d have her characters call out and condemn the problematic aspects head-on.</li>
<li>The story recently has also been slowing down and felt uncomfortably off-pace, though I&#8217;m not giving up on it just yet.</li></ul>

<blockquote>After her father having run away due to gambling debts, and being evicted from her apartment, Nanami meets Mikage, a strange man who is afraid of dogs. Nanami &#8220;saves&#8221; Mikage from a dog and tells him her story. He gives Nanami his house as a thank you for saving him. Nanami accepts the offer, due to having nowhere else to go. Mikage draws her up a map showing her where to go. Upon arriving, she finds that it is a rundown shrine. Nanami is then almost killed by Tomoe, who was expecting Mikage to finally return after his 20 year absence. She is then greeted by both Onikiri and Kotetsu, as the new land god of the shrine. Unable to accept Nanami as the new land god, Tomoe mocks her then leaves the shrine, which, without Tomoe&#8217;s power transforms back into a run-down state. Not wanting to rob Tomoe of his home and realizing that her powers as a god are too weak anyway Nanami leaves, but eventually is brought back by Tomoe after she seals a contract with him, making him her familiar.

<p>
Status: Complete. Genre: Shoujo/Supernatural/Romance/Comedy.</p>

<p>Reasons why you should watch it:</p>

<ul><li>Nanami&#8217;s voice actress is perfectly casted. <em>Perfectly.</em></li>
<li>If you enjoyed the manga, you&#8217;d probably also enjoy seeing some of the scenes animated?</li></ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul><li>Nanami has less agency in the anime, and I don&#8217;t Recent chapters (specifically, 92 and 107) have had some uncomfortable dubcon scenes.

<p>How could I not watch this? After all, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/swimming-anime"><em>the series that Tumblr made</em></a>.</p>

<p>Reasons why you should watch it:</p>

<ul><li>The animation is pretty. I even read on Tumblr that the actual swimming movements were pretty accurate. <em>Neat</em>.</li></ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul><li>The story is just alright.</li>
<li>Queer-baiting (used extensively here) is boring.</li></ul>




<h2>Anime: Kyoukai no Kanata / 境界の彼方 / Beyond the Boundary</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/animango/knk.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Kuragehime anime"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.zerochan.net/1570806">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>Akihito Kanbara is a high school sophomore in the literature club who believes himself to be a &#8220;Meganest&#8221;, and although he appears to be human, he is actually half Yōmu, which makes him invulnerable to wounds, due to the fact that he can heal so quickly, and also immortal. One day, Akihito meets freshman Mirai Kuriyama when it appears as if she is about to attempt suicide by jumping off of the school rooftop. Mirai is isolated because of her ability to manipulate blood, which is considered heresy even among other members of the underworld, so she is shunned. Soon after Akihito saves Mirai, disturbing events begin to arise. (<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=15546">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>Status: Complete. Genre: Action/Romance/Comedy/Fantasy.</p>

<p>I was lured into watching this anime because of the gorgeous animation and my instant affinity for the main character, who has red glasses not totally unlike my own. Also, &ldquo;meganest&rdquo; in the description above stands for the fact that Akihito is really into women who wear glasses.</p>

<p>Reasons why you should watch it:</p>

<ul><li>Like <em>Free!</em>, also by Kyoto Animation, the animation (especially with the fight scenes) is gorgeous.</li>
<li>If, like me, you are a sucker for the forbidden romance between a &#8220;demon-type person&#8221; and &#8220;demon-slayer-type person&#8221; — well, here it is.</li>
<li>I love the ending song, which is Stereo Dive Foundation&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaHx6oENn9s">Daisy</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://seventhstyle.com/2013/08/10/kyoukai-no-kanata-goes-moeblob-in-anime-pv/">The moeblob is strong with this one.</a></li>
<li>The ending was rushed and I&#8230;still don&#8217;t really get what happened.</li>
<li>The two main male characters are overly obsesssed with their fetishes. It&#8217;s annoying at least and disturbing at worst, especially since the girl characters they&#8217;re focusing their fetishes on are clearly uncomfortable.</li>
<li>To be honest, this series as a whole fell flat for me, but the eyecandy was quite filling.</li></ul>

    <link href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/01/21/opera-mini/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-21T10:38:15-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/01/21/opera-mini</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It came to my attention recently that not only are the majority of the users for one of my projects using Opera Mini, but that Opera Mini has a Very Special way of dealing with Javascript.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-mini-web-content-authoring-guidelines/#javascript">their authoring guidelines</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
while Mini supports JavaScript just as well as Opera Desktop, interactivity is somewhat more limited. When the user clicks a link or a button, then the Mini client sends that information back to the server, where the server performs the associated action (such as loading a new page, executing some JavaScript, etc.).
<br/><br/>
For authors, the upshot of all this is that once a page has been rendered by the server, it won&#8217;t change until the user does something on that and there is no way for scripts to run in the background. The user must do something to make Mini talk to the server in order for JavaScript to be unpaused. As a result, you cannot expect things like JavaScript animations or timed Ajax updates to work in the background as they would on a desktop browser.
<br/><br/>
JavaScript running on the Mini server will only run for a couple of seconds before pausing, for resource constraint reasons. This applies to JavaScript run due to an event firing e.g. onload, as well as code run because of a user action.</blockquote>


<p>I&rsquo;m still working on getting it properly working, which seems impossible given the bulk of Javascript used in this case and its heavy reliance on Ajax.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After about seven years with the same litle phone, I finally decided to upgrade. If I&rsquo;m being honest, I did it because the iPhone 5S/5C camera seemed like such an improvement over the previous, and I really wanted to have access to a camera usable in ordinary situations. (My old Motorola was also starting to have problems — bad audio, bad button sensitivity.)</p>

<p>The pictures that my phone takes are great — better than the pictures my old work iPod had, and definitely better than no pictures taken at all. But, what makes my silly phone photos really fun and gorgeous is the <a href="http://vsco.co/vscocam">VSCO Cam app</a>.</p>

<p>You can take pictures from the app or import them, and then control expore, temperature, white balance, saturation&hellip;I have to admit, though, that it took me forever to realize that bottom bar that showed all these editing options is actually something you can scroll from left to right.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/vscobar.png" alt="a photo of a girl"/></p>

<p class="caption">these colors were seriously bland and boring before i edited it.<br/>and,there&#8217;s that bar. it doesn&#8217;t look scrollable at all.</p>


<p>There are also a variety of filters which, to me, are way more subtle and attractive than Instagram&rsquo;s filters. I admit that I use the F2 filter way more than the others.</p>

<blockquote>Seventeen-year-old Ismae escapes from the brutality of an arranged marriage into the sanctuary of the convent of St. Mortain, where the sisters still serve the gods of old. Here she learns that the god of Death Himself has blessed her with dangerous gifts—and a violent destiny. If she chooses to stay at the convent, she will be trained as an assassin and serve as a handmaiden to Death. To claim her new life, she must destroy the lives of others.
<br/><br/>

Ismae’s most important assignment takes her straight into the high court of Brittany—where she finds herself woefully under prepared—not only for the deadly games of intrigue and treason, but for the impossible choices she must make. For how can she deliver Death’s vengeance upon a target who, against her will, has stolen her heart?
<Br/><br/>

— Grave Mercy</blockquote>




<blockquote>
When Sybella arrived at the doorstep of St Mortain half mad with grief and despair the convent were only too happy to offer her refuge - but at a price. The sisters of this convent serve Death, and with Sybella naturally skilled in both the arts of death and seduction, she could become one of their most dangerous weapons.
<br/><br/>
But her assassin&#8217;s skills are little comfort when the convent returns her to the life that nearly drove her mad. Her father&#8217;s rage and brutality are terrifying, and her brother&#8217;s love is equally monstrous. But when Sybella discovers an unexpected ally she discovers that a daughter of Death may find something other than vengeance to live for&#8230;
<Br/><br/> 
— Dark Triumph</blockquote>


<p>A coworker lent me <em>Grave Mercy</em> and <em>Dark Triumph</em>, the books currently released in the <em>His Fair Assassin</em> trilogy, and I devoured them both in less than a week. They were delicious.</p>

<p>The books are set in Brittany, at a time when it is fighting for its independence against the French. There&rsquo;s a lot of political intrigue, and, as Goodreads is fond of saying, &ldquo;magical assassin nuns,&rdquo; who are the main characters of the books. Overall, they&rsquo;re fun characters to read about, poisons and daggers and conflicts and struggles all. They navigate politics, relationships, and their own identities and duties.</p>

<p>(TW) As a warning, these books contain a lot of sexual assault, especially the second book, whose protagonist, Sybella, is a survivor. Whereas sexual assault in stories is something I often eyeroll at due to its prevalent use as a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toa_vH6xGqs">grimdark fridging mechanism</a>, the use of sexual assault in <em>His Fair Assassin</em> wasn&rsquo;t trivialized, dramaticized, or used to further the motivations of another character. Sexual assault is a horrible act, and when victim-blaming occurs it is struck down as wrong. Both books explore women making choices about their sexuality, with consenting, supportive partners.</p>

<p>(It seems weird to even write the above paragraph. Like, shouldn&rsquo;t this just be <em>the way it is</em>? It seems strange to praise a book so highly for meeting what should be common guidlines for decency. Anyway. <em>His Fair Assassin</em> nails it.)</p>

<p>Something that I felt these books were lacking were that they took for granted my knowledge of European history. For example, why is Brittany rebelling against France? I wonder if Brittany&rsquo;s rebellion is just something that Everyone is aware of already; even so, it would have been nice to have in-book examples of why a French takeover would be so bad. It would&rsquo;ve also been nice to see more reasons why everyone was so willing to devote their lives to a twelve-year-old duchess. That everyone was unerringly adoring of her and willing to die for her sake was strange to me, and descriptions of her being &ldquo;wiser than her years&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t quite stand up on its own as a reason to rally behind her, especially when the world is so patriarchal.</p>

<p>This series was one of the rare cases where I loved the second book more than the first. The protagonist of the third book, Annith, has been introduced thus far as a predictably innocent character, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to where LaFevers will take her.</p>

<p class="caption">a screenshot of <A href="http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/endian">my kickstarter profile</a></p>


<p>After reading of a case in which <A href="http://rosalarian.tumblr.com/post/66303922266/alexds1-alexheberling-encik-farhan-is-a">a Kickstarter backer scammed dozens of artists</a>, one phrase stuck out to me. The phrase isn&rsquo;t in that link, and unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t find it in any others, but it goes something like: <em>[The scammer] doesn&rsquo;t give them any money, and gets to have all these projects shown on his profile</em>.</p>

<p>It made me realize Kickstarter&rsquo;s profiles worth looking at as a thing that people can actually be proud of. That appeal to a persons&rsquo;s sense of progress, and the desire to gather things. The little pie chat, especially, could be an example of <a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2010/11/endowed-progress-effect-and-game-quests/">endowed progress</a>. Even if there&rsquo;s nothing necessarily telling you, &ldquo;Go fill in your pie chart!&rdquo; the fact that it&rsquo;s <em>there</em>, and it&rsquo;s <em>incomplete</em>&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, I feel compelled to fill it up. But I&rsquo;m also the type of person that restarted my Metroid Prime save file when I realized I missed scanning the first boss.</p>

<p>Kickstarter also offers some encouragement when you click the empty slice of your pie chart.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/kickstarter2.png" alt="A screenshot of my Kickstarter profile, after clicking on the 'design' slice"/></p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;Let&#8217;s change that!&#8221;</a></p>


<p>It&rsquo;s pretty cute that the slices are all (presumably) different colors, and I&rsquo;m really tempted to fill them in with $1 pledges to relevant projects. I wonder how Kickstarter encourages users to back more projects if they have filled in all their slices?</p>

    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/01/13/football</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend I finally learned about football, something I&rsquo;ve never been terribly interested in. The most recent game I watched was Kind Of A Big Deal for the city I live in.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/sea2.jpg" alt="Rain and cars and a distant Seattle Space Needle."/></p>

<p class="caption">distant space needle.</a></p>


<p>It strikes me that football is an incredibly fun game to watch because the &ldquo;four downs&rdquo; system provides a multitude of little goals to rejoice about. Each play is rife with struggle, with a victory that can turn into loss in an instant. It reminds me of Mark Rosewater&rsquo;s description of <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/174">interaction and a catch-up feature</a> as things that &ldquo;every game needs.&rdquo; At each &ldquo;down,&rdquo; both teams have the potential not just to stop each other, but to improve their own standing. It&rsquo;s a powerful interval.</p>

<p>Watching the game this past weekend was the first time in my life that I really, finally <em>got</em> it. I didn&rsquo;t know there were separate offensive and defensive teams; I didn&rsquo;t know that there were people whose singular jobs were to run, or to kick, and that the had individual tutors. It&rsquo;s pretty inspiring.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/01/09/unicycle/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-09T15:22:52-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2014/01/09/unicycle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For HCDE 518 the theme of our projects was &ldquo;UX for Good.&rdquo; I teamed up with three others (Joshua Coppola, Irene Huberman, and Matt Yukubousky) who were interested in solving climate change, and after admitting that &ldquo;solving climate change&rdquo; was going to be out of scope for the quarter, we searched for ways that we could encourage people to make better environmental choices.</p>

<p>One problem in encouraging environmentally friendly choices is that the immediate results of such choices are often negative. Good environmental decisions don&rsquo;t pay off for the actual environment immediately, and often your only tangible &ldquo;reward&rdquo; is the fact that you&rsquo;ve spent more time or money being good, as in the case of going to farmer&rsquo;s markets to buy organic or local produce. (Though for some I know the payoff of farmer&rsquo;s markets is better-tasting food, and forming relationships with the community, etc.)</p>

<p>We were all interested in designing <em>something</em> for our nearby community, and at some point someone finally brought up the concept of &ldquo;freecycling,&rdquo; which is the term for a community that gives and gets items from each other for free. (In this sense, it&rsquo;s really more like &ldquo;free-reusing&rdquo; than &ldquo;free-recycling.&rdquo;) We realized that such a system is perfect for implementation in a college campus, where living situations are temporary and fluid, requiring people to predictably give and get furniture like beds and couches when the academic year turns. Additionally, undergraduates in particular, lacking free-flowing cash, have a need of used items like textbooks and whatever other paraphernalia required of them in classes, like clickers. Groups in Seattle exist already for freecycling, such as <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/freecycleseattle/info">Seattle Freecycle</a>, but none geared specifically for students who might need to quickly get rid of a bed before move-out, or require a specific edition of a book for a class.</p>

<p>Realizations in hand, we established our design question: <strong>How can we use technology to encourage reuse of goods within the University of Washington community?</strong></p>

<p>And after Bruce Perry came up with the perfect name for our project — <em>UniCycle</em> — we were all in.</p>

<h2>Surveys</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/unicycle/surveys.png" alt="Screenshot of some survey responses."/></p>

<p class="caption">screenshot of some survey responses</p>


<p>We developed a (somewhat long-ass) survey to kick off our user research, and distributed it across our social networks, the UW group we found at Reddit, and a Facebook group devoted to &ldquo;UW Textbook Exchange.&rdquo; The feedback we received overall to the idea of &ldquo;a site where people can easily exchange textbooks&rdquo; was very positive:</p>

<blockquote>“This idea is great and I hope it takes form soon! It eliminates the middle man like buffalo exchange that rips off the sellers and charges more for certain items to buyers to make profit.&#8221; - /u/huskygurll</blockquote>


<p>On the bright side, we learned that there are some clear pain points when students try to get rid of their stuff. Though many students desire to sell their textbooks and furniture, many do not because they don&rsquo;t want to go through the hassle of setting up prices, haggling, meeting up with people. In the case of female students, there was also the extra overhead of making sure they were safe when interacting with strangers.</p>

<p>Though we initially wanted to create a site that was devoted to <em>just</em> students giving each other things for free, students&#8217; reported consciousness of money made this unfeasible. Survey participants reported occasinally that, if they could not get enough money for Item X, they&rsquo;d rather keep it. With this in mind, we decided to design a hub for students to not just give each other things for free, but also sell or barter them away. &ldquo;Free items&rdquo; could continue to be our main headliner, however, something to draw people in the same way that Priceline draws customers with their &ldquo;name your own price&rdquo; system.</p>

<h2>Design Mapping</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/unicycle/designmapping.png" alt="Team UniCycle design mapping, and a close-up photo of the design mapping."/></p>

<p class="caption">design mapping</p>


<p>One design technique that was new to be this quarter was <strong>design mapping</strong>, which involves thinking through a user flow and taking note of everything that comes up using sticky notes. Green notes can stand for goals, pink notes for concerns, yellow for extra considerations, blue for possible new features — and so on. One thing I love about design mapping is that you are able to keep track of everything. When talking about how to support Yosh&rsquo;s desire to buy an old couch online, we don&rsquo;t need to silence the person that starts talking about bed bugs, and chastise them for going off-topic — we just add it to the map, and continue forward.</p>

<p>Design mapping helped us get a grip on the kinds of behaviors that we wanted to support with UniCycle: buy a used item, put a used item up for sale, contact a seller, and so on.</p>

<h2>Sketches</h2>


<p>We did a ton of sketches. Just, tons of them.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/unicycle/sketches2.png" alt="Sketching UniCycle UI on a whiteboard."/></p>

<p class="caption">here are just a few of them</p>


<p>I have to admit that it was hard to come up with so many ideas individually and then have to figure out how to actually move forward. It took us most of the afternoon, a huge whiteboard, and a lot of back-and-forth to decide on the almost-final interface that we wanted to go with, Once we did decide, it was tough to decide who was going to have the responsibility of moving forward with creating a paper prototype, or creating a digital prototype with something like Axure, which some of us wanted experience using.</p>

<p>It was at this time that we decided to try out a search based on &ldquo;hashtags,&rdquo; like Twitter or Tumblr. Because people could sell a variety of items on this site, we thought this would best allow them to categorize their items as they see fit. Additionally, hashtags like <code>#chem300</code> could be catch-alls for whatever you needed for a Chemistry 300 course: textbooks, clickers, lab coats, and so on.</p>

<h2>Paper Prototyping</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/unicycle/paperprototype.png" alt="Photos of the UniCycle paper prototype."/></p>

<p class="caption">photos of the paper prototype</p>


<p>I took partial responsibility for the paper prototype and the ensuing paper-scrap fest. Rendering the variety of items that people could &ldquo;search for&rdquo; using our paper UI was the most challenging bit, as was searching for the right pieces to show on the display. We created little modals to mimic &ldquo;Loading results&hellip;&rdquo; which were fun to use, and we also tried to solve for cases in which our paper prototype testers might search for an item that we didn&rsquo;t anticipate.</p>

<h2>Interactive Prototype</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/unicycle/unicycle_prototype.png" alt="Screenshot of UniCycle Interactive Prototype."/></p>

<p class="caption">screenshot of UniCycle&#8217;s interactive prototype</p>


<p>Our final product was an interactive prototype made in Axure by all of us, using a pretty fantastic blend of Axure&rsquo;s built-in SVN versioning and Dropbox. It is currently hosted <a href="http://students.washington.edu/jhc1/hcde518/start.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>My most beloved aspects of it are those that give feedback to users&#8217; actions. For example, the main page features tickets that enumerate the number of goods reused thus far, to surface the fact that people really <em>are</em> accomplishing something great through their small actions.</p>

<p>We also have some special tweaks just for UW students. For example, if you are looking for a particular textbook, you can list it on UniCycle. If you&rsquo;re selling, you can list a book by ISBN and have the titles and authors filled in automatically. Once you list a book, you are also made aware of the number of people who might already have that book marked as &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; — which is intended to help people feel like it&rsquo;s easy to sell on UniCycle. We also surface &ldquo;duedates&rdquo; for items, valuable if a user is trying to get rid of a bed before their lease is up.</p>

<p>After having dealt with it for a majority of the quarter, I&rsquo;m not totally sold on Axure yet, and will not likely use it to personally make hi-fidelity prototypes in the future. At that point in the process, I&rsquo;d just prefer to code things up myself. Additionally, I personally love the speed and humble honesty of paper prototyping, compared to Axure&rsquo;s interactive prototypes, which to me slip somewhat into the uncanny valley.</p>

<p>That being said, I&rsquo;m sure there will come a time when Axure is uniquely valuable, and I did like having to <em>not</em> worry about vertically centering random elements in CSS. Coding UniCycle as the sole programmer in a team of four would have been extremely taxing and it&rsquo;s nice that using Axure allowed us to work on a level playing field.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>


<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ll return to UniCycle given the plethora of other projects I have, but it would be great to see it go places, especially given the need for it at UW. Too much goes wasted, and I&rsquo;d love to see people get into the habit of asking their community for needed items, as well as help others when it&rsquo;s needed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also made a <a href="http://blog.neauro.com/files/hcde518_portfolio_deck.pdf">portfolio deck</a> that goes over other details for this project.</p>

<p>This time the theme was <em>Monster</em> and for this story I have to admit that I was heavily inspired by <em>Howl&rsquo;s Moving Castle</em> and <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>. <a href="https://twitter.com/couch_crusader">Chris</a> helped me come up with a name for my main character, though I hope that name isn&rsquo;t <em>too</em> obvious.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still working on a place to host my writing online. For now, if you&rsquo;re in Seattle, you can pick up a copy at Bulldog News!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m into my last couple months as a UW student, and these are my last couple months to submit to <a href="http://strayingfromreality.wordpress.com/">AU</a>, UW&rsquo;s speculative fiction journal. Since the <a href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2012-12-30-short-story-golemists-work.html">last time I&rsquo;ve written about it</a> I&rsquo;ve had two more acceptances! The story that I&rsquo;ll talk about in this post is <em>Chronectomy</em>, written for the Winter 2012, Issue VIII prompt: <em>chronos</em>, or time.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="http://blog.neauro.com/images/chronectomy2.JPG" alt="Chronectomy!"/></p>

<p class="caption">Chronectomy! I LOVE what the editors did with the &#8220;O&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>


<p>I came up with an idea almost immediately and wrote furiously for a couple hours before realizing I was writing entirely the wrong story, and redid the entire thing. I&rsquo;m still working on a place to host my short stories online, but at least for now you can read <em>Chronectomy</em> on <a href="http://neauro.com">my portfolio</a>.</p>

<p>[ spoilers follow ]</p>

<p>I was really happy with the way I described the chronectomy clinic in this draft, but there were a couple problems overall that made me realize I had to totally redo it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I intended this draft&#8217;s appeal to be that the audience has no idea what&#8217;s going on, but I realized that I wanted to write something a little deeper. In this draft, once you realize that the clinic is about removing memories, there&#8217;s not much else to get out of it.</li>
  <li>The protagonist of this draft, Alice, doesn&#8217;t have a very clear motive. Again, I was relying on there to be some kind of &#8220;Oohh, why is she here?&#8221; feeling to pull the audience through, but I wasn&#8217;t confident that all this exposition and description would be fun to read on its own, when you don&#8217;t even know why the character is there.</li>
  <li>At the end, I wanted to pull a sort of &#8220;Whoa! Bet you didn&#8217;t see that coming!&#8221; moment, where the clinician suddenly steals the protagonist&#8217;s memories for himself — but I realized that by the time you reach the end, you don&#8217;t know enough about him at all to care that he stole her memories, nor do you know why he did so. You also never know the protagonist well enough to care that her memories were stolen, since she&#8217;s shrouded in mystery for the draft&#8217;s majority.</li>
  <li>Since the original prompt was related to &#8220;time,&#8221; my initial intention was to explore what people would do with time — selling it, donating it, using it to heal their mental trauma, and so on. When the clinician starts reciting all these uses to the protagonist, I realized that those things were all way more interesting than what was happening right then in the story, and that furthermore, all these uses were just being talked about, and not actually experienced.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, I realized the better perspective to use for this story was not Alice but the clinician, and why he would steal someone else&rsquo;s memory in the first place.</p>

<p>Draft below the cut.</p>

<hr/>


<p>The clinic was a low building perched on a strip, cornered between a sit-down pho place and a hole-in-the-wall that dispensed frozen yogurt from ancient, sticky machines. It was delicious, in part because of the sheer novelty of getting yogurt from a machine you expected would only cough out rust and coppery water. And it was cheap — a dollar six for a cup that sat easily in your palm, and only fifty cents more for a tablespoon of chopped pineapple and chocolate chips.</p>

<p>Her lips pursed and she felt tears well in her eyes. It made the building, already blurry with heat, even more hazy and dream-like. There were protestors lined up on the curb outside the clinic and she marched across the parking lot clutching the bulky duffel bag like a shield. As she approached, one of the protestors stabbed his spork into a soft boulder of yogurt freckled with rainbow sprinkles, and lifted one of the signs that was leaning on the clinic wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of life is a gift,&rdquo; he managed loudly, and as yogurt spilled on his shirt the rest of the group cackled. A girl hit him playfully on the shoulder. It seemed the appointment was during the high school shift.</p>

<p>She tried not to look at them, but couldn&rsquo;t help glancing down as she stepped over their polished legs. One girl cried, &ldquo;Just be strong! Don&rsquo;t throw yourself away!&rdquo; And one boy called, &ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ll buy you a yogurt if you cancel,&rdquo; and the girls again squealed with feigned indignation between yogurt-dripping laughs.</p>

<p>She swallowed and reached for the door. There was a sticker on it, a logo of beige hands holding two sides of an hourglass and pouring the grains from one side into the other. Her sweating palms slid on the searing metal of the door handle and she winced. The laughter rang in her ears. One of the boys had a familiar laugh, bright, the too-loud kind that was swollen with all the air in his lungs and was let out in booms that encompassed everyone an drew them in. Her heart clenched. And she yanked the door as hard as she could.</p>

<p>The door rattled fiercely and did not open. Her perspiring hand slipped off the handle and she nearly fell back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to push,&rdquo; the boy told her, and pronounced each with so slowly that she had pushed the door and moved inside before he finished the sentence.</p>

<p>It was air-conditioned inside, and the cool air soothed her flushed cheeks. After the outside, which had been blurry with heat, the details of the inside of the clinic seemed unreasonably sharp. There was no chrome in sight, no blustering or chirping machines, no bubbling beakers. The walls were off-white and decorated with fake paintings of pastel flowers straining as if to escape their plastic frames. The furniture was like stuff she might have seen in a normal doctor&rsquo;s office, plastic cushions that were easy to clean and squeaked a little when she set her bag down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning! I can help you here,&rdquo; said the person at the counter, a man her age who had just walked in and was tugging a white doctor&rsquo;s coat sleeve hastily over a tattoo on his forearm. She approached cautiously, eyes cast on the little bit of ink she could see beyond the cuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Film,&rdquo; he explained with a smile, and tugged the sleeve up to show her, a tattoo&rsquo;d sleeve of cinema tape encircling a tab arm. &ldquo;They like that I keep it under wraps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made her mouth into a smile for him. He had had a tattoo too — also a sleeve, though the opposite arm. He had gotten it on a trip he had taken by himself to Hawand it symbolized &ldquo;freedom.&rdquo; (Now she wondered, Freedom from what? And, He probably was lying about going alone, wasn&rsquo;t he?)</p>

<p>She managed to uncoil her knotting throat and said, &ldquo;Thanks for taking me on such short notice. I saw the clinic isn&rsquo;t usually open at this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled at her. &ldquo;No problem. It does keep the protestors off our back to accept patients at strange times. Those kids they post out there don&rsquo;t really care one way or another.&rdquo; He gestured at a door in the lounge. &ldquo;You wanna come back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t I fill out some paperwork or something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He cocked his head. &ldquo;Do you want to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And have a trail that connected her with a chronectomy, something that future employers would find and wonder and not give her the benefit of a doubt about?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, no paperwork. I will need payment up front though. In case you forget later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I heard that I could get any fees waived if I&hellip;donated&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all you need to fill out is this waiver.&rdquo; He slid a pink slip toward her and she plucked a pen from a little hourglass container where it had been stabbed upright into sand-colored lentils. She read it briefly and checked the appropriate boxes.</p>

<p>I agree to donate. I understand my donation waives all fees.</p>

<p>I understand I will not be able to review the [something something — a Latin word]. I agree they will be the sole property of Chosen Life, to dispose of at will.</p>

<p>There was a signature area at the bottom. She hadn’t been asked for ID. She considered and then wrote Alice on the line. Who cared?</p>

<p>She marked the right boxes and slid the paper back. He looked at it briefly and then filed it away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, gesturing to a door connecting the lounge and the back of the clinic, &ldquo;follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated. Wariness bloomed in her. It was strange that the clinic was empty; it was strange that the only person here was a man, and a pretty young one at that, maybe nothing more than an intern. But she had trusted her gut before and it had let her down, further than she had ever known she could go. She walked through the door.</p>

<p>The clinician was waiting for her on the other side. He led we through a small hallway. &ldquo;What was your name, again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; she decided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Alice,&rdquo; he said, opening a door for her, &ldquo;you can call me Liu. I&rsquo;m not a doctor — not yet — but I am a certified chronectomist. Please have a seat. We can have you out of here in fifteen minutes, max.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Liu was some kind of neotech grad student. Just like&hellip;</p>

<p>Stop. Don&rsquo;t even start. She forced herself to take a breath, which juddered in her throat. She expected one of the long tables with adjustable height and a paper on it, but the room had a divan like her psychiatrist. She hesitated when she saw it and Liu laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of that feely-weepy stuff here. Just make yourself comfortable while I set up.&rdquo; He glanced up at the clock in the room and then began to rummage around the drawers, fumbling with white plastic instruments sealed in bags.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I ask a couple questions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! Fire away. And hold out your right arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pulled back her sleeve and he velcroed a strap over her arm that squeezed it uncomfortably.</p>

<p>She swallowed. &ldquo;Is it true that I&rsquo;ll age a little bit? Physically?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled, as if to say, It&rsquo;s okay, I get this question all the time. &ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t. The procedure is called a chronectomy, but what&rsquo;s really extracted are memories — the footprints of time on your brain. If anything, technically, you’ll be getting a little younger. Hmm, looks like your blood pressure’s just a tad low.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Is that okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; He turned and reached for one of the instruments that was unearthed. Curious, she strained to see. There were two rings. &ldquo;Now, hold out your middle fingers. Politely, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that I might lose other memories I don&rsquo;t want to?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope, and you’ll see why in a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happens to them? After they&rsquo;re&hellip;after I donate them? I know I won’t have a say in them anymore, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It’s fine, I can answer that. A couple things can happen to them.&rdquo; He had a little vial and waggled it around as he spoke. &ldquo;Usually it gets sold. Depending on the content, you can help other people with it — sometimes the government will buy it for war veterans — ’time heals all wounds,’ you know. Psychologists and the like can use it for research. And — this is not Chosen Life, understand, but in the black markets — sometimes people come and they’ll sell their memories of studying for a test to richer students. There are growing markets over in Asia where people are selling hours of studying for a pretty prime price. It’s fascinating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spoken like a true grad student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, it all depends on the memory. Are you ready to get started?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She swallowed. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Liu nodded. He rolled a tray beside her and, after unpackaging it, handed it to her. It was a simple mask, like a.surgeon’s mask, but made of soft cotton. He put one on as we&rsquo;ll, but it was impermeable pale green plastic and rubber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put this on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did. The mask&rsquo;s rubber band was too tight and quickly tangled in her hair. Liu tugged it a couple times and when he was certain it was secure around her mouth and nose he rapped the vial one last time against his palm and then opened it carefully. There was a dropper protruding from the inside of the lid and he filled it up with clear liquid, and pinched it onto her cotton mask.</p>

<p>It soaked into the cotton. She jumped. It had a strong smell that she wasn’t expecting. It smelled like — like —</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a deep breath,&rdquo; he told her. She had stopped breathing in panic. She took a deep breath and the smell took form. It was like drinking cold water on a hot day but instead of trickling down ice cold between her ribs it trickled upward, a fuzzy warmth that permeated against the roof of her mouth, the veins behind her eyeballs, the place in her brain that ached every morning she woke up and realized she was without him. She trembled and her eyes began to water. She felt separated from her limbs,and for that reason fumbled when Liu started to shove something into her hands. Her fingers fumbled around the strange object. It took her a while to realize it was a pen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write as you answer,&rdquo; Liu said. His voice was a whisper, but it reverberated throughout her body. &ldquo;What does it smell like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like his jacket,&rdquo; she said, through a haze. Her voice was loud. She heard her teeth clicking as she spoke, as if she were underwater. Her hand scribbled. &ldquo;Like his cologne. Like our pillows in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A is starting a certificate program in game design this quarter and I&rsquo;ve been helping him with his card game, Invent-o-thon.</p>

<p>The prompt being something related to <em>Victorian Combat</em>, he first went around researching what people &ldquo;first thought of when they think about the Victorian Era,&rdquo; and I was happy to hammer in the presence of Ada Lovelace, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">The World&rsquo;s First Computer Programmer</a>. Because I&rsquo;m more interested in stories, I also talked with him about stories — in particular, making noteworthy experiences that people are excited to talk to each other about after the fact. Or, in general, creating situations in which people&rsquo;s imaginations are prompted and stretch and fill in ridiculous gaps.</p>

<p>A obtained a bunch of card sleeves and post-it notes for our paper prototyping. The point of the game is to create an invention over several rounds, then present it at &ldquo;showtime&rdquo; to everyone and roll dice to see if your invention explodes. Thus far, players construct machines using three decks: one deck to describe a &ldquo;power source&rdquo; (like &ldquo;electric&rdquo;), one deck to describe a &ldquo;subject&rdquo; (like &ldquo;kittens&rdquo;), and one deck to describe the actual invention (like &ldquo;generator&rdquo;).</p>

<p>We also gathered friends to do a playtest at a cafe.</p>

<p class="caption">kind of pathetic pleasure chamber&#8230;and others</p>


<p>One of the most valuable things learned from prototyping was which cards were compelling and funny, and which cards weren&rsquo;t — descriptive cards that seemed perfectly fine, like &ldquo;hydro-powered&rdquo; or &ldquo;solar-powered,&rdquo; were just not as fun to use as &ldquo;perfectly ordinary&rdquo; or &ldquo;rather moist&rdquo; and never quite made it to showtime. It makes sense that something like &ldquo;perfectly ordinary&rdquo; lights up more parts of your story-minded brain than &ldquo;hydro-powered,&rdquo; and overall could have more flavor. (What&rsquo;s a &ldquo;perfectly ordinary kitten-mobile&rdquo;?)</p>

<p>I sketched out some possibilities for card designs&hellip;</p>

<p class="caption">sketches of cards</p>


<p>&hellip;and A also reined in his sister for some concept art of character roles that players could have that affected their inventions. For example, someone who was Benjamin Franklin might be able to totally swap inventions with someone else before showtime. (Oo! Sick burn!)</p>

<p class="caption">(<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/thomas-was-alone/screenshots/gameShotId,566500/">via</a>)</p>


<p><em>Thomas Was Alone</em> was super cute, if more ambiguous than I personally like. I liked the personality given to all the different shapes, though their common heroism and conceit got a little old as the game went on, which was why Laura&rsquo;s cynicism made her my favorite (though I felt compelled inexlicably to keep calling her &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo;). I loved that the levels were tilted, the play of light, the strange colors. (Though I wonder if any colorblind users had a hard time playing?)</p>

<p>One thing I think the game could have been improved was the game&rsquo;s sense of progression; though numbers ticked up each level, after a while they became meaningless, and now that the game is finished I&rsquo;m not totally sure what I would use them for. The introduction of each of the colored shapes, Thomas&rsquo;s &ldquo;death,&rdquo; and the era of the gray shapes seemed to be the largest movements in the story, and though each was accompanied with a fun snippet of &ldquo;The AIs are gaining sentience!&rdquo; flavor I didn&rsquo;t really have a sense that things were reaching their end until the end came suddenly to meet me. Some levels seemed like little &ldquo;drabbles&rdquo; and experiments, which I completed without much more effort than would take for me to click a cow in Farmville, and it would have been cool to see something else related to AIs breaking their previous ways of being. Breaking through the borders of levels — intentionally disobeying orders — something to add to the flavor text.</p>

<p>I played <em>Thomas Was Alone</em> on a projector and if you have the opportunity to do so yourself I recommend it. All those rectangles are like way better when they&rsquo;re as big as your face.</p>
