    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
The other day I tried applying to a job through the Amazon Careers website, and the experience was pretty interesting.<br /><br />The normal Amazon Careers website has a frame to the right which is the container for search results and job details.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tiEdJuD-92M/TlSShbRW-4I/AAAAAAAAAXU/VASbkoT6w2I/s1600/amazon2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tiEdJuD-92M/TlSShbRW-4I/AAAAAAAAAXU/VASbkoT6w2I/s640/amazon2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">aww yeah. &nbsp;so much opportunity for employment</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hjc2SGREjoo/TlSSmNRiiBI/AAAAAAAAAXc/r6P_kWXshuo/s1600/amazon3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="346" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hjc2SGREjoo/TlSSmNRiiBI/AAAAAAAAAXc/r6P_kWXshuo/s640/amazon3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the first listing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Unfortunately for me at the time, I was given a direct link to an internship which filled up the entire page.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FQD3hDyeSd0/TlSYFVqLdtI/AAAAAAAAAYE/v_ascKp2iqA/s1600/amazon22.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FQD3hDyeSd0/TlSYFVqLdtI/AAAAAAAAAYE/v_ascKp2iqA/s640/amazon22.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">does the font need to be that small?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I think the link itself is deprecated because I couldn't find the job by searching through Amazon Careers, but I didn't know this at the time. And the last time I tried to apply for a job to Amazon before this was a couple months ago, so I already had a profile, albeit completely unrelated to the position that I was applying for now.  Still, I pressed "Apply Now," thinking that I could change that information before submitting.<br /><br />But the next page that showed up said, merely,<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpDjHR0C2c/TlSSxH52sVI/AAAAAAAAAXs/gJqwGgMfelY/s1600/amazon7%2B--%2Bstep%2B4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpDjHR0C2c/TlSSxH52sVI/AAAAAAAAAXs/gJqwGgMfelY/s640/amazon7%2B--%2Bstep%2B4.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wait...what about the first three steps?!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />"Step 4 of 4" could only mean "This is the last step before submitting your application," so I applaud the transparency of it. &nbsp;Still, for some reason I went and clicked through anyway, thinking that I'd still be able to change what irrelevant or old information that I had on file.  I didn't.  Ack!<br /><br />So I searched in haste for "My Account" to put in my application information. When I eventually found it It looks like this:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zp07gj5RBmI/TlSS07TDhJI/AAAAAAAAAX0/vzDs1gLiq5I/s1600/amazon5%2B--%2Byour%2Baccount.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zp07gj5RBmI/TlSS07TDhJI/AAAAAAAAAX0/vzDs1gLiq5I/s640/amazon5%2B--%2Byour%2Baccount.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">unexpectedly sparse</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The text is, to me, a little small for a page that has nothing else on it.  I guess it's easily remedied by just increasing the font size. &nbsp;(Also, is that a dangling list element?)<br /><br />The "Your Profile" page is similar.  This is where you fill in all the information that will be used to apply to whatever job at Amazon that you so desire.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Wm2YVsUul4/TlSS67FYm4I/AAAAAAAAAX8/ETuOW4i4FfM/s1600/amazon6%2B--%2Byour%2Bprofile.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Wm2YVsUul4/TlSS67FYm4I/AAAAAAAAAX8/ETuOW4i4FfM/s640/amazon6%2B--%2Byour%2Bprofile.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is everything Amazon needs to know about you.<br />name, address, and the last three degrees you earned (not pictured)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />So then I uploaded my profile, and...what? &nbsp;I'm still not quite sure whether the updated information is being used for the application that I had already submitted.  I imagine that it is, but even so, a confirmation would be nice.<br /><br />These are the things that I wish had been different about this process in general:<br /><ul><li><strong>I want to see what information you're submitting to a job</strong>.  Or, at least, a recap of what steps 1, 2, and 3 had been before I went through step 4.  Even now, months after first creating my account, I can't reconstruct what the previous steps would have been.  "Sign up, Fill in Information, Find Job and Apply?"</li><li><strong>I want the ability to apply to jobs that are completely different in nature.</strong>  In particular, I wish that I had been able to submit different resumes to different jobs, or that I could provide a cover letter for each one.  (I normally hate writing cover letters, but this position in particular was one that I enjoyed writing a cover letter for.  Ah, wasted effort!</li><li><strong>I want less fields about what school you went to on your Profile page</strong>.  How many applicants does Amazon have every day that have been to <em>three</em> post-high school schools?  Are there enough to justify making <em>everyone</em> go through filling this spaces in?</li><li><b>I want a notification about selection or non-selection of a position.</b>&nbsp; The whole process is pretty automatic-feeling anyway, so having a confirmation e-mail that an application was selected, or an e-mail gently letting down your hopes would be nice, haha.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><div>As a note, in order to get the "Step 4 of 4" screenshot I pretended I was applying to another arbitrary job, and the application still went through though I pressed "back" rather than the final "Submit." Out of curiosity, I just checked its status on the "Your Account" page.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DiZd3KoYPo/TlSV-PsCDwI/AAAAAAAAAYA/Mmc4a0s_LYQ/s1600/amazon8.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DiZd3KoYPo/TlSV-PsCDwI/AAAAAAAAAYA/Mmc4a0s_LYQ/s640/amazon8.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">it reads, <i>Reviewed, Not Selected.</i><br />oh well, i guess</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Which makes me think:</div><div><ul><li>Wow, someone reviewed my application fast!</li><li>Or else the computer just read through my resume quickly and tossed it out?</li><li>Wait, why are the other positions I applied to not showing up? &nbsp;Did my real application not actually go through? &nbsp;Or does this status thing just expire after a week or so?</li><li>Also, why does my application for the Design Intern position still say that my application is already on file, when this page obviously doesn't have it listed?</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>In conclusion: I have a weird feeling that people don't really get jobs through career websites, but through career fairs and internal connections, so I suspect the entire site is just a front anyway, haha.<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b>&nbsp;Oh! &nbsp;I did receive an automated "We received your application!" e-mail for the job I arbitrarily applied to just to obtain a screenshot. &nbsp;But it still reads "Reviewed, Not Selected" on the status page.<br /><br />¯\_(ツ)_/¯</div></div></div></div>

There is one thing in particular that I wish Skype would change about its UI, and I think it's mostly influenced by my experience using another <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/05/playerio-thoughts-on-bigdb.html">2.0-y bright blue user interface</a>.<br /><br />I'm talking about the little side menu that comes up over your chat messages, which offers you a variety of possible actions for that message.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sgPTg-1XhdE/TkNONrn37eI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/ejBSr5mVeLw/s1600/skype2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="116" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sgPTg-1XhdE/TkNONrn37eI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/ejBSr5mVeLw/s640/skype2.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">man, I should have taken a bigger screenshot</td></tr></tbody></table><br />When I am clicking on my own chat, these are the things that I probably want to do, in order:<br /><br /><ol><li><b>Edit </b>whatever foolish, silly thing I just wrote</li><li><b>Remove</b>&nbsp;whatever now-irrelevant thing I just wrote</li></ol><div><br /></div><div>I can only imagine <b>Copy</b>&nbsp;or <b>Quote</b>&nbsp;to be useful in cases when I want to be snarky. &nbsp;(<i>I already said that! &nbsp;Exactly 5 minutes and 3 seconds ago!</i>) Or maybe if I'm cross-posting between chats? &nbsp;I don't know. &nbsp;I accept there is a use case that I haven't encountered for those options.</div><div><br /></div><div>Nevertheless, <b>what I really wish I could do in Skype is click <i>anywhere</i>&nbsp;on a chat-message of mine and have it open up into something I could immediately edit</b>, much like Player.IO's treatment of objects in its database. &nbsp;The menu could then be reserved for the lesser use cases of Removing, Copying, or Quoting.</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of the menu, could we also make that little arrow larger? &nbsp;The little arrow that opens that menu in the first place?</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V7fU6z-5WlI/TkNNvNn6bMI/AAAAAAAAAWI/3vOz8JgvCK8/s1600/2011-08-10_1256.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="120" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V7fU6z-5WlI/TkNNvNn6bMI/AAAAAAAAAWI/3vOz8JgvCK8/s640/2011-08-10_1256.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">do you see it?</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>Since there's nothing usually relevant to the right side of the chat-message anyway, it would help a lot if the hitbox for the menu was larger. &nbsp;Also, if the menu opened up automatically, instead of me having to click it...!</div><div><br /></div><div>Just thinking about it is exciting. :D</div></div>

    <link href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2011/05/08/playerio-thoughts-on-bigdb/"/>
    <updated>2011-05-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I'm in Intro to Human Centered Interaction this quarter and so can't help being a little more thoughtful about the way things are designed, especially since I'm trying to get better at designing myself.  That being said, I've also been working with <a href="http://playerio.com/">Player.IO</a> all weekend, in particular the database-side stuff, and have some good-natured criticisms.<br /><br />Firstly -- <strong>the Player.IO administration area is pretty.</strong> :D<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-07pQuEots34/Tcc9kH2tUfI/AAAAAAAAANM/P1cnKwB0S3I/s1600/nicelayoutbro.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="310" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-07pQuEots34/Tcc9kH2tUfI/AAAAAAAAANM/P1cnKwB0S3I/s640/nicelayoutbro.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">is this really all for me? &lt;3</td></tr></tbody></table><br />At a glance, everything looks very orderly and uncluttered.  Not only that, but the things you presumably want to do when you look at this page -- creating a table, adding a new object to a table, etc. -- are all very apparent.  Player.IO doesn't need to provide an intro tutorial for how to use (most of) their UI because the functions it offers are obvious.<br /><br /><strong>The layout also relies a lot on symbols to communicate ideas</strong>, i.e. the green "plus sign" for adding an object or adding a property to an object, or the red "minus sign" for deleting an object.  Luckily, there's alt text to explain what each symbol does, as I can imagine someone could get confused by the difference between "adding an object" or "adding a property to an object," especially as they both use some variation of the green plus sign.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nIL2m-A0QiI/Tcc-qlsyVfI/AAAAAAAAANU/wAv9_O7YhY4/s1600/addproperty.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="58" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nIL2m-A0QiI/Tcc-qlsyVfI/AAAAAAAAANU/wAv9_O7YhY4/s640/addproperty.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">why did this computer not take a screencap of the cursor hovering over the green plus sign?<br />the world may never know</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><strong>When you want to change an object's property, you just click it.</strong>  There's even a helpful "click to edit" text which shows whenever your cursor hovers over a property.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cbQT6dvY1yg/Tcc_HyUi85I/AAAAAAAAANc/xdSiKbLDY2s/s1600/itseasyy.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="60" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cbQT6dvY1yg/Tcc_HyUi85I/AAAAAAAAANc/xdSiKbLDY2s/s640/itseasyy.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">it's easy!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Once you click a property, you click "Okay" and you're all done!  <br /><br />...except, you're not. o__o One of the first things I had to get used to was the "Save Changes" button, which is what you need to press in order to finalize the changes that you've made to an object.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mFy6F-ySW2o/TdtGFefT3nI/AAAAAAAAANk/k4ca8a-Vhws/s1600/itseasyynot.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="90" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mFy6F-ySW2o/TdtGFefT3nI/AAAAAAAAANk/k4ca8a-Vhws/s640/itseasyynot.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">aaack</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The main reason why this is so easy to forget is because, other than the appearance of the button, <strong>there's no real visible indication that an object is "dirty" or has been altered and needs to be saved</strong>; and once you click "Save Changes," the only indication that you have of success is the "Save Changes" button disappearing, which just doesn't feel affirming.  It's like -- were the changes saved?  Did they fail?  Can I leave now?<br /><br /><strong>Saving your data is so subtle and anti-climatic that it's easy to forget to do it.</strong><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Md8qEM6FCQA/TdtLM5kjjCI/AAAAAAAAAN8/ZzA-sMsvkXo/s1600/waitwhatno.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Md8qEM6FCQA/TdtLM5kjjCI/AAAAAAAAAN8/ZzA-sMsvkXo/s640/waitwhatno.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wait -- wh -- nooooooooo</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then again, maybe the "Save Changes" button is the way it is because input fields to change properties opens whenever you click on a property, whether you actually wanted to change that property or not.  The only way to close out of changing a property once this happens is to say either say "okay" or "Delete." That being said, putting more prominence in the form of a confirmation message to the "Save Changes" button would probably make more sense than making the "Okay" button a "Cancel" button to close input-listening.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cbQT6dvY1yg/Tcc_HyUi85I/AAAAAAAAANc/xdSiKbLDY2s/s1600/itseasyy.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="60" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cbQT6dvY1yg/Tcc_HyUi85I/AAAAAAAAANc/xdSiKbLDY2s/s640/itseasyy.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">even if you accidentally open this input field,<br />"Okay" and "Delete"&nbsp;make more sense<br />than "Cancel" and "Delete," i suppose</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A related issue: <strong>if you happen to click on an object or an array accidentally, that object or array gets emptied of all its data</strong>.  Since no alteration you make to a property gets saved until you press "Save Changes," at least it's not a permanent emptiness; but, there's no way to undo this object/array-emptying, so to undo you need to refresh the object completely.  This can be frustrating if you've made a lot of changes to other properties in the object, and now need to cancel all those changes just to get your emptied-out object/array back.<br /><br />Speaking of arrays, <strong>it took me forever to figure out how to add an array property to an object</strong>.  It turns out that this is the proper way to do it:<br /><br /><ol><li>In your object, press "+" to create a new property.</li><li>Set the new property's value to "Value is: Array."</li><li>Press "Okay."</li><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cr-B_t0nEws/TdtMgmyrxNI/AAAAAAAAAOE/yRGeJ8foqyU/s1600/openthatarraybro.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="68" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cr-B_t0nEws/TdtMgmyrxNI/AAAAAAAAAOE/yRGeJ8foqyU/s640/openthatarraybro.png" width="640" /></a></div><li>You'll see something like the image above.  Click "Show array."</li><li>Add properties to the array one by one by clicking "+".</li></ol><br />This is a pretty roundabout method, considering that to make a value of a property an int, all you need to do is put an int in the field, then say "Okay."  When trying to put in an array, I was expecting to somehow form my input so that the values would get fed into the array automatically.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GDEP6-4WlYE/TdtItydaogI/AAAAAAAAANs/BqaI9yop1iE/s1600/inputarrayvalues.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="88" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GDEP6-4WlYE/TdtItydaogI/AAAAAAAAANs/BqaI9yop1iE/s640/inputarrayvalues.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />It's also annoying that you have to click "Show array" before adding properties to it; it would be nice if the entire array just popped open when you went to add a property to it, since that's probably what you're going to do if you're clicking an array in the first place.  Clicking anywhere in that row outside of "show array" will just bring you back to the weird input box right above "Value is: Array." This is one case in which the "+" button for adding properties is unhelpfully small. (And of course, if you miss it and accidentally click somewhere, your entire array gets emptied, as I mentioned above.)<br /><br />Anyway, when I was making this example, I noticed <strong>Player.IO does a good job of telling you when your fields are malformed</strong>.  It might be marginally nicer to put some error message like, "This field needs an int in it, because that's what you said duh" but I don't know; maybe that would mess up the minimalism.  Then again, minimalist aesthetic should be about only giving you the information you need, right?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YYD3xF1d2lU/TdtKb9qaeOI/AAAAAAAAAN0/tZRyuNqhUD4/s1600/inputxpvaluesgooderror.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="86" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YYD3xF1d2lU/TdtKb9qaeOI/AAAAAAAAAN0/tZRyuNqhUD4/s640/inputxpvaluesgooderror.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />Another miscellaneous issue: <strong>you can't do batch alterations/deletions of objects.</strong> When I go through and cleanse all my test accounts and related information, I have to delete every single object by hand, rather than just selecting them all and deleting them in a fell swoop.  Time-consuming and annoying.<br /><br />All this being said, working with Player.IO has still been tons of fun.  I would have had no idea how to implement all this back-end stuff by myself -- or at the very least, it would have taken me much longer to figure out how to do.</div>

So <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/operating%20systems">OS</a> ended, and the world didn't, and I'm taking the games capstone this quarter.  I've wanted to take this class for forever, and finally...!<br /><br />But all the initial excitement was broken by the professor's declaration on the very first day.  "The requirement this quarter is that you all have to make social games."<br /><br />A sudden discomfort in the room.  Social games?  <em>Really?</em><br /><br />We brainstormed hastily, still in shock, and during discussion exchanged mutters.  "I really wanted to make a <em>real</em> game this quarter."<br /><br />Hard to think otherwise then <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/03/the-social-games-rant-you-didnt-hear-from-gdc/">people tend to feel so visceral about social games.</a> <span class="shh">(That link is there more for the comments than the actual article.)</span>  Around the time the Zynga/Hidden Agenda competition started, I started playing FarmVille for t3h research, and I've continued playing it, alongside FrontierVille, though I like the original FV much better -- it lags on my computer less, and I have more Friends who play it, which makes it slightly easier to obtain gifts and stuff.  Plus I guess I'm more into the whole pastoral ideal thing than <strike>manifest destiny</strike> the wild wild west.<br /><br />I've been trying desperately to work out why people hate social games so much and made the mistake of asking my Facebook network about it.  Given the fact that the intersection of Friends who are a) on the Internets and b) video game savvy are also c) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I7xHg7kmr0">intense about Smash</a>, I generally received snark and pointers to <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33059/Braids_Blow_Social_Games_Are_Not_Very_Social.php">interviews with Jonathan Blow</a>.<br /><br />But, anyway.  I guess the point is that I've been going over it back and forth without much conclusion.   To me, boiled down to their barest bones, FarmVille and WoW (more accepted in that group) are not so much different.  The mechanics encourage you to stick around in exchange for endorphins and the illusion (?) of productivity.  Click something, get something.  Millions of people just float happily in this broth every day.  Why get angry about it?<br /><br />That being said, I was (not completely) swayed to drop the class at the mention of ~*Social Games*~ like a couple other people were, though it would be a lie to say that I wasn't disappointed at all.  It's hard to think of new social games when things like Zynga and Bejeweled Blitz occupy so much of social game mindshare.  But I wracked my brain and when Andreas started talking about a cardgame called Heartbreak (the rules of which I cannot find online right now, as he described them to me) I decided to apply this to a board game and BAM.  GAME IDEA.<br /><br />PRESENTED IMPROMPTU IN FRONT OF THE CLASS THE NEXT DAY.<br /><br />EARNING NO INTERESTED CLASSMATES INITIALLY.<br /><br />THEN, TWO!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fs5lsvP0CnE/TZ6x_hiv1SI/AAAAAAAAAK8/IWF2FBnShA0/s1600/getacross.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="241" width="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fs5lsvP0CnE/TZ6x_hiv1SI/AAAAAAAAAK8/IWF2FBnShA0/s320/getacross.jpg" /></a></div><br />We've worked it out a little more and did the presentation pitch and I think we're actually off to a good start.  My half-hearted, half-hated social game idea is now something that I'm pretty excited about!  It's called <strong>Get Across</strong>.  The objective of the game is to get across a board, or "terrain," comprising obstacles such as mountains, monsters, bodies of water.  You can specialize in three classes, and "leveling up" grants you more ability cards.  It's essentially a collaborative online board game.<br /><br />I don't want to get my hopes too high, but it will be a success if I can have my Smash- and HoN-playing friends to play this game and enjoy it, play it and have that sort of heart-racing, "We're working together and beating everything!" feeling at least once. :x</div>
