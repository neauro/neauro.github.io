<strong>Tiled Photosets</strong><br />If you wanted to post more than one picture at a time on Tumblr, it used to be that the pictures would be placed into a little slideshow applet.  It was really elegant and cute; you would see one picture at a time, and could press a little rounded arrow to move on to the next picture.<br /><br />The problem is, no one would use it.  Or at least, if people did post this way, it didn&#8217;t get interacted with.  (At least, I didn&#8217;t, and the rare frequency with which I met up with a photoset on my dashboard makes me think that others didn&#8217;t really like this method of posting either.)  On Tumblr people just scroll, scroll, scroll.  Occasionally laugh.  And don&#8217;t stop for your dang photosets.<br /><br />Then, suddenly!  A tiled photoset appears!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CZrjAQAmsGI/TkCxzPGtDgI/AAAAAAAAAVg/78Ui_m8CiTk/s1600/photoset.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="526" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CZrjAQAmsGI/TkCxzPGtDgI/AAAAAAAAAVg/78Ui_m8CiTk/s640/photoset.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">with varied photo sizes, even!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />All of a sudden, you can see all the pictures in a photoset at once!  Plus the given layouts for different pictures make them all look really artsy, which Tumblr users love, because let&#8217;s be honest, over half of us are there just reblogging stuff.  Though another mark of how cool this feature is is how people have taken creative liberties with it, making sets of images like <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/8598587153/flashinglightsandecstasy-lol-xd">this</a>, or <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/8572474978">this</a>, or even <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/8436544789">this</a>.<br /><br />Making a feature which fits with how people actually use the product, and allows them to be creative?  ++!<br /><br /><br /><strong>Reblogging Tags</strong><br />I actually just noticed this today.  Never again will I have to repopulate the tags of something that I&#8217;m reblogging.  As an example, <a href="http://textless.tumblr.com/">textless.tumblr</a> is a great blog for macro photography of insects (and other animals), and the photographer always dutifully tags all of his posts with whatever is pictured.  <em>Wooly Aphid.  Larva.  Wasp Mimic. Secropia Silkmoth.</em>  (These tags often even get cut off in the dashboard post.  I can&#8217;t find an example now, but may later.)  In any case, though I love the accuracy of it, no way am I going to spend any time tagging these reblogs with anything more than &#8220;photo&#8221; and maybe &#8220;bug.&#8221;<br /><br />Fortunately, now tags also get reblogged!  So, now reblogging things can make you feel even more productive with even less energy. :)<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S_bvkOlgoOE/TkC4Lq-KX2I/AAAAAAAAAVo/bnrweSPmG8E/s1600/photoset2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="258" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S_bvkOlgoOE/TkC4Lq-KX2I/AAAAAAAAAVo/bnrweSPmG8E/s400/photoset2.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">thanks, tumblr. &nbsp;you the bomb</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><strong>Edit:</strong><br />Now if only tags were easier to remove than pressing that teensy little X beside every rounded-corner box.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oWzXOJfPEgI/TkNLEo_SODI/AAAAAAAAAV4/7vyWJbuxfDA/s1600/tumblr3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oWzXOJfPEgI/TkNLEo_SODI/AAAAAAAAAV4/7vyWJbuxfDA/s400/tumblr3.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Edit 2:</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This feature was eventually removed. I wonder why :(</div></div>

@jshou I was thinking about it!  I was thinking I could probably make a set of my favorites on Flickr and then randomly populate them everytime that page loads.</div>

I&#8217;ve always been more of a cat person, but recently I&#8217;ve been mad for shiba inu.  I found one in the FarmVille suite and it made my day.  I&#8217;m too shy to visit him all the time, but it&#8217;s enough to see him now and again.<br /><br />I found another shiba at the company meeting, and, typical of shiba aloofness with strangers, he did not care in the slightest that I adored him.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-74D_Hl1tbpk/Ti-wzOFiDcI/AAAAAAAAAUE/ZcMr3K-nsoc/s1600/DSC_0119%2B%25282%2529.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-74D_Hl1tbpk/Ti-wzOFiDcI/AAAAAAAAAUE/ZcMr3K-nsoc/s640/DSC_0119%2B%25282%2529.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh whoa i found a stick lol nom nom nom</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I cannot really explain why I started loving shiba inu with the abruptness and ferocity with which I did despite my general &#8220;:|&#8221; feeling about dogs, but it probably has something to do with this video, at least initially:<br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_uIshkpeXko" width="425"></iframe></center><br /><br />(More videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL957844FC81969564&amp;feature=mh_lolz">here</a>!)<br /><br />During breaks at work I&#8217;ve been searching for shiba inu-related stuff to read, and found <a href="http://juicybits.com/Shosha/_history.php">History and Tradition of the Japanese Shiba-Inu by Julia Cadwell</a>.  It goes,<br /><br /><blockquote>Today’s Shiba has been bred by careful mixing of many strains of small Japanese dogs.</blockquote><br />And then,<br /><br /><blockquote>The first impression the Japanese Shiba Dog creates is a lack of sophistication—a touch of nature that has escaped human forced breeding. Actually the Japanese Shiba Dog has escaped much artificiality that accompanies improvement and fixation of species.</blockquote><br /><em>lol wat</em><br /><br />In other news, this idea of shiba inu being attractive because they are in part so wild and &#8220;not completely obedient&#8221; reminds me intensely of tea ceremony aestheticism, of the beauty it finds in odd numbers, in asymmetrical and lumpy pottery, in things that are perfect because of their imperfection.<br /><br />Finding a job and then finding a shibanakama are some of the reasons why I am excited to return home. :3</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;ve done a lot of exploring in San Francisco this past weekend, as my more city-savvy friends have returned from Japan.  One of them lamented having not known about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format">raws</a> before going, and we had a conversation about it, with me mostly being like, <em>Dude, raw may make your pictures better but so does having the proper aperture, shutter speed, white balance, ISO,</em> etc.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve only tried shooting raw once, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=11378171@N02&amp;q=%22golden%20gardens%22">with somewhat non-exceptional results</a>.  The only thing that came out of this experience was that raws took forever to edit (on my poor, slow computer) and I didn&#8217;t really see much difference in quality.<br /><br />Fast forward to exploration weekend, wherein I decided I would give raws another shot (if you will) and then realized that <em>they are really cool</em>.  There are <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/u-raw-files.shtml">other places</a> where you can learn exactly what raws are, so I won&#8217;t go into that here, but rather just talk about my experiences.<br /><br />What I found really amazing about the raw images that I took was the capacity that I had to edit them.  With my normal fine jpegs, I pretty much just threw them into Photoshop, and adjusted the middle bar of Levels slightly to the right to get rid of some of the grays.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hQG8cREC90M/Ti5OEXhbfvI/AAAAAAAAATE/b3uwemzEG4g/s1600/lessgraylol.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="198" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hQG8cREC90M/Ti5OEXhbfvI/AAAAAAAAATE/b3uwemzEG4g/s320/lessgraylol.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">now it&#8217;s less gray lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And that was about the extent of my editing, unless I was trying to fix white balance or whatever.  Occasionally I would touch the other two bars, but pictures would inevitably look way too bright or way too dark afterward.

Or else make everything around it as black as my soul.  Though I have to admit that a likely cause of this is just the fact that using Photoshop tools is like reaching for something in a huge, bubbling cauldron and slapping it on your picture &#8211; you don&#8217;t really know what you&#8217;re doing and you&#8217;re never really quite sure what will happen.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dtsf4qr3b74/Ti5RtKqc6dI/AAAAAAAAATs/Mg_gfs-UtA0/s1600/lolol.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dtsf4qr3b74/Ti5RtKqc6dI/AAAAAAAAATs/Mg_gfs-UtA0/s320/lolol.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">what wait oh no why</td></tr></tbody></table><br />On the other hand, the workflow for editing a raw in the Mac that I&#8217;m borrowing is pretty self-explanatory.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HDutWQ33XJ4/Ti5T4iYqylI/AAAAAAAAAT8/eQy32YMjnrI/s1600/cameraraw.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="211" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HDutWQ33XJ4/Ti5T4iYqylI/AAAAAAAAAT8/eQy32YMjnrI/s320/cameraraw.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh, so those are the things i can do?<br />and i can see what changes they make to the picture immediately?<br />okay.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Anyway.  My notable observations on raw are as follows:<br /><br /><ul><li>Raw files take up too much dang space. &nbsp;My 4GB memory card can handle 1,500+ fine JPEGs like a badass. &nbsp;It can hold about 400 raws.</li><li>This means that my normal methods of &#8220;TAKE AS MANY PICTURES AS YOU CAN AND MAYBE THREE OF THEM WILL BE OKAY&#8221; won&#8217;t work here.</li><li>Then again, the reason why I had to take so many pictures was because so many of them turned out irreversibly poor. &nbsp;And if I could <i>edit </i>them&#8230;</li><li>Even though it sucks to have less space, I don&#8217;t actually mind it &#8211; throughout this past weekend I found myself being more thoughtful about what pictures to take, and being more vicious about which ones to immediately delete if I didn&#8217;t like them. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not just memory that I need to take into account &#8211; it&#8217;s the fact that every picture I save will require some minutes of editing, which, in my busy busy day is worth &nbsp; a ton. &nbsp;I&#8217;m already two days behind in my&nbsp;<a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/30_day_challenge">San Francisco Summer thing</a>&nbsp;I&#8217;m trying to do.</li><li>Being more thoughtful in the actual picture-taking process is, to me, a refreshing change.</li><li>Plus, in the actual editing I really feel more connected and appreciative of each picture, and thus more like I&#8217;ve actually accomplished something meaningful for myself, etc.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>That being said, aside from pictures which will be explicitly harvested for panorama purposes, I think I&#8217;m going to do my best to stick to raw file formats as a default from now on, the same way that I moved somewhat mysteriously from always-auto to always-manual settings. &nbsp;Still, I think it&#8217;s important to have a handle on aperture/shutter speed/ISO and all that, since a raw file format can&#8217;t fix blur. &nbsp;(That I know of.) &nbsp;And you know me, I&#8217;m liek totally super pro photog, so listen up.</div></div>

It was a pretty interesting ride, around 3 and a half hours by BART and bus from San Francisco to Antioch, though most of it was waiting for the buses on a Sunday, when transportation in general is sparse.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O4qVxi104B0/TiU5_GGVllI/AAAAAAAAAS8/8cyoXf1Q4D4/s1600/DSC_0158.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O4qVxi104B0/TiU5_GGVllI/AAAAAAAAAS8/8cyoXf1Q4D4/s640/DSC_0158.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">moar teams</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It&#8217;s fun to be in a place where people are so passionate about a game that was released <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Brothers_Melee">almost 10 years ago</a>.  I spent the winter of sophomore year rabidly playing this game, trying to perfect my Pikachu and never quite getting the hang of wavedashing.  Andou taught me about all the big names in Smash and I even got to see Axe, who I don&#8217;t really know or follow but admire because his Pikachu is really good.  I attempted to figure out why, and it seems that fairs and dairs are bad with Pikachu?  Who knew.  They were so satisfying in the first Smash Brothers. :x<br /><br />The only thing that dimmed me a bit is the fact that the group that organizes Genesis is called &#8220;DBR,&#8221; which one of my friends admitted to me stands for &#8220;Death By Rape.&#8221;<br /><br />~___~<br /><br />&#8220;They&#8217;re really nice people,&#8221; Andou told me, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s true &#8211; the tournament is well-attended and well-beloved, it seems that relatives staffed the counter where they sold food and people were shaken and concerned when it turned out a fellow Smasher had been robbed at gunpoint one night.  It&#8217;s just sad that a word that stands for so much violence and pain has become so normalized in this community.  Walk by any television and it&#8217;s a litany of, &#8221;<em>SUCK HIS DICK!

My friend admitted that, despite his general lack of sensitivity to on-screen violence, the repeated rape scenes in Dexter made him squeamish, but when I asked about what he felt about the casual use of &#8220;rape&#8221; in games he pretty much shrugged it off.  It&#8217;s normal usage.  It&#8217;s not really thought of in <em>that way</em>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-om35AtlMmAY/TiUwzDP4HbI/AAAAAAAAASk/UJwt5liOFzE/s1600/tumblr_lokfhpSnl81qdycalo3_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-om35AtlMmAY/TiUwzDP4HbI/AAAAAAAAASk/UJwt5liOFzE/s640/tumblr_lokfhpSnl81qdycalo3_1280.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">he just got raped, dude.  that&#8217;s all</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I guess it&#8217;s nice to be able to just shrug off and trivialize <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2011/jul/15/democratic-congo-male-rape">traumatic injustices</a>.  It pains me that a group filled with genuinely nice people would work under such a name.  <em>Death By Being Physically Violated Until the Last Breath Leaves Your Body.</em><br /><br />I was discussing potential alternatives with Andou and this one is my favorite.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GgGFJxkoyZ0/TiU4uzUm--I/AAAAAAAAASs/CfkYfO5Z6iQ/s1600/dbr.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GgGFJxkoyZ0/TiU4uzUm--I/AAAAAAAAASs/CfkYfO5Z6iQ/s320/dbr.png" width="297" /></a></div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
San Francisco has been great!  I&#8217;ve been spending most of the time trying to get acclimated to my work environment/coworkers, as well as to the passersby here, who all say &#8220;Hi&#8221; at the last possible moment.  I end up turning around hastily and yelling &#8220;Hi!&#8221; to their backs.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve come to an uncomfortable point in my life where I have so many Web 2.0 things that I have no idea what to update, when I feel like updating something.  Most of my SF adventures are detailed on <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/one_new_sf_thing_every_day">my Tumblr</a>, where I strive to do &#8220;one new thing a day.&#8221; My reasoning for not putting that sort of stuff here is that, the stuff I put on Tumblr is more personal?  And I would prefer to reserve this blog for stuff of more professional nature, i.e. learning about programming?  There&#8217;s also a different flavor to how things get shared on Tumblr that I&#8217;m mindful of, for example, if I&#8217;m uploading pictures, all the ones of dessert go to Tumblr, whereas all my super-nicer ones (even if they include family) all go to Flickr, and everything may go indiscriminately to Facebook, etc.<br /><br />I guess on the topic of learning new things, I&#8217;ve been trying to revamp my portfolio website, but been having fun just changing things here and there, searching for the right layout.  I&#8217;m trying to learn Sinatra and it&#8217;s going well, but since my Dreamhost account doesn&#8217;t really support Rails, I may have to do the site in PHP anyway if I want to get it up faster, and try using Heroku if I&#8217;d be okay with getting it up later.</div>

When I was younger games like Sonic the Hedgehog or Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse were fine, but nowadays I really crave story, for a game to make me think something new.  Games are too expensive to risk going beyond gunsight and realistic blood nowadays, I suppose.</div>
