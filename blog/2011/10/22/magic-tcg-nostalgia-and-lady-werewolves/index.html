<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Two weekends ago, I did what I said I would never do.<br /><br />I bought a box of Magic: The Gathering cards.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Am5D7PU8S4M/TqNJRm0wFcI/AAAAAAAAAe4/z5RkvDWsx0c/s1600/IMG_0086%255B1%255D.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Am5D7PU8S4M/TqNJRm0wFcI/AAAAAAAAAe4/z5RkvDWsx0c/s320/IMG_0086%255B1%255D.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">faux depth-of-field courtesy of<a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Back in the day I was unreasonably obsessed with the Pokemon TCG.  To this day I remember a couple of my more memorable trades in Latchkey &#8211; a Dewgong and a Machoke for a Clefairy, a Zapdos for a first edition Base Charizard (then around $120, now about $300 or so, though I&#8217;d invite you to see that <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/Pokemon-/2610/i.html?_nkw=1st+edition+charizard">the offers I referenced don&#8217;t actually have any bids on them</a>, haha).  I used to go to Toys R US on Saturdays to participate in the Pokemon League Thing, where a lot of people gathered to fight each other.  I had a Psychic/Normal deck (because Psychic types were only weak to Psychic types, and because Normal types had a natural resistance to the Psychic types my Psychic Pokemon would be weak to, and because I didn&#8217;t have enough of any other Energy type with which to build a deck with).<br /><br />My most memorable battle is one that I waged against this much-older woman.  We both had one prize left.  She had an 80 HP Dragonair with 50 damage and had just knocked out one of my Pokemon.  I had a 50 HP Mew left, and with trepidation I placed it into battle position, or whatever that position is called where your Pokemon is placed when it is now ready to face off.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YHAhLwIyR7s/TqNkCn4lKuI/AAAAAAAAAfE/-67m2dvudTk/s1600/PZOP0075_500.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YHAhLwIyR7s/TqNkCn4lKuI/AAAAAAAAAfE/-67m2dvudTk/s320/PZOP0075_500.jpeg" width="230" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Mew (<a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/showthread.php?t=127345&amp;page=40">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I attached a Psychic energy to my Mew and with a small voice said, &#8220;I use Devolution Beam.&#8221;<br /><br />The woman shrugged.  &#8220;Alright.&#8221; She put the Dragonair back in her hand.  We stared at each other.  Finally I told her, &#8220;You&#8217;re dead.&#8221;<br /><br />Her devolved Dragonair had become a 40 HP Dratini with 50 points of damage on it.<br /><br />We shook hands.  Mine was shaking from the trauma of triumphing over a stranger so much older, and I don&#8217;t remember any battle after that one, though this is less because of fear and more because my father was tired of bringing me and my friends to Toys R Us on weekends and also remarked that Pokemon were a waste of money.  I looked down at the Typhlosion I had just gotten and realized, <em>Yeah.  This is kind of a waste of money</em>.<br /><br />Fast-forward to the present, where I realize Magic&#8217;s newest set, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innistrad">Innistrad</a>, features <em>werewolves</em>.  I <em>love</em> werewolves.  In the past I have not played Magic as much as I have admired and hungered over the art and flavor text of the cards.  I love how Magic creates its own narrative and fiction &#8211; when reading the cards&#8217; stories and abilities you can totally <em>feel</em> the power and coolness of each character, you can see yourself as mighty planeswalker summoning beings to wage battle, you can see this strange, dark dystopian country filled with girls that walk the night alone and turn into monsters when confronted by predators.  I&#8217;ve always just confined myself to just watching games and reading from the sidelines, but if Magic is going to have werewolves, well, shoot.  I&#8217;m not 11 years old anymore.  I have a job!<br /><br />And a healthy sense of beginner&#8217;s luck.  Every pack in Innistrad contains a rare card (either rare or the rarer &#8220;mythic rare&#8221;), as well as a shapeshifting card (either common, uncommon, or rare), and a potential holographic extra card (which itself can be common, uncommon, or rare/mythic rare).  In one pack I managed to score THREE RARES.  That&#8217;s the usual rare, a rare shapeshifter, and a holographic rare Stormkirk Noble.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x6U41JAUu-4/TqNsunj_TUI/AAAAAAAAAfc/uvyuGoahLuM/s1600/IMG_0087%255B1%255D.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x6U41JAUu-4/TqNsunj_TUI/AAAAAAAAAfc/uvyuGoahLuM/s320/IMG_0087%255B1%255D.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so beautiful. and blurry</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also got a card which depicted what I first described with delight as an Asian mage, until Andou heard me and exclaimed, &#8220;A <em>SNAPCASTER MAGE</em>?&#8221; Apparently this is one of the more valued cards of the set due to its Flash ability as well as its ability to allow its player to cast spells from the graveyard.  Since it is blue and I am primarily interested in red/green werewolves, it was mildly less exciting to receive, but hey!  It&#8217;s an Asian-looking mage.<br /><br />On a similar note, another thing that I like about the werewolves of Innistrad is that there are some female ones like <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=222111">Reckless Waif</a> and <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=222118">Daybreak Ranger</a> which have cool costumes not as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_gaze#The_Male_Gaze_and_feminist_theory">male gaze</a>-y as, say, <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230779">Crossway Vampire</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3TLuLmL8oug/TqNxvNZsRZI/AAAAAAAAAf0/h_ixxd_n6zk/s1600/reckless%2Bwaif.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="222" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3TLuLmL8oug/TqNxvNZsRZI/AAAAAAAAAf0/h_ixxd_n6zk/s320/reckless%2Bwaif.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Reckless Waif (<a href="http://www.blackborder.com/q/node/13241">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UqvV6PJlK2M/TqN4LWjd_-I/AAAAAAAAAgM/Q6pvPNlIPiw/s1600/5l0fgfboyl_en.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UqvV6PJlK2M/TqN4LWjd_-I/AAAAAAAAAgM/Q6pvPNlIPiw/s320/5l0fgfboyl_en.jpg" width="229" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Crossway Vampire (<a href="http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75842/28283735/ISD-ICD_Crossway_Vampire">source</a>, plus some bonus boob-filled discussion for your perusal)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also welcome the fact that these women, if a player does not cast a spell on their turn, then proceed during upkeep stage to turn into huge, powerful, vicious creatures that can&#8217;t be considered conventionally attractive in the same way the Undead women of WOW are.  I only compare them because I would expect a race like &#8220;Undead&#8221; to be, like werewolves, kind of horrific, or at least a little more horrific than their present depiction. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U7f0kUj-GyE/TqN1bL985EI/AAAAAAAAAgA/rv9PnbUzXCY/s1600/6a00d834515f7269e200e54f1659bd8834-640wi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U7f0kUj-GyE/TqN1bL985EI/AAAAAAAAAgA/rv9PnbUzXCY/s320/6a00d834515f7269e200e54f1659bd8834-640wi.jpg" width="319" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">yeah, i do consider big boobs, a thin figure, and full lips to be conventionally attractive (<a href="http://www.wonderlandblog.com/wonderland/2007/02/women_of_wow.html">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This reminds me that the first time that I visited our local card store and confessed to the proprietor that I wished to purchase a box of cards, he said, &#8221;<em>Why</em>?&#8221;<br /><br />His tone of voice was almost accusatory.  I&#8217;m not really an aggro type of person so I stammered with pseudo-wit, &#8220;Because &#8211; I &#8211; want to have fun &#8211;&#8221; and he waved me off with an explanation that he was joking.  He then asked Andou if he was teaching me how to play.<br /><br />Just a microaggression.  After all, he was just joking, right?  And my boyfriend <em>was</em> teaching me how to play right?  And girls <em>are</em> pretty rare in this scene, right?  Like, probably mythic rare.<br /><br />I guess I just like the idea that I should be able to go somewhere and spend $98 on cardboard without anyone having to tie my interests to a nearby boy.  And I also like the idea that people playing with these fancy cardboards should be able to see women on them whose appearance is not always tied to seduction of men.<br /><br />For now I give Local Card Store the benefit of the doubt, since the proprietor kindly let me choose which Innistrad box I wanted, and it turned out to be so filled with wonderful things, and also let me know about Friday night Magic gatherings which I may visit sometime if I can get over my general shyness about battling strangers, and also master the basics.  Last weekend, Andou and I went back to grab another Innistrad box, and this time the first booster that I opened had a <em>Liliana of the Veil.  Omg.  <a href="http://www.toywiz.com/mtginnistradlilianaoftheveil.html">What.</a></em><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kKMewAoNUOw/TqNsiQIS9GI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/AX313FQrg3Q/s1600/IMG_0091%255B1%255D.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kKMewAoNUOw/TqNsiQIS9GI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/AX313FQrg3Q/s320/IMG_0091%255B1%255D.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">36 Christmas presents</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It also contained another Snapcaster Mage and the true treasure, a holographic Kruin Outlaw for my werewolf deck.  This past weekend I put all my werewolves in red sleeves and put them in their own deckbox and then took them to work, which was kind of a silly move on my part because I don&#8217;t actually have anyone there to play with.  I feel like a dog with a stick and no one to play tug with.</div>
