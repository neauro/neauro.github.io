<div class="entry-content"><p>Well! It&rsquo;s over.</p>

<p>I download <em>Allegiant</em> from the Seattle Public Library&rsquo;s eBook collection as soon as it became available, and read it over the course of a couple days, despite the looming presence of NaNoWriMo (which I&rsquo;ve been keeping track of in <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/nnwm2013">my Tumblr</a>).</p>

<p>[spoilers ahead]</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t have much to say about it. The writing wasn&rsquo;t that interesting. There are a smattering of issues that other reviews have already discussed — such as how Tris and Four&rsquo;s voices were barely distinguishable from each other, something especially tough to deal with when reading on a Kindle. In some places <em>Allegiant</em> felt repetitive. Tris was repeatedly described as either &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;pale,&rdquo; and it felt like eyes carried many of the discussions in this book. (Though I admit I&rsquo;m not overly fond in the first place of eyes described as communicating incredibly detailed emotions.)</p>

<blockquote>Now she looks pale and small, but her eyes make me think of wide-open skies that I have never actually seen, only dreamed of.</blockquote>




<blockquote>There is a wavering expression in her eyes, like she is a heap of leaves about to be scattered by the wind.</blockquote>




<blockquote>He has kept his eyes averted since I sat in the chair and they cut the strip of plastic binding my wrists together. For just for a moment, his eyes touch mine, and I know it’s time to start lying.</blockquote>




<blockquote>Her fingers are on his throat, taking his pulse, and her eyes are wide and empty. […] Her dark eyes are wide with fear as she says, “Are you hurt?”</blockquote>




<blockquote>She looks up at me, her eyes clear and eager.</blockquote>




<blockquote>She smiles, but her eyes are glassy, like a dormant part of her is fighting its way out and spilling over.</blockquote>


<p>I wasn&rsquo;t too interested in the big reveal of genetic tampering. Because it was just barely related to any events or concepts introduced in earlier books, it felt totally out of the blue. I could force a connection if I tried hard enough — maybe all the genetic stuff plays into the significance in earlier books about how &ldquo;one choice can define you&rdquo; —  but ultimately the genetic experiments felt unpleasantly disconnected and abrupt. Reveals are exciting and fun when you anticipate them, when you look back and realize that all the signs pointed toward them; not when they just slap you in the face under the guise of being totally mind-blowing.</p>

<p>I was also disappointed that two of the more obvious characters of color — Tori Wu, and Uriah — were killed off. Uriah&rsquo;s death acted solely as a catalyst for more of Four&rsquo;s angst, which he had enough of already, between worrying about his parents and worrying about his genetic purity. Tori&rsquo;s death accomplished nothing but the sorrow of a secondary character I hardly knew. Their deaths felt like a lazy way to get a rise out of the reader by taking away characters that had always been &ldquo;good people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the way that I feel about Tris&rsquo;s death as well. Her final reason for sacrificing herself wasn&rsquo;t related to anything else that she desired so desperately in the book: for her community to not die, for her to be with Four. I do like the twist in her character — how she first chose Dauntless, and then, in the end, chose again to be selfless Abegnation — but because I didn&rsquo;t see how it fit into an overall theme for the third book, this too felt like a cheap way to get me to have emotions about what was going on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried a couple times now to explain more about why the ending of Allegiant was so disappointing to me, but I&rsquo;ve found <a href="http://myallegiantreview.blogspot.com/2013/11/breaking-down-ending-to-allegiant.html">this blog post</a> that has already done all of the (super comprehensive) work.</p>

<p>The fact that this ending has, for many readers, &ldquo;ruined the entire series&rdquo; also reminds me of <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_kahneman_the_riddle_of_experience_vs_memory.html">this TED Talk</a>, in which the speaker talks about how the end of an experience can ruin the entire thing.</p>

<blockquote>But now there is another question: &#8220;How much did these patients think they suffered?&#8221; And here is a surprise. The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B. The stories of the colonoscopies were different, and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great &#8211; but one of them is this distinct &#8230; (Laughter) but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end; it&#8217;s a bad story. How do we know that? Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy, and much later, too, &#8220;How bad was the whole thing, in total?&#8221; And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.</blockquote>
