<h4 class="ls1">Hello!</h4>
<p>
I'm Nadine. I'm a designer experienced with owning UX design and UX research techniques to explore and bring ideas from early concept to finished, validated feature.  
</p>
<p>I graduated from the University of Washington (B.S. Computer Science, M.S. Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering).</p>

<p>
I design, write, code, take pictures, draw, play with and show my dog, study languages, and enjoy some other things too. I read a lot (recently, Charles Yu's <em>Interior Chinatown</em> and the entire <em>Animorphs</em> series).
</p>

<p>
I also love video games (recently, <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, though I'm extremely very looking forward to the next Splatoon!!!).
</p>

<p>
  In general, I enjoy buildings things that are not just fun, but do good by providing a service for people in their everyday lives.
