  Reveal Chat was a startup dedicated to “curing loneliness.”
</h4>
<p>
  I was one of the first employees, and implemented user-facing features for desktop/mobile web using Ruby on Rails, HAML, HTML, CSS/SCSS, and jQuery.
</p>
    
<p>
  I also performed usability/customer development tests, sketched user flows, and iterated on features to improve UX and product growth on web/iOS. I ran various lightweight, “cheap” experiments to improve growth and validated features with user data.

  In under nine months, Reveal Chat scaled from 10,000 users to over two million users. In 2015, Reveal Chat was acquired by Rhapsody International (now Napster).
