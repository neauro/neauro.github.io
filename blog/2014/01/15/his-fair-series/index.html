<blockquote>Seventeen-year-old Ismae escapes from the brutality of an arranged marriage into the sanctuary of the convent of St. Mortain, where the sisters still serve the gods of old. Here she learns that the god of Death Himself has blessed her with dangerous gifts—and a violent destiny. If she chooses to stay at the convent, she will be trained as an assassin and serve as a handmaiden to Death. To claim her new life, she must destroy the lives of others.
<br/><br/>

Ismae’s most important assignment takes her straight into the high court of Brittany—where she finds herself woefully under prepared—not only for the deadly games of intrigue and treason, but for the impossible choices she must make. For how can she deliver Death’s vengeance upon a target who, against her will, has stolen her heart?

— Grave Mercy</blockquote>




<blockquote>
When Sybella arrived at the doorstep of St Mortain half mad with grief and despair the convent were only too happy to offer her refuge - but at a price. The sisters of this convent serve Death, and with Sybella naturally skilled in both the arts of death and seduction, she could become one of their most dangerous weapons.
<br/><br/>
But her assassin&#8217;s skills are little comfort when the convent returns her to the life that nearly drove her mad. Her father&#8217;s rage and brutality are terrifying, and her brother&#8217;s love is equally monstrous. But when Sybella discovers an unexpected ally she discovers that a daughter of Death may find something other than vengeance to live for&#8230;
<Br/><br/> 
— Dark Triumph</blockquote>


<p>A coworker lent me <em>Grave Mercy</em> and <em>Dark Triumph</em>, the books currently released in the <em>His Fair Assassin</em> trilogy, and I devoured them both in less than a week. They were delicious.</p>

<p>The books are set in Brittany, at a time when it is fighting for its independence against the French. There&rsquo;s a lot of political intrigue, and, as Goodreads is fond of saying, &ldquo;magical assassin nuns,&rdquo; who are the main characters of the books. Overall, they&rsquo;re fun characters to read about, poisons and daggers and conflicts and struggles all. They navigate politics, relationships, and their own identities and duties.</p>

<p>(TW) As a warning, these books contain a lot of sexual assault, especially the second book, whose protagonist, Sybella, is a survivor. Whereas sexual assault in stories is something I often eyeroll at due to its prevalent use as a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toa_vH6xGqs">grimdark fridging mechanism</a>, the use of sexual assault in <em>His Fair Assassin</em> wasn&rsquo;t trivialized, dramaticized, or used to further the motivations of another character. Sexual assault is a horrible act, and when victim-blaming occurs it is struck down as wrong. Both books explore women making choices about their sexuality, with consenting, supportive partners.</p>

<p>(It seems weird to even write the above paragraph. Like, shouldn&rsquo;t this just be <em>the way it is</em>? It seems strange to praise a book so highly for meeting what should be common guidlines for decency. Anyway. <em>His Fair Assassin</em> nails it.)</p>

<p>Something that I felt these books were lacking were that they took for granted my knowledge of European history. For example, why is Brittany rebelling against France? I wonder if Brittany&rsquo;s rebellion is just something that Everyone is aware of already; even so, it would have been nice to have in-book examples of why a French takeover would be so bad. It would&rsquo;ve also been nice to see more reasons why everyone was so willing to devote their lives to a twelve-year-old duchess. That everyone was unerringly adoring of her and willing to die for her sake was strange to me, and descriptions of her being &ldquo;wiser than her years&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t quite stand up on its own as a reason to rally behind her, especially when the world is so patriarchal.</p>

<p>This series was one of the rare cases where I loved the second book more than the first. The protagonist of the third book, Annith, has been introduced thus far as a predictably innocent character, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to where LaFevers will take her.</p>
