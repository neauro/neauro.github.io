<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BnoNmU79S3s/Te6fCLq8juI/AAAAAAAAAPs/51hqo7V6sBs/s1600/Getacross.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BnoNmU79S3s/Te6fCLq8juI/AAAAAAAAAPs/51hqo7V6sBs/s320/Getacross.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Yesterday was our last presentation for Games Capstone.  All in all, it was a pretty good quarter -- I've learned a lot about clientside and serverside game programming using Flixel and Player.IO, as well as how to solve (or even better, avoid dealing with) some of the most annoying problems.<br /><br />You can check <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/instr/cse481d/11sp/games/#">Get Across on Facebook</a>, and see <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/instr/cse481d/11sp/games/#">the other social games</a> on this webpage.<br /><br />First,<br /><br /><h2>An Overview</h2>Get Across is a multiplayer game with tile-based movement.  The objective is to get across (whoa!) a sort of terrain, where different parts of the terrain take more energy to get across, i.e. getting across a mountain takes more energy than getting across a hill, which in turn takes more energy than getting across normal flat ground.  The player can be one of several classes, and each class has its own special abilities: Crafters can get across water by building bridges, Planters can reduce energy usage, Cooks can replenish AP or lure monsters away with Monster Bacon, etc.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QPmFnAiZ3_g/Te-5WmWhIII/AAAAAAAAAQE/fC89efc8d5s/s1600/tutorial1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QPmFnAiZ3_g/Te-5WmWhIII/AAAAAAAAAQE/fC89efc8d5s/s320/tutorial1.jpg" width="319" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">terrain of the first tutorial</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The idea is that you and your friends could work together to solve boards, and be scored on things such as how long it took you to solve the board together, how much energy and other resources you used, etc.  There could be leaderboards for different teams, and you could also make boards on your own and have your friends "conquer" them.  Each terrain would be kind of like a puzzle that you would be able to solve in different ways, given your different abilities, and different "cards" that you could take into the level, which would have special effects like making mountains explode, or allow players to switch positions with each other, etc.  Like a board game.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Implementation</h2>We -- Ji, Charlie, and myself -- used Flixel, as well as Player.IO for the multiplayer stuff and saving players and states to the database.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Problems</h2>One of them was our thread abortion problem, which arose out of the blue at some point and refused to leave.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oy4_dhDXsrM/Te6gZkim6YI/AAAAAAAAAP0/oMnhzpEFDh8/s1600/the%2Berror%2Bi%2Bhate.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oy4_dhDXsrM/Te6gZkim6YI/AAAAAAAAAP0/oMnhzpEFDh8/s320/the%2Berror%2Bi%2Bhate.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i hate you more than i hate shrimp and scallops</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Eventually, we found <a href="http://playerio.com/forum/multiplayer/cpu-runtime-thread-aborts-t1620">this thread</a> on the Player.IO forums which was made pretty much the day that we started having this problem unbearably, like 90% of the time we started running the game.  I am 90% sure that all of our thread abortions were the cause of the error discussed by Oliver:<br /><br /><blockquote>That error precisely means that one thread was caught using too much cpu, and that it was aborted as a consequence. <strong>We have to ensure that all events are handled swiftly (&lt;100ms), otherwise the server will perform really badly.</strong> I've specified earlier how our new measuring system works: first it uses global time, and then it switches over to thread-specific time, so the other load on the machine *shouldn't* make a difference... unless of course it's very high load, in which case all bets are off."</blockquote><br />Every player was saved in a "Quest" object, which contained that player's position on the board, their AP, the amount of resources they had, as well as the state of the board, tiles and monsters and so forth.  Some of these were stored in DatabaseArrays, and some of them were DatabaseObjects in DatabaseArrays...<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QK1LUANMpos/Te6ky6yvolI/AAAAAAAAAxU/EGUMEZ3DhKU/s1600/questobject.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="125" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QK1LUANMpos/Te6ky6yvolI/AAAAAAAAAxU/EGUMEZ3DhKU/s200/questobject.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so much embedded</td></tr></tbody></table><br />One unforeseen problem with the arrays was this weird <a href="http://playerio.com/forum/bigdb-f32/cannot-create-circular-references-inside-database-objects-t1630">circular references error</a>, which happens if you try to create a new object, and then set an array in that object to be the same as another object's array.  Due to some weirdness, in order to copy an array over, right now the accepted workaround seems to be to just copy that array element by element... :/ Which could have contributed to our 100+ ms.  To change this array structure completely would have taken more time than we had, especially since we had already implemented most of the game, but I imagine we could have maybe substituted some of the objects for strings.  For instance, every monster on the board was a DatabaseObject containing an x-position, a y-position, a "type" (either weak or strong), and a health variable; instead this could have just been a coded String.<br /><br />Anyway -- leaving Get Across now, I'm left with a lot of Lessons Learned.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Paper Prototyping and Testing is Essential</h2>The first month or so of our Capstone class was just paper prototyping and testing, which I feel was met with a lot of skepticism on our part.  Paper prototyping for Get Across was pretty easy (if tedious): we just had a grid, and a couple other paper bits to represent mountains, rivers, hills, etc., which we rearranged as necessary.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V4fBD--t-mA/Te6tbnCe-II/AAAAAAAAAP8/KxqyTZKPVhQ/s1600/paper%2Bprototype.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V4fBD--t-mA/Te6tbnCe-II/AAAAAAAAAP8/KxqyTZKPVhQ/s320/paper%2Bprototype.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">paper protyping get across</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Paper prototyping was also a theme of the HCI class that I took this quarter, for obvious reasons: the more you start building something, the harder it is to change.  Paper prototyping helped us learn early which mechanics would work and which wouldn't.  For example, one "social" aspect of the game would make it so that, of two players playing a map, one player would have to sit on a button and wait for the other player to go through the gate the button opened; but we learned early on that, especially in an asynchronous game, this is an...inadequate idea.  When someone logs onto a game, they want to be able to do something; if they're just sitting and waiting for someone to move, unable to force them to do so, then it's regarded as a waste of time.  We eventually made it so that buttons only had to be pressed once for a gate to open permanently, which isn't novel, but what we were limited to in time this quarter.<br /><br />Paper prototyping was hard to use for some aspects of our game, however -- for instance, we were thinking that we could use a CityVille-like usage of energy which would come back in time, and in play-testing sessions, since we replenished AP instantly when people lost it, people just didn't feel like their AP was rare enough to save.  In retrospect, we could have just made it so that people would wait like 10 seconds or something when they ran out of AP.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Testing and More Testing and More Testing is Also Essential</h2>There were some days when we came to class having a shambled, three-legged version of a game, and it was on those days especially that I didn't want to let <em>anyone</em> see the game; but even if all of our functionality wasn't implemented yet, we were still able to discover a lot of interesting things that we just wouldn't have had the insight to realize on our own.  Here is a sample of the (very long) list of things we gathered during one playtest last month:<br /><ul><li>people will start moving with the mouse before the arrow keys</li><li>people don't notice AP diminishing</li><li>"toggle on and off the bridge is a little confusing" -- when bridge is selected, instead of putting the yellow square, put an overlay of the bridge?  also, turn off the bridge ability once a bridge is made</li><li>frustrating to wait for AP to come back when you've lost it</li><li>how many clicks do people use to go through the menu, and as they play?  try and minimize number of clicks</li><li>and so on</li></ul><br /><br /><h2>Having a Schedule Would Have Probably Made Our Lives Easier</h2>The way that we worked on Get Across was a little haphazardly -- we pushed out the features that we wanted to, versus the ones we probably should have worked on, which made it so that our Facebook integration was close to nothing.  Which brings me to the next point:<br /><br /><br /><h2>If It's Supposed to be a Facebook Game, Build It on Facebook From the Very Beginning!</h2>It seems obvious, but this particular Capstone advised this course very strongly: release on Newgrounds, then on Kongregate (which has a larger populace), then on Facebook.  In the end, we only did Kongregate and Facebook (since Player.IO supports these two, and not Newgrounds), but not focusing on Facebook integration from the very beginning (allowing you to see your friends, or to send invitations to them immediately) made Get Across's Facebook release very weak.<br /><br /><br /><br />And those are the writing-worthy ones that I can think of.  Simple, yet effective lessons.  In the end, working with Player.IO was fun and it definitely served its purpose, and the only thing keeping it from working perfectly for us was the learning curve.<br /><br />Knowing slightly more than I did before this game, and tons more than I know than when I worked with Jimmy and Leilani to put together <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/02/game-bonding-time.html">Bonding Time</a>, I am really excited to start my next game project. :D Just gotta think about what it will be.</div>

Not so hard, as Charlie had already implemented the store-type setup, and I really just needed to change a couple variables here and there and add the right checks to make sure the avatars loaded properly.  The hardest thing was testing each little avatar and making sure that the frames were all separated -- if the images on the frames are too close together, then you can see bits of them leaking onto other frames of an animation.  There's probably a smarter way to figure out where the delineation is in Flixel sprite animations, but I haven't been able to find it yet.<br /><br />Hopefully this will make our Facebook release even just a little bit more fun/appealing.  FB release will happen at the latest this Thursday, if another team-member hasn't already pushed it.  Player.IO was apparently pretty easy to hook up to Facebook if you subscribe to Sitebox, which is a relief; I'm planning to get more details later on how exactly Charlie did it.</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FS01GyXZtMU/TdtOqq5GybI/AAAAAAAAAOM/KqG4OmKmecU/s1600/kongregate_users.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="197" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FS01GyXZtMU/TdtOqq5GybI/AAAAAAAAAOM/KqG4OmKmecU/s320/kongregate_users.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the first 200-some players of our silly capstone game</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It's been about 24 hours since <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/getAcross/get-across">our first online release of Get Across</a>.  Our capstone class recommends moving from Newgrounds, to Kongregate, but then to Facebook, but it's taken us such a long time to learn Player.IO that we skipped straight to Kongregate, as <a href="http://playerio.com/documentation/quickconnect/kongregate">Player.IO already supports this.</a>.<br /><br />Still, our release was (to me) a little rushed, and I would have loved nothing better than to clutch the game even tighter and keep anyone from seeing it at all.  We have presentations on Tuesday on what our first round of releasing reveals to us about the game, and I haven't parsed through the data that we've collected yet, but an onslaught of a mysterious error regarding null quest objects made me really self-conscious about what was going on.  <em>I don't want anyone to play a game that is still buggy.  Nononononono!</em><br /><br />It's hard to debug from Player.IO's error log, though it is very informative concerning what errors popped up, whether they were serverside or clientside, when they happened, and how often.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UwlYNphQNgA/TdtRshfzMqI/AAAAAAAAAOU/u3pc3S_SXdQ/s1600/playerio_errorlog.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="186" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UwlYNphQNgA/TdtRshfzMqI/AAAAAAAAAOU/u3pc3S_SXdQ/s320/playerio_errorlog.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">just look at those graphs, dude!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Some of the players on Kongregate have been really helpful in leaving comments about their thoughts and the bugs they've encountered; but there are about 6 of these comments, and 200+ registered players, most of whom didn't really make it through the tutorial levels.  I have a good guess why: <em>the tutorials take forever to load</em>.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I'm guessing it might be because we have a lot of objects in the database, and a lot of the properties of those objects are nested objects or arrays, which must take longer to retrieve.  Seeing as tutorial levels are pretty essential for hooking in initial players, I'm hoping to make it so that the tutorial levels are completely static and client-side -- no saving data into the database, nothing.  If a player comes back, they'll just have to start over.  Hopefully this will make it so that we only really save "real" player data in the database as well, and keep out the clutter.<br /><br />So even though I really wouldn't have wanted to release the game this soon, this little bit of playtesting illuminated something that we otherwise would have learned at the last awful minute, for the final Facebook release.  Which is nice.<br /><br />As a sidenote, the last push I made to Get Across before the release were updated character sprites for our classes, "Cook," "Crafter," and "Planter."  Charlie drew the first set, which were endearingly derpy --<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BpSQDmsoKDg/TdtS8xpShpI/AAAAAAAAAOc/xeVTMU2HQDw/s1600/old_classes.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="131" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BpSQDmsoKDg/TdtS8xpShpI/AAAAAAAAAOc/xeVTMU2HQDw/s320/old_classes.png" /></a></div><br />And these are the more recent ones --<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X1nWWgR4z_E/TdtTFRAwnII/AAAAAAAAAOk/QkC5Sdg-LI0/s1600/getacross_classes.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="131" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X1nWWgR4z_E/TdtTFRAwnII/AAAAAAAAAOk/QkC5Sdg-LI0/s320/getacross_classes.png" /></a></div><br />Hopefully more character customization will come soon, though it's hard to say what we'll have time for.  2 weeks left to polish up the back-end code and the mechanics!</div>

Before it was just a dense cluster of Country Homes, which are the first tier of housing that you can buy, and thus is the building that is presently the most useless to me.  I need more population in less space!  But something about bulldozing houses for Milan Apartments or Upscale Condos is a little uncomfortable.<br /><br />My most recent additions to the city of Tummy are a cheese store and a candle shop, which are named Tummy and Whey, and The Tummy At Both Ends, respectively.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />Last week or so I attended the first <a href="https://convore.com/seattle-indies/info/">Seattle [Game Dev] Indies meetup</a> at The Capitol Club, which I walked past twice before actually discovering.  Though I cannot comfortably call myself an "indie" game dev (unless you count my research projects and the burgeoning Get Across), I wasn't quite sure what my place was, but in general just wanted to learn more about the community and see what new experiences I could make.  Everyone was nice (though some were understandably horrified that I have not yet played Portal 2, nay, have not even played the first Portal), even <a href="https://twitter.com/danctheduck">Dan</a> for some reason remembered me from my stint helping him take surveys for his game two years ago, and I was super happy to run into <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/">Alex</a> again.  I learned about the tragedy of <a href="http://thesiteformerlyknownas.zachtronicsindustries.com/?p=713">Infiniminer</a>, that a lot of people are making abstract music games, that <a href="http://flixel.org/">Flixel</a> is much more widely used than I thought, that <a href="http://playerio.com/">Player.IO</a> really <em>is</em> the way to go for multiplayer Flash games, which is good, because we finally finished paper prototyping stage and started coding Get Across.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-chd51p9HCUE/TcWGkCvpGuI/AAAAAAAAAM0/iGuChDQnJeo/s1600/playerio.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="74" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-chd51p9HCUE/TcWGkCvpGuI/AAAAAAAAAM0/iGuChDQnJeo/s320/playerio.gif" width="199" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">you the bestest</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Working with Player.IO has been really simple and fun, though it's taking a while for me to wrap my head around noSQL and the whole "We don't have rows, we have objects!" thing.  I want to learn more about noSQL.  Is it faster than relational databases?  IS it still a relational databases?!  Somehow an initial Google search was fruitless.<br /><br />Some advantages of Player.IO:<br /><ul><li>I would have had no idea how to implement network stuff otherwise, and the given code and examples make it relatively easy</li><li>GUI is really nice!</li><li>I can view every item in my database and alter each one? &nbsp;Wat!</li><li>Database queries are all asynchronous, which makes them fast</li></ul><br />And some problems we've run into:<br /><ul><li>There are three people in our team, and when we are all working together, one of us will sometimes hang at the "joining a room" dialogue</li><li>Running into vague "InternalError" problems when loading/updating the database is a pain...nothing to do for it but wait until something works all of a sudden :/</li><li>Database queries are all asynchronous, which makes it so I get results back at weird/wrong times</li></ul><br />Not deal-breakers overall, and I'm getting more and excited.

So a couple of days ago I attended <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/technologybrierdudleysblog/2014767469_zynga_launches_seattleville_be.html">the launch of Zynga's Seattle office</a>.  It was pretty delicious; I guess Zynga has their own pomegranate martini with Pop Rocks in it.  They sank to the bottom though and become saturated with t3h alcohols pretty quickly.  My other favorite food was this sort of fried wonton with the most melty sashimi in it, which came with a sort of guacamole-with-edamame substance.  Also present: hand-made marshmallows dipped in chocolate and covered in nuts and thinly sliced almonds.<br /><br />I went with David and Fransiskus and we all managed to get pictures with Mark Pincus XD<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X94S1A0OyYk/TaoFcg39kjI/AAAAAAAAALM/2cX_OsjL8G4/s1600/photo.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X94S1A0OyYk/TaoFcg39kjI/AAAAAAAAALM/2cX_OsjL8G4/s320/photo.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">and then he went off to mingle elsewhere</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then we chatted with some of the other engineers at the event, who all seemed to be peripheral to games in some way -- I even saw the guy who gave the original concept for <a href="http://heartrategames.com/">one of my research projects</a>.  Mostly I was pretty hyped to get Zynga-world money, which we did end up getting at the very end in a gift bag, along with a nifty thermos.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NzqAbYNCcdM/TaoHnkqJOxI/AAAAAAAAALU/F2A-SnJaRrA/s1600/DSC_0390.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NzqAbYNCcdM/TaoHnkqJOxI/AAAAAAAAALU/F2A-SnJaRrA/s320/DSC_0390.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">swag, yeeee</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then, because David and Fransiskus like it so much, I started playing CityVille.  Which has actually turned out to be really fun o___o I've already been playing <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/02/okay-dude-so-planting-nachos-is.html">FarmVille</a> for a while, and I started FrontierVille because of hearing the Civilization designer created it, but CityVille strikes a perfect balance in between them.  I like the clean artwork and the little people that wave at you and the general friendliness of the whole thing.  The sound effects for when you pick up different resources are also really happy-inducing somehow.  For seriose.  They're on par with Zelda SFX for uncovering mystery doors and opening treasure chests.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n_pMrKX-Dxk/TaoIAi5v67I/AAAAAAAAALc/yb0iVhSjdU8/s1600/cityville.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="249" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n_pMrKX-Dxk/TaoIAi5v67I/AAAAAAAAALc/yb0iVhSjdU8/s320/cityville.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so many things to click and feel productive with &lt;3</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Though, I guess a Zynga game is also much more fun definitively if you have a ton of people to play it with, unlike in FrontierVille, where I desperately keep posting requests for Juicy Berries and Critter Milk and have been getting no response.  There have been shy and sick baby creatures on my homestead for months.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-owd_CkgAro4/TaoJ4CfgVII/AAAAAAAAALk/sx-86Dv4v3M/s1600/frontierville.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="257" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-owd_CkgAro4/TaoJ4CfgVII/AAAAAAAAALk/sx-86Dv4v3M/s320/frontierville.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">none of you are ever getting help. &nbsp;ever</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I definitely want to incorporate the "popping out of things" like coins and XP in Get Across too, maybe so that when you move onto a tile or something you get rewarded with little coins and bits.  I'm not sure if that's too much of a "casual" mechanic that will end up turning people off, though...I guess for now we'll put it off into an advanced feature.</div>
