<p>The trailer was gorgeous and I&rsquo;m a sucker for both folklore and foxes, so I played <a href="http://neveralonegame.com/">Never Alone</a> this weekend. I started on my own and, after getting trapped in an area where character AI wasn&rsquo;t quite cutting it (and kept dropping me into an icy demise), I set up a controller so I could play with a human. (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1l21zb/playing_with_a_ps3_controller_on_pc_a_setup_guide">It&rsquo;s pretty easy, by the way!</a>)</p>

<p>It turned out to be fortunate trouble because the game is much more fun with someone else, though I admit that this could also be because I rarely play multi-player games nowadays and hugely prefer them to be cooperative when I do. The atmosphere and Iñupiaq narration were fantastic, and I loved the subtlety of certain details, such as the little halo of light that emerged from the fox&rsquo;s head whenever a spirit was near. Certain things didn&rsquo;t quite make sense — why do the spirits of the aurora fly away with you? If it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re doing something &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; what is that bad thing you&rsquo;re doing? — but it helps contributes to the surrealism that surrounds old stories.</p>

<p>I only wish the game was longer than the three hours it took us to complete it. Hopefully it&rsquo;s successful enough to warrant the creation of further chapters, and inspires others to find new ways to share their cultural stories as well. I know I&rsquo;d love to see a game with the Filipino pantheon, despite (or even because) of its incredible diversity and tension with Christianity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/smallworld1.jpg" alt="Picture of Smallworld board, with 'Dragon Master Elves' at the front"/></p>

<p class="caption">dragon master elves?!</p>


<p>Last Friday we hit up a small pub table and inconspicuously played J&rsquo;s copy of Small World, <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/">&ldquo;the fun, zany, light-hearted civilization board game!&rdquo;</a></p>

<blockquote>Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci™, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs and even humans; who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth. (<a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>This game has some disturbing colonialization themes aside; there are even pre-existing people in some territorites that you must conquer to inhabit that territory. Even so, I enjoyed this game so much that I eyed it hungrily at Card Kingdom after our party dispersed. The delicious flavor! The cool (albeit almost entirely white) characters! I love that the game naturally becomes different each time as you mix &ldquo;race powers&rdquo; and &ldquo;special powers;&rdquo; I love that the flavor of the game itself, its pictures and words, are delicious and meaningful and fly off the cardboard and became us — as in the terrifying era of K&rsquo;s Pillaging Skeletons, uprooting their femurs from mountain and farmland and laying waste across nests of Flying Trolls and Berserk Humans, resting for only a moment before rising again in greater number. <em>What</em>.</p>

<p>One weak part of the game, however, are the victory points. They are called gold; if you have the most of them at the end of the game, You Win. Flavor-wise, I don&rsquo;t feel like they entirely fit — when, during all this conquest, does gold arbitrary rise from the depths? — and there&rsquo;s also not much that you can do with them, other than occasionally exchange them to get the race you want. During the &ldquo;conquest&rdquo; phase, they are useless. What if instead you could use them to do something like increase your number of troops, and gamble to try and get more land? What if you needed to pay coins in order to roll for reinforcement, an action that is otherwise totally free and something you usually want to do? It seems like a missed opportunity for <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2010/03/flydrill-and-logistical-gameplay.html">logistical gameplay</a>, and allowing players the pleasure of &ldquo;not simply doing something, but doing it well — optimizing it to perfection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A also noted that, though he felt he had made the right &ldquo;decisions,&rdquo; he still placed last in our group of four, and didn&rsquo;t grasp how he could have played the game better. He didn&rsquo;t feel that he had &ldquo;gained experience&rdquo; and learned how to play the game any better. Though I can&rsquo;t find it now, it reminds me of what I have read once regarding <a href="http://spryfox.com/our-games/tripletown/">Triple Town</a>, and how it seems to be a simple game until you make a mistake — <em>and then you get it</em>, you get what the game is about, you feel excited to give it another go.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/smallworld2.jpg" alt="Picture of Smallworld board, with a ton of stuff on it"/></p>

<p class="caption">smallworld board, getting all exciting as stuff accumulates</p>


<p>I hope to try out the expansions sometime, though the use of &ldquo;gypsy&rdquo; as a race in one of them is disconcerting, and reminds me of how uncomfortable the overall theme is.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/twa.png" alt="Screenshot of Thomas Was Alone"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/thomas-was-alone/screenshots/gameShotId,566500/">via</a>)</p>


<p><em>Thomas Was Alone</em> was super cute, if more ambiguous than I personally like. I liked the personality given to all the different shapes, though their common heroism and conceit got a little old as the game went on, which was why Laura&rsquo;s cynicism made her my favorite (though I felt compelled inexlicably to keep calling her &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo;). I loved that the levels were tilted, the play of light, the strange colors. (Though I wonder if any colorblind users had a hard time playing?)</p>

<p>One thing I think the game could have been improved was the game&rsquo;s sense of progression; though numbers ticked up each level, after a while they became meaningless, and now that the game is finished I&rsquo;m not totally sure what I would use them for. The introduction of each of the colored shapes, Thomas&rsquo;s &ldquo;death,&rdquo; and the era of the gray shapes seemed to be the largest movements in the story, and though each was accompanied with a fun snippet of &ldquo;The AIs are gaining sentience!&rdquo; flavor I didn&rsquo;t really have a sense that things were reaching their end until the end came suddenly to meet me. Some levels seemed like little &ldquo;drabbles&rdquo; and experiments, which I completed without much more effort than would take for me to click a cow in Farmville, and it would have been cool to see something else related to AIs breaking their previous ways of being. Breaking through the borders of levels — intentionally disobeying orders — something to add to the flavor text.</p>

<p>I played <em>Thomas Was Alone</em> on a projector and if you have the opportunity to do so yourself I recommend it. All those rectangles are like way better when they&rsquo;re as big as your face.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZKxZeym4hI/UnhNh5LTGHI/AAAAAAAAER8/ijPCNF5uWhM/s1600/pokemonxy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZKxZeym4hI/UnhNh5LTGHI/AAAAAAAAER8/ijPCNF5uWhM/s640/pokemonxy.jpg" width="510" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshots of the websites for Pokemon X &amp; Y<br />Japan (above), Netherlands (bottom)</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">A couple weeks ago we analyzed the marketing sites for Pokemon X and Y across different countries. It turns out that all sites for Pokemon X and Y are the same — except for the one in Japan, which is shown at the top of the screenshot above.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The differences between the Japanese site and the rest-of-the-world sites include:</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1"><br /></div><h4>Feature Descriptions</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites contain more information about the game, for example, direct links to features like the Pokemon Global Link; on the Japanese site, these are internal.</div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Hype</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites feature a large image carousel on their homepage, which shows other features of the game, all shown to excite:&nbsp;<i>Discover the Might of Mega-Evolved Pokemon! A New World of Amazing Pokemon!</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div>In contrast, the front page of the Japanese site merely says:&nbsp;<i>Pokemon, heading to a brand new dimension</i>! (Referring, I think, to the 3D?)</div></div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Obvious Marketing</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites contain immediate links to buy the game, as well as the 3DS; the Japanese site does not. (According to Julius, the 2DS isn't even available in Japan, perhaps because "Everyone there already has a 3DS!")</div></div><div><h4><br /></h4><h4>JavaScript</h4><div>The Japanese site has very little Javascript, and each page looks to be straight HTML. Additionally, text is often baked straight into the images, rather than being left as straight text, which is often the case in websites due to accessibility issues. (Text on images cannot be easily parsed by screenreaders. Some users also prefer to render text on websites to be more readable, for example, through the excellent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.beelinereader.com/">BeeLine</a>&nbsp;app.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Description vs. Instruction</h4><div>The Japanese site is more descriptive of the story and characters of the game; the non-Japanese site is more instructive of how to play the Pokemon game.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="p1">We chalked up the majority of the differences the fact that Pokemon is more popular in Japan; Japanese game-players may not need to be particularly taught about Pokemon, or persuaded to buy it. But, this exercise makes me more interested in other facets of Japanese web design. Why is there so much baked-in text, why aren't there fancy hover menu states, why is the design so flat compared to the chrome and bevels of the non-Japanese sites? Is web accessibility less important in the Japanese corner of the internet, or is it handled in a way that's different in the US?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">One final note: out class lecture that week was done by Kate Edwards, current Executive Director of IGDA, who shared some cool stories regarding the "culturization" problems she's encountered when helping to ship games across international borders. Something she noted was that, in the Netherlands, "adult" games don't need to be localized into Dutch because the adults there prefer to play the games in English. So, the fact that the Pokemon X and Y site text is all written in Dutch…</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><br /><div class="p1">…well…you can totally still enjoy the world of Kalos as a grown-up grad student with a full-time job. Just saying!</div></div>

And weirdness! And mysteriousness!</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Spoilers ahead.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>1.</h2></div><div class="p1">One of my favorite parts of adventure games is the characterization that rises through interaction with items. Do characters like a certain item, or dislike it? Does the item bring up deep heartbroken memories of the past? How do they parse and react, and what does their rumination say for who they are? I'm reminded of Nancy Drew's endearing enthusiasm for lifting up random objects ("This plastic DNA model will be useful!") and Phoenix Wright's skeptical amusement when things like puppies are added to his inventory.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The most interesting item in the game for me was the toy cat, which I enjoyed petting all the time to accrue invisible "sanity" points. Engaging with the cat toy in particular puts you in the shoes and brain of the lone survivor himself, tinkering with a plush at the end of the world, just to have something light-hearted to do.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>2.</h2></div><div class="p1">Speaking of the cat plush, I loved the detail of this game — the unidentifiable flesh-like substances stretching across the wall — the way your map was dark unless you viewed it under sources of light — the specific food items like Delicious Ham, the creepy bottomless repositories of pills and Rotten Meats.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>3.</h2></div><div class="p1">A criticism of <i>Lone Survivor</i> seems to be that it was not scary enough. I played it at the height of summer and even then it was plenty terrifying, even if most of my stress and fear stemmed from being unable to hoard my bullets as obsessively as I would have liked.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Another scary part: putting your hand in that horrifying pink-red flesh-pixel hole. I <i>really </i>did not want to do that.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>4.</h2></div><div class="p1">The dream sequences were cool, and the characters therein intriguingly surreal, which I loved. Ultimately, however, I didn't feel that these scenes contributed to a larger understanding of what was going on, which was disappointing. Rather than deep, the first ending I received was vague, and a letdown. After carrying and caring for this dude I'd wanted a little more than a whiff of a broken heart. I wanted to know more about what this girl meant to the protagonist, how her departure left his life with zombie-filled corridors.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>5.</h2></div><div class="p1">I got my ending by playing as paragon as possible. I wanted to see if other endings would give me closure, so I found them on Youtube. Each one seemed vaguer than the last, and didn't interest me that much. I don't have a particular love of multiple endings and for me it's because they lack impact: I've only rarely encountered any set that comfortably resolves all issues and tension introduced in the game, and the way that such endings are reached never quite seems to match the decisions you made to get there.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">In the case of <i>Lone Survivor, </i>the decisions that you make add to an invisible calculator which eventually spits out one of these endings: for example, killing more monsters gives you endings that imply you're mentally unstable. But why? What is it about killing these things makes you this way? The worst ending can also be achieved not just by killing monsters, but "eating food when not hungry or hurt" and "sleeping for no reason" (per <a href="http://lonesurvivor.wikia.com/wiki/Endings">this wiki</a>). What's <i>that </i>connection?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><h2>6.</h2></div><div class="p1">This was my other favorite part: getting that white cat to come live with me. I guess it's strange to be saying that after my demands for meaningfulness, since other than the invisible points, hanging out with the cat doesn't reveal any more of the protagonist's inner story. But playing with the cat, I felt for the first time that I was doing something in the game that I personally wanted, like it was really <i>me</i> in there, and not me poking through things in a dude-shaped glove.<br /><br />Come here! Come <i>here</i>, little digital thing!<br /><br /></div><div class="p1"><i>come and be with me forever</i><br /><i><br /></i><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tvhPIy5tDo/UilDcBOQcrI/AAAAAAAAEBc/f6aLd4GxHlk/s1600/Sunny.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3tvhPIy5tDo/UilDcBOQcrI/AAAAAAAAEBc/f6aLd4GxHlk/s1600/Sunny.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://lonesurvivor.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Characters">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><i><br /></i></div></div>
