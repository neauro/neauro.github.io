  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
The field of Human-Computer Interaction started in the 1980s, borne of cognitive and computer science.  It started with the idea that humans and computers both have behaviors that are algorithmic, and at a human&#8217;s heart is a little processor chipping away at data and outputting actions accordingly.  Around this time, Xerox came out with The Graphical User Interface. &nbsp;It was a novel framework for user interaction, and people were like, &#8220;Whoa!&#8221; And thus was cognitive science applied to improving GUIs by the millions.<br /><br />Soon, however, people became dissatisfied.  HCI as it was, hand-in-hand with cognitive sciences, was as limited as a college girl off at Ivy League and still dating someone in senior year of high school.  They had a lot of good moments the past year, they had some times that were defining of each other&#8217;s identity, but in the end, HCI just needed to broaden out, because humans don&#8217;t have processor hearts.  Suchman (in <em>Plans and Situated Actions</em>) was arguing with AI researchers in the dorm hallway and HCI, having left her door open for potential visitors, overheard.<br /><br />&#8220;Human action is &#8216;situated,&#8217;&#8221; Suchman said.  Humans respond to opportunity when it knocks, and are flexible to a change in resources.  &#8220;Computer programs may follow algorithms, but people do not.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Just look,&#8221; Suchman said, &#8220;at all these people who struggled with the design of this photocopier (1987).  If people were <em>truly</em> algorithmic, they would have tried to solve their usability problems in the same way.&#8221; Alas, everyone found their way to hatred of this copy-machine in a multitude of ways.<br /><br />This idea, this <em>situatedness</em>, drew right from Ethnomethodology, the guy in the opposite hallway, who grew up with nice sociology parents but had somehow turned out to be unusually rebellious and anti-theoretical.  He was all about moment-by-moment actions analyzed as reponses to events in a &#8220;local scene of action.&#8221; He was all about figuring out what made you (or groups of you) tick, and making you efficient, consistent, coherent.  He was best friends with Anthropology, whose whole life was about having comprehensive knowledge about every acquaintance and passerby.<br /><br />Ethnomethodology was pretty cool, but his parents never got over it.  They couldn&#8217;t compromise.  They tried to keep other people away from him, and to this day Ethnomethodology remained relegated to &#8220;a radical antitheory position.&#8221;  His wish to work above generalization and abstraction were shoved into a corner, and eventually even Anthropology, once a wide-eyed fact-hoarder, left and became theoretical herself.<br /><br />It was alright.  Ethnomethodology continued.  He focused.  He loved conversation, eventually produced rules about it: &#8220;turn-taking,&#8221; &#8220;repair,&#8221; &#8220;back-channeling.&#8221; In doing so he embraced something his parents had always wanted: generalization.  Soon he was spouting things like &#8220;highlighting for perception&#8221; and &#8220;professional vision,&#8221; and every multi-syllable ambiguity sent him an inch further down &#8220;the slippery slope of theorizing.&#8221;<br /><br />But it wasn&#8217;t enough for the kind of foundational theory HCI was really looking for.  HCI hung out with him a couple times, but as the years went on their interactions degenerated from brief hellos, strained smalltalk, unanswered Facebook Event invites.  Ethnomethodology had an &#8220;attitude of indifference&#8221; which didn&#8217;t seem that stable.  HCI kept a memory of empirical studies, of software usage data, but eventually all those nights she spent with him underneath the moon, talking &#8211; just, <em>talking</em>, about anything &#8211; faded.<br /><br />HCI <i>needed</i> that foundational theory. &nbsp;She wanted to learn more, not just about herself and her many facets (Psychology, Sociology, Computer Science, and so on), but about what she wanted to <em>do</em> with her life.  It wasn&#8217;t so much about trying to make all these different parts of her speak on the same level, but more about having an understanding of her own identity above them all.  Without theory she couldn&#8217;t compare the past to the present, couldn&#8217;t learn about whether she was really becoming better.  She couldn&#8217;t know whether her next step forward was actually a step back.  She couldn&#8217;t know whether some pet peeve of hers was typical, couldn&#8217;t decide what was important.<br /><br />Without theory, she couldn&#8217;t be as good as Science, who was not useful because she was always real or always right, but because she was always helpful and wanted.  Science could stumble, could even make mistakes: but even those missteps led to progress.<br /><br /><br /><br />Source:<br />Kaptelini &amp; Nardi, <em>Acting with Technology: Activity Theory and Interaction Design.</em> 2009.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yesterday I facilitated my first class at the <a href="http://pscs.org/">Puget Sound Community School</a> (PSCS). The class is called &#8220;Make Games: Design,&#8221; and is a companion to Alex&#8217;s &#8220;Make Games: Programming,&#8221; previous iterations of which <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2010/10/teaching-flixel.html">written about before</a>.<br /><br />There are four boys in the class. I had been hoping to intrigue some girls into it, and during my pitch before the school kept eyeing the ones in the front row.  <i>Yeah!  Girls can play games too!  Check it ouuutt!  </i>In retrospect, I realize that I might have erred in my pitch by not mentioning that our discussions will not center around the intricacies of triple-A titles these girls may have never heard of, much less played. Saying that might have made the class seem more accessible. As it was, the kids that joined my class were all those that had been huddled in the back of the room on their laptops.<br /><br />Which isn&#8217;t a bad thing; it just makes me wince a little to see a group of laptop kids completely girl-less.  Then again, girls don&#8217;t all have to like computers.<br /><br />Anyway, the class was off to a good start.  My four students are incredibly bright and eager to participate in a way that&#8217;s refreshing and relieving &#8211; after all, I&#8217;ve myself been a part of a wordless classroom a teacher is trying to engage.  After introductions, I asked what everyone&#8217;s favorite games were, and why.  By the end, we had talked about Portal 2, WoW, Skyrim, Skyward Sword, The Darkness, and they all had good keywords to say about the games &#8211; things like, <i>This game was good because of its goals &#8211; because of its progression &#8211; because there&#8217;s always brand new content &#8211; because of good feedback&#8230;</i><br /><br />And, inversely, <i>This game [Skyward Sword] was bad because they had this whole world you could explore, except not really because all you could find were these treasure chests you couldn&#8217;t even interact with&#8230;</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />Something that I heard too often for my taste were things like <i>This game is just AWESOME!</i>  Somehow one of them had convinced me to watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AtM3PGyiQUc">the trailer for Metal Gear Solid 5</a> and I watched them salivate with a sort of horror.  Really?  <em>Really?</em><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8rlbB9C4rJk/TwvDScY1OII/AAAAAAAAAl8/dZI4u-KteLQ/s1600/mgs5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="174" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8rlbB9C4rJk/TwvDScY1OII/AAAAAAAAAl8/dZI4u-KteLQ/s320/mgs5.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this silver-haired bishounen is holding up a freshly-extracted spinal column</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My head resonates with<i> </i>something that sounds disturbingly like <i>Kids these days!  </i>But I can&#8217;t let my heavy cynicism and bitter boredom with big-budget graphics-intensive gaming get in the way of talking about core design.  Which, though I only have about 9 hours to do it over the course of the next 9 weeks, I definitely want to do &#8211; and if at the end of it these people appreciate games not just for their diamond fluff, but <i>also </i>because they understand their design and creation, I&#8217;ll consider this experiment in facilitating a success.</div>

I tend to go on and off with photography in general (though associating my taking pictures with &#8220;photography&#8221; and its professional air still makes me wince), but I can tie my decrease in photo-taking activity to some specific things this time, namely:<br /><ol><li>The purse that I am currently using for everything, a shoulder-bag Haiku that&#8217;s lightweight and perfect for notebooks but bulges with a D40 in it;</li><li>My lack of personal computer with which to edit <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/raws-vs-jpeg-fine.html">raws</a>&nbsp;<raws>&#8211; my main computer broke after coming back from San Francisco, and I&#8217;ve been subsisting off Andou&#8217;s desktop and my work computer ever since.</raws></li></ol>As a result, I&#8217;ve been spending most of my time tinkering around with my iPod for photo-taking purposes. The picture quality, compared to my beloved 35mm lens, is obscene, but challenging. How do I get a good picture despite the gross noise and relative inability to get close to a subject?<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been cheating with <a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a><instagram>, which I initially despised as hipster filter city, but now enjoy, mainly because<br /><ol><li>I&#8217;m over the arguments of what constitutes &#8220;real&#8221; photography, and</li><li>&#8220;It&#8217;s just what it is &#8211; pictures from your phone.&#8221; Nothing more, nothing less. Thus was the revelation of <a href="http://www.nclrmrz.com/">Nicole</a><nicole>, my old roommate.</nicole></li></ol>The filters aren&#8217;t perfect (who would ever use Kelvin? I mean, really) and the faux tilt-shift filter can also look pretty fauxlty (ohoho). But I like my 24/7 shiba inu photo stream and the silent camaraderie of people liking your photos, somehow more earnest and without the nuance of self-interest on Tumblr.

A couple weeks ago I visited Portland with Andou&#8217;s family.

Alas.<br /><br />Portland seems well known for its <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/03/portland_leads_us_cities_in_bi.html">bike-friendly streets</a>&nbsp;but when I went there what I first noticed were the recycling bins, which are quite different than the metal blue ones here in Seattle, <a href="http://www.danielmoorephoto.com/Urban-Scenes/Seattle-Walk-About/9465985_6nv5LQ/2/635124291_dNNLh#!i=635124291&amp;k=dNNLh">which are cylindrical and have a&nbsp;</a><a href="http://www.danielmoorephoto.com/Urban-Scenes/Seattle-Walk-About/9465985_6nv5LQ/2/635124291_dNNLh#!i=635124291&amp;k=dNNLh">strange blooming shape on top</a>. &nbsp;Seattle recycling bins also look like they&#8217;re comprised of slats of metal, but between them you can see only black &#8211; not like Portland&#8217;s recycling bin, which bares its bowels.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lS-t3ev1EVM/TwHxo8zM0jI/AAAAAAAAAlM/oni_Nw9odgw/s640/blogger-image--2061979078.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lS-t3ev1EVM/TwHxo8zM0jI/AAAAAAAAAlM/oni_Nw9odgw/s640/blogger-image--2061979078.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">all these beautiful buildings around us,<br />and i&#8217;m taking pictures of a recycling bin</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I really like them, because:<br /><ol><li>The &#8220;input&#8221; areas are varied. &nbsp;Seattle only has a circle to indicate disposal of cans and bottles; this bin has regions not just for cans but also paper. &nbsp;If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned about design, it&#8217;s that people don&#8217;t read, but rather will respond to something by the way that it looks &#8211; circles and rectangles for bottles and cans and newspaper are more subconsciously compelling than text signs (though those are here too, obviously).</li><li>The way you can see into the bin exposes a sort of accountability for the things that are in there, and might end up encouraging a sort of bandwagon effect too &#8211; look at all the other people recycling! &nbsp;<i>Everybody&#8217;s </i>doing it! &nbsp;(On the other hand, even I can see clearly that not everything in this bin is recyclable, so I guess it could work the other way around too: a passerby may notice that there&#8217;s styrofoam junk in there and just throw in more styrofoam because, hey, <i>everybody&#8217;s</i>&nbsp;doing it!)</li><li>Seeing your can/bottle in there provides better feedback for your earth-saving habits &#8211; or at least more than if you had just tossed it into an opaque black cylinder.</li></ol><div>I wonder if Portland has any data about whether these bins are more successful than the previous iteration of recycling bins.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FubFZjCftFo/TwfCTl8BroI/AAAAAAAAAlw/WtZPzkdviTc/s1600/13943360356611e1abb01231381b65e3_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FubFZjCftFo/TwfCTl8BroI/AAAAAAAAAlw/WtZPzkdviTc/s320/13943360356611e1abb01231381b65e3_7.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">portland itself was very nice, by the way</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

I myself start feeling pretty good about life and chase them around with my camera for a bit, usually to no avail. They&#8217;re much too shy and quick and the lighting on the building much too florescent.<br /><br />Having now been in offices with dogs wandering about both here and in San Francisco, I&#8217;m sold on the both psychological and cuddle-related benefits of furry compatriots.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div></div>

Okay. Nice. I started grabbing Chapel Geists and also, at some point, a Cloistered Youth, Screeching Bats for the bomb factor, a Falkenwrath Noble. There&#8217;s just something so classy about white/black.<br /><br />Second pack: Hinterland Harbor, Innistrad&#8217;s rare blue/green land, something I&#8217;d like but which doesn&#8217;t fit the colors I&#8217;m primarily using. Shoot. Luckily Andou was the person I was passing to, and I was sure that he would take it. &gt;)<br /><br />Third pack: <i>Skaab Ruinator. &nbsp;</i>Which pretty much required&nbsp;that I start using blue along with my other two colors.<br /><br />Figuring out how much mana is appropriate for a deck is what I think is the hardest about deck-building. &nbsp;It was a struggle especially in this one, since I had Screeching Bats, Geist-Honored Monks, and the Ruinator &#8211; each of which require two black, two white, and two blue mana respectively, which makes selecting colors harder. &nbsp;Still, this deck did pretty well; at the very least there were few cases in which I didn&#8217;t have mana at all, and when I had Skaab Ruinator I always managed to push him out successfully.<br /><br />The full list &#8211;<br /><br /><b>Creatures</b><br />1x Skaab Ruinator<br />1x Cloistered Youth<br />1x Silverchase Fox<br />1x Geist-Honored Monk<br />1x Unruly Mob<br />1x Slayer of the Wicked<br />2x Chapel Geist<br />1x Thraben Sentry<br />1x Village Bell-Ringer<br />1x Disciple of Griselbrand<br />2x Screeching Bat<br />1x Village Cannibals<br />1x Falkenrath Noble<br />1x Morkrut Bansee<br /><br /><b>Spells/Artifacts</b><br />1x Moment of Heroism<br />1x Rebuke<br />1x Bonds of Faith<br />1x Skeletal Grimace<br />1x Blazing Torch<br />1x Silver-Inlaid Dagger<br /><br /><b>Lands</b><br />8x Swamp<br />7x Plains<br />5x Island<br /><br />In the end, Matt won &#8211; he had a deck with 3&nbsp;<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=243211">Burning Vengeance</a>, which made ashes of everyone. <br /><br /></div>
