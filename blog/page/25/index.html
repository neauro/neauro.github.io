And I mean, TED talks, amirite?<br /><br />But as the lecture progressed, it started talking more concerning giving feedback based on students&#8217; education and such, all very game-y things which made it more obvious why it was being circulated through that mailing list.<br /><br /><blockquote>But then I started getting letters from teachers. And the teachers would write, saying, &#8220;We use your videos to flip the classroom&#8230;what I do is I assign the lectures for homework. And what used to be homework, I now have the students doing in the classroom.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8230;when those teachers are doing that, there&#8217;s the obvious benefit &#8211; the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did. They can pause, repeat at their own pace, at their own time. But the more interesting thing is &#8211; and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom &#8211; by removing the one size fits all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home, and then when you go to the classroom, letting them do work, having the teacher walk around, having the peers actually be able to interact with each other, <strong>these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom. They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience &#8211; 30 kids with their fingers on their lips, not allowed to interact with each other. A teacher, no matter how good, has to give this one size fits all lecture to 30 students &#8211; blank faces, slightly antagonistic &#8211; and now it&#8217;s a human experience. Now they&#8217;re actually interacting with each other.</strong></blockquote><br />That technology is the humanizing thing, rather than classrooms, definitely is not intuitive at all &#8211; and when I hear something like assigning students videos for homework, the first thing I think is, <em>Are they really going to do this?</em> Are high school and younger students really going to subject themselves to mental stimulation outside of school itself?<br /><br />I guess the main belief is that people really do want to improve themselves, and will do so, given the opportunity; this is a big part of <em><a href="http://realityisbroken.org/">Reality is Broken</a></em> by Jane McGonigal, which I&#8217;m presently reading (and almost done with!).  She writes that one of the things that&#8217;s essential to human happiness is &#8220;the experience, or at least the hope, of being successful.  We want to feel powerful in our own lives and show off to others what we&#8217;re good at.  We want to be optimistic about our own chances for success, to aspire to something, and to feel like we&#8217;re getting better over time.&#8221;<br /><br />Which brings me back to my high school, which always bothered me.  We were reknowned for having tons of AP courses and turning out students that did really well in them; I took AP Computer Science A and AB there (back when AB was still offered) and our teacher told us that the girls in our class were the stark majority of all the girls that took the AP Compsci test.  By graduation, I&#8217;d taken around 12 AP courses, with grades of 3 or above in all the tests. <span class="shh">Damn you, Chemistry!  And Physics B!  Arrrghhh</span><br /><br />One thing that was unique about our school was that if you wanted to take an AP course, you could; there was no minimum GPA requirement, no test that you had to pass.  For some national government bill simulation, our class tried to pass a bill that would allow this sort of &#8220;If you want to take a harder course, do it&#8221; behavior in every high school, but it was voted down by some east coast school that said, essentially, &#8220;If you just allow anyone to take an AP course, then you will ruin the class for everyone else.  The teacher will have to cater to these dumb people, the discussions will have to be held on a lower level, we deny it.&#8221;<br /><br />Which made us all really angry, I guess, and talking about it with my friends later, we pretty much agreed: If you&#8217;re failing behind in class, it&#8217;s not the teacher&#8217;s fault, sorry bro, you&#8217;ve just got to keep up.<br /><br />So if you wanted to take AP Everything in our school, you could &#8211; and I kind of imagine this as also being parallel to having that opportunity to be better, to learn more.  Our AP courses, however, had a reputation for being pretty difficult, which, though it may be true, also contributed to what I think was an unfair gap in our school.  On one side were the AP students; on the other side, your stereotypical high school students who traded drugs during lunch and graduated to work at the mall a couple miles from the school.<br /><br />This itself is an unfair description, but also what happens, not just in one high school, when education is offered and only a subset take advantage of it.  If education is all about success and being better, why do some students not pursue it, despite its realtion to basic human happiness?  What is it about our present education system that is anti-compelling?<br /><br />And we AP kids, who I speak of so highly, what did we really learn &#8211; did we come out of high school with grades that prove usable knowledge, or are our A&#8217;s just badges of facts that we&#8217;ve memorized and will forget the next year?<br /><br /><blockquote>In a traditional classroom, you have a couple of homework, homework, lecture, homework, lecture, and then you have a snapshot exam. And that exam, whether you get a 70 percent, an 80 percent, a 90 percent, or a 95 percent, the class moves on to the next topic. And even that 95 percent student, what was the five percent they didn&#8217;t know? Maybe they didn&#8217;t know what happens when you raise something to the zero power. And then you go build on that in the next concept. <strong>That&#8217;s analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle, and maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time, and I give you that bicycle for two weeks. And then I come back after two weeks, and I say, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s see. You&#8217;re having trouble taking left turns. You can&#8217;t quite stop. You&#8217;re an 80 percent bicyclist.&#8221; So I put a big C stamp on your forehead and then I say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a unicycle.&#8221;</strong><br /><br />But as ridiculous as that sounds, that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s happening in our classrooms right now. And the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing calculus all of a sudden, despite being smart, despite having good teachers. And it&#8217;s usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation. So our model is learn math the way you&#8217;d learn anything, like the way you would learn a bicycle. Stay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle. Do it as long as necessary until you have mastery. The traditional model, it penalizes you for experimentation and failure, but it does not expect mastery. <strong>We encourage you to experiment. We encourage you to failure. But we do expect mastery.</strong></blockquote><br />&#8220;Encouraging failure&#8221; or at least allowing it, accepting it, and using it, rather than punishing it, is also a very <em>game</em> thing.  I&#8217;m reminded of when Andreas told me a story about a teacher of his who was a little eccentric, an intelligent world traveler (or something of the sort) who abruptly settled down to become a teacher and allowed his students to take tests over and over again until they learned the material.  If you have an opportunity to do better, to <em>be</em> visibly better, I don&#8217;t know who would leave it.<br /><br /><span class="shh">I mean, I guess if I had the opportunity to be visibly better at baseball or something it probably wouldn&#8217;t matter to me.  But that&#8217;s because I already have other things that I&#8217;d rather be improving.</span><br /><br />Something else that I really like about this anti-traditional model is the idea of <em>experimenting</em>, which I feel was really lacking in my education up until a very recent point (as in, a couple of months ago, when I realized <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/02/game-bonding-time.html">I could make games</a> if I wanted).  A lot of grade school is all about just learning basics &#8211; which is good, but I wish that it wasn&#8217;t in college that you started questioning <em>why</em> something happens, and start to expand on ideas, and be imaginative.<br /><br />At 11:48 of this video, there&#8217;s a presentation of a &#8220;dashboard&#8221; which basically shows a detailed breakdown of how each student is doing.<br /><br /><blockquote>Green means the student&#8217;s already proficient. Blue means they&#8217;re working on it &#8211; no need to worry. Red means they&#8217;re stuck. And what the teacher does is literally just say, &#8220;Let me intervene on the red kids.&#8221; Or even better, &#8220;Let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their peer.&#8221;</blockquote><br />This whole part reminds me of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=new+york+game+school">the game school</a> in New York, which, despite being incredibly awesome and employing game techniques to improve students&#8217; will to learn, seems incredibly specific.  Though both this dashboard and the game school use visible acquisition of mastery to motivate students, I could see the dashboard being more easily used by schools like my old high school.  Something like this is not just helpful to motivate students, but to allow them to see where they need help &#8211; no small feat, really, because I&#8217;ve always thought that the biggest obstacle to learning something is knowing the right question to ask.<br /><br />I wonder if any teachers actually take talks like this seriously.  Whenever I think of grade school education, it seems incredibly set in its ways.  If it changed, what would happen to all the iconic high school drama and archetypes?  YOU CAN&#8217;T HAVE A &#8220;THE SMART KID&#8221; IF EVERYONE IS SMART, OKAY.</div>

It took a couple months for it to arrive, but once it did, I opened it <em>and didn&#8217;t close it until I was done</em> (pretty much).<br /><br />What the heck?!  Katniss seemed at first to be almost a Bella-type character &#8211; a little snarky, a little spiteful of the people around her, such as her mother &#8211; but unlike empty, hate-for-nothing Bella, she had reasons and whys.  And at first I thought that The Hunger Games would be nothing new &#8211; maybe something like Battle Royale and The Running Man put together &#8211; but somehow &#8211; it was just <em>perfect</em>.  A suspenseful story, full-fleshed characters with a lot to fight for, <br /><br />Luckily the next two books came in more promptly (maybe because everyone always wants to read the first book?) and I finished the second at 4:30am, and the third at the following 2:30am, and then just lied there in bed, exhausted.  It&#8217;s so rare that you just find books <em>this good</em>.  So rare that there&#8217;s a YA book about war that I feel treats it with the gravity and heartbreak that I feel war deserves &#8211; makes you feel the pain of people you love dying, for no reason, just so that one person can be in power and not another.  And the pain that the characters went through felt so <em>powerful</em>&#8230;<br /><br />You really should just read it yourself o___o There&#8217;s only a couple books in this world like these ones.<br /><br />After reading it, I felt more inspired to write the story that I&#8217;ve been working on since forever, to <em>really</em> write it, to make it this good.  But, I feel so in awe.  How could I possibly ever be this good?  How would I be able to put believably put my characters through this much, believably have them get themselves out of it?</div>

And even when I received the confirming e-mail, I honestly didn&#8217;t think that it was that big of a deal.  No one ever talked to me about grad school — not my parents — I didn&#8217;t really get what the difference was between an MS and a PHD until a month ago.  It was only ever seriously mentioned to me by my high school computer science teacher, and even then I don&#8217;t think he meant for me to pursue HCDE/HCI/H-etc., which, despite my great interest in it, still seems to me to be a sort of &#8220;liberal artsy&#8221; type of study, and therefore somehow not as prestigious as something mathy or sciencey.  (No offense to any liberal artsy folk — after all, I am one of you at heart — and surely you must know too, the feeling of somehow being <em>wrong</em> because it seems like <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-11-23/politics/obama.science_1_science-education-math-and-science-president-obama?_s=PM:POLITICS">even the president disapproves of you</a>.)<br /><br />In any case.  I am happy that I&#8217;m working on a degree in computer science, but the fact is that I really feel like I just haven&#8217;t&#8230;felt like I&#8217;ve learned everything that I wanted to.  I feel like I&#8217;ve spent most of my undergrad years half-asleep at the wheel, and now I&#8217;ve only just woken up and realized that I can do <em>other things</em>, I can stretch beyond given assignments, I can apply for jobs and pick myself up if it doesn&#8217;t work out.  And that&#8217;s why I went after the Master&#8217;s, mostly: because I&#8217;ve really liked what little I&#8217;ve learned about design, because I want more reasons to stay in Seattle, because I still want to be a student, because I was cruising Bungie&#8217;s site and it had one position I was interested in, and for this position they were hiring people <em>with advanced education in HCI or related fields</em>.<br /><br />Today I broke the news to Alex and he hugged me super tightly, the same way Mariko and Leilani did, and he congratulated me like Andreas and even his parents did, and I started to feel like, <em>Wait.<br /><br />Is this more important than I think it is?  What have I gotten myself into?</em><br /><br />I am looking forward to it, though.  I hope that when I arrive at that first class, when I get my first homework assignment, that I feel like it&#8217;s a delight to do and not a chore.  What a novel thing, to be so excited about studying.</div>

Okay so, applications go through the operating system to obtain data from the disk, using system calls.  There are a couple types of system calls.<br /><br />When an application makes a <strong>blocking system call</strong>, the application stops executing, and moves into the operating system&#8217;s wait queue.  When the system call completes, the application gets placed back to the run queue, and when it&#8217;s ready to execute, it gets the response back from the completed system call.  Most operating systems use blocking system calls because blocking application code is easier to understand.<br /><br />But some user-side processes need non-blocking I/O and so make <strong>non-blocking system calls</strong>, a good example of which are human-interface devices: i.e. the mouse, the keyboard.  Input has to be taken and used, and can&#8217;t be delayed until later.  When an operating system supports non-blocking system calls, a call doesn&#8217;t stop execution of the application, but rather returns quickly, indicating how much data that it was able to read immediately.<br /><br />One way that a programmer can deal with overlapping execution of code and I/O is to write a multi-threaded application, so that some threads can do blocking system calls while others execute code.<br /><br />An alternative to non-blocking system calls are <strong>asynchronous system calls</strong>, which also return immediately, and allow the application to continue executing code.  Later, when the I/O finishes, the application is notified via some shared variable or a call-back routine or an interrupt.  The main difference is that with a non-blocking system call, the immediate return contains whatever data it was able to read immediately, whereas an asynchronous system call will eventually finish reading everything it was supposed to and return that data later.</div>

It&#8217;s Thursday night/Friday morning, which means it&#8217;s time to cram-study for the OS quiz tomorrow!  <span class="shh">This cram session brought to you by coke obtained at a Rails party at Joshu&#8217;s place.</span><br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">File Systems</span><br />So we&#8217;ve most recently gone over file system stuff, <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/02/operating-system-notes-fat-file-system.html">a little bit</a> of which I&#8217;ve talked about (mostly FAT file systems.)<br /><br />File system in general have a couple simple roles:<ul><li>they implement an abstraction (files/directories) for storage of data</li><li>they logically organize files (i.e. into a hierarchy of directories)</li><li>they allow people to share data (in terms of access control, consistency)</li></ul><br />A <strong>file</strong> is basically just a collection of data which also has certain properties (i.e. size, owner, last modified date, etc.) Files also have &#8220;types&#8221; which allow them to be understood by the file system or by other programs &#8211; i.e., a file can be a .txt, or an .exe, or a directory, which is actually just a generic &#8220;file&#8221; which contains a list of other files.  Types are encoded in a file&#8217;s extension.<br /><br />Some file systems allow applications to access data in different ways &#8211; i.e. sequentially (reading bytes one at a time), or by direct access (giving the application a block/byte number), or by indexed access (like a database), etc.<br /><br />Given some path name, like <code>C:\one\two\three</code>, the file system will access that folder first by opening <code>C:</code>, then searching for <code>one\</code>, then opening <code>one\</code>, then searching for <code>two\</code>, then opening <code>two\</code>&#8230;basically the file system spends a lot of time walking down directory paths, which is why &#8220;open&#8221; is usually a separate function from &#8220;read/write.&#8221;  To make directory crawling go faster, the file system will cache some prefix lookups, like <code>C:\Windows</code>.<br /><br />File systems also have the happy job of implementing a protection system for its files, either by controlling who can access a file, or by controlling by whom a file is accessed.  Some models for representing protection are<ul><li><strong>access control lists (ACLs)</strong>, in which each object knows what user can do what with it, and</li><li><strong>capabilities</strong>, in which each user knows what they can do with each object.</li></ul><br />Capabilities can be handed off, which makes sharing easier; but ACLs are easier to manage, since you can just have a file and say, &#8220;This is system32, <em>no one write to this ever</em>.&#8221;  ACLs can grow pretty large when an object is heavily shared between a lot of users, though they can be simplified by categorizing the users into &#8220;groups&#8221; (i.e. an object knows it can be altered by admins, but only read by normal users).<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">Disks</span><br />So the file system goes on top of the disk, which has all dat memorys.  Disks are always divided into five parts:<ol><li>boot block, which contains information to boot the system</li><li>superblock, which specified boundaries of next areas and contains head of freelists of inodes and file blocks</li><li>i-node area, which contains descriptors for each file on disk</li><li>file contents area, the head of which is in the super-block, and the</li><li>swap area, which holds processes which have been swapped out of memory.</li></ol><br />An i-node is a data structure traditional to a Unix-style file system, and basically stores all the information about a regular file, directory, or file system object, other than its data and name.  Each file in a file system correspondes to one i-node.  I-nodes also contain a &#8220;block list,&#8221; in the form of 13 block pointers, 10 of which are &#8220;direct pointers&#8221; to a block of data corresponding to a file.  The last 3 are pointers to pointers.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_-IcQmBgdJQ/TXCzs3P_nAI/AAAAAAAAAJU/1kKKk4i5l4E/s1600/inodes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="174" width="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_-IcQmBgdJQ/TXCzs3P_nAI/AAAAAAAAAJU/1kKKk4i5l4E/s320/inodes.jpg" /></a></div><br />I-nodes and file blocks are both cached in memory, only forced to be written to disk when the command &#8220;sync&#8221; is called by the operating system (every couple seconds).  If the computer crashes or has a power failure (i.e. you get frustrated with your computer and do a hard reset), you can have an inconsistent disk.  So, avoid hard resets!<br /><br />To make sure flat file systems are consistent, ask yourself: Does each block belong precisely to one file, or else is it free?  If you&#8217;re looking at the consistency of a directory structure, do all the directories form a tree, and do the number of inodes equal the number of directories you&#8217;ll find if you start crawling through all of them?<br /><br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">Journaling File Systems</span><br />So in light of the fact that crashes can and probably will happen when something is being written to disk, how do you make sure stuff stays consistent?  Here is where OS takes a lot of ideas from databases, specifically, atomicity and logs.  <strong>Atomicity</strong> is when you ensure that an action/set of actions are executed completely and perfectly, or else not at all.  <strong>Logs</strong> are a record of the actions that you&#8217;ve done to date.<br /><br /><strong>Journaling file systems</strong> are a special (yet dated to the 80s) type of file system which takes a advantage of redo logs.  The general idea is:<ul><li>always have a &#8220;home copy&#8221; of your data in a consistent/up-to-date state</li><li>make updates persistent by writing them in order to a &#8220;journal&#8221; partition or file on disk</li><li>at your leisure, push updates to the home copies to free up space in the journal</li><li>make sure that you&#8217;ve written a record of your action to your log before updating the disk</li></ul><br />Once an action/transaction has been &#8220;committed&#8221; to the log, you know for sure that you want it on disk.  So, if you crash, recover your log and redo all of the actions that you did there.  This fixes the problem that you might have committed something &#8211; i.e. intended to write it to the disk &#8211; but ran into a problem before you were actually able to write to disk.  Redo logs are the easiest type of log to implement.  <br /><br />Once you&#8217;ve got a log of your &#8220;committed&#8221; data, you can have another thread walk through it and flush items to disk.  Once an item has been flushed, it can be deleted from the log.<br /><br />The problem with the log is that it&#8217;s one, big contiguous write &#8211; so though it&#8217;s efficient, it is another I/O, so it&#8217;s really costly performance-wise.  Thus, journaling file systems can improve performance and make recovery really efficient, but isn&#8217;t worth it in a really busy system.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sources:<br />lecture 14 notes<br />Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-node">inode</a></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;m working on the last OS project, using windbg, and the kernel keeps crashing due to something that looks like<br /><br /><pre class="brush:cpp">*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for mssmbios.sys<br />*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for fltmgr.sys - <br />*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for SHELL32.dll - <br />*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for USER32.dll - <br />*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for COMCTL32.dll - <br />*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for comdlg32.dll - <br />*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for NOTEPAD.EXE<br />*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for kernel32.dll - <br />Probably caused by : fltmgr.sys ( fltmgr!FltProcessFileLock+2049 )<br /></pre><br />I had trouble with symbol files in my previous OS project so finally decided to look them up.<br /><br />A symbol file contains debugging information, which is normally stored separate from the compiled executable to limit the size of the executable, as well as to save disk storage and reduce the time it takes to load the data.  This also makes it so that an executable can be distributed without some essential information which would make it easier for people to reverse engineer it.  Another thing that keeping debugging information separate allowed was to allow incremental linking of debug versions of programs; since the linker and integrated debugger could now use separate PDBs during debugging, the linker has less work to do.<br /><br />Concerning all modern Microsoft compilers (Visual C++ 1.0 and later), that separate file for the debugging information is called a <i>program database</i> (.pdb) file.  PDB files are created when an executable is built, given you&#8217;ve directed your build tools appropriately.<br /><br />In this case, the symbol file for some module couldn&#8217;t be found, which means what caused the crash was third-party software that didn&#8217;t have its symbols listed in a PDB.  If you had a crash, you can type <code>!analyze -v</code> in the kernel debugger window, which will show you a lot of verbose information, including the contents of the stack.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kIaAvrF3BzM/TWxT24ESLPI/AAAAAAAAAI8/2OtdPaREX-M/s1600/kernelverbose.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kIaAvrF3BzM/TWxT24ESLPI/AAAAAAAAAI8/2OtdPaREX-M/s400/kernelverbose.png" width="387" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh, look.&nbsp; the stack</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I&#8217;ve underlined the names of the modules in the stack in red.

<span class="sig">Disk Geometry Definitions</span><br />So now we&#8217;re learning about disks (which I always end up spelling as &#8220;discs&#8221; somehow) as well as file systems.<br /><br />Some pertinent disk parts (which I always forget the definition of):<ul><li>the disk&#8217;s data is stored on concentric bands called <strong>tracks</strong>; tracks are more densely populated with data at the center of the disk than on the other edges (to ensure that a <strike>discked</strike> fixed amount of data can be read in a constant time, despite disk surface speed moving fast on the outer tracks)</li><li>tracks are divided into sections called <strong>sectors</strong>, which are the smallest unit of physical storage on the disk; the data size of a sector is always a power of two, and almost always 512 bytes</li><li>a <strong>cluster</strong> is what the Windows NT file systems use to allocate storage; a cluster is one or more contiguous sectors.</li></ul><br />As a file is written to the disk, the file system decides the appropriate number of clusters needed to store the file&#8217;s data.  For instance, if each cluster is 512 bytes and the file being written is 800 bytes, then two clusters are allocated for the file.  If the file size changes later, then more clusters are allocated to that file.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">One type of file system: File Allocation Table (FAT)</span><br />So, a file system is a method of storing and organizing files and data on a computer.  Essentially, a file system organizes the files into a database so that the operating system can organize, manipulate, and retrieve them.<br /><br />Some basic differences (between FAT and NTFS file systems):<ul><li>The FAT file system can only use 16 bits for the cluster number, which means that volumes using the FAT format of file system can be larger than 65,535 sectors</li><li>Because of the overhead in the FAT file system, it&#8217;s not good for volumes larger than 511 MB (wait, isn&#8217;t this&#8230;all volumes nowadays?;;)</li><li>FAT is a better choice than NTFS for volumes that are smaller than ~400-500 MBs though, because of the disk overhead in NTFS.  I guess that&#8217;s the tradeoff</li><li>FAT file systems can be used with operating systems other than Windows NT, i.e. Windows 95, MS-DOS, etc.</li><li>FAT is simpler</li><li>FAT folder size is smaller for an equal number of files</li><li>FAT has no controls regarding whether a user can access a file or folder, which means the system doesn&#8217;t need to check permissions for an individual file or user, to see if the user has access to the file.  But Windows NT operating systems will have to check if a file is read-only anyway, whether it&#8217;s FAT or NTFS, which is why FAT may provide faster access to files in this respect</li></ul><br />FAT is a simple file system that was originally designed for small disks and simple folder structures. A FAT-formatted volume is allocated in clusters, the size of which is determined by the size of the volume, which must fit in 16 bits and must be a power of 2.<br /><br />FAT is named for the file allocation table, which lives at the beginning of a FAT-formatted volume.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jw8lKfAxw60/TWX-0tUJQVI/AAAAAAAAAIs/9T9URTfof_c/s1600/FATvolume.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="62" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jw8lKfAxw60/TWX-0tUJQVI/AAAAAAAAAIs/9T9URTfof_c/s320/FATvolume.jpg" /></a></div><br />What do all of these areas do?  <strong>FAT1</strong> and <strong>FAT2</strong> contain the file allocation table, which contains information about a cluster on the volume, specifically whether that cluster is:<ul><li>unused</li><li>a cluster in use by a file</li><li>a bad cluster</li><li>the last cluster in a file</li></ul><br />The <strong>root folder</strong> contains an entry for each file and folder on the root.  The only difference between the root folder and other folders is that the root folder is in a specified location on the disk, and has a fixed size.  (On a hard disk, the size is 512 entries; on a floppy disk, it depends on the size of the floppy.)<br /><br />For every file and folder contained in a folder (as directories are really just a special type of file), there is a 32-byte entry, which contains the following information:<ul><li>name (eight-plus-three characters)</li><li>attribute byte (8 bits)</li><li>create time (24 bits)</li><li>create date (16 bits)</li><li>last access date (16 bits)</li><li>last modified time (16 bits)</li><li>last modified date (16 bits)</li><li>starting cluster number in the file allocation table (16 bits)</li><li>file size (32 bits)</li></ul><br />As for the FAT folder structure, there is no real organization &#8211; when a new file comes in, it is placed in the first available location on the volume.  The &#8221;<strong>starting cluster number</strong>&#8221; is the address of the first cluster used by the file.  Each cluster points to the next cluster used in the file, or else to a terminating cluster that signals the end of the file.<br /><br />Since all entries in a folder are the same size, the <strong>attribute byte</strong> for each entry in a folder describes what kind of entry it is: one bit indicating that it&#8217;s a subfolder, another bit marking the entry as a volume label, etc.  The OS controls the settings of these bits.  The user can control four other attribute bits, which indicate the entry is an archive file, system file, hidden file, and/or read-only file.<br /><br /><br /><br />More later.<br /><br /><br />Sources:<br />Microsoft TechNet: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc750198.aspx">Disk and File System Basics</a>, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc750355.aspx">Choosing a File System</a><br />Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">File system</a></div>
