<span class="sig">What&#8217;s so cool about memory management anyway bro</span><br />So unlike way back when in the time of punchcards &amp; etc., we use computers which are capable of <strong>multiprogramming</strong>, a feature of which is the ability to have multiple processes and jobs in memory all at once.<br /><br />We&#8217;ve already looked at ways that an operating system&#8217;s <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/01/operating-systems-notes-chapter-5-cpu.html">processing power</a> can be utilized effectively when you have many different processes executing simultaneously, but how can memory &#8211; also a scarce resource in a computer &#8211; be distributed across processes?  The goal of memory management is to <strong>maximize memory utilization and system throughput</strong>.<br /><br />You also have to make sure that you can manage memory so as to:<br /><ol><li><strong>Protect</strong>: that is, make sure processes execute in isolation, so they don&#8217;t interfere with each other</li><li><strong>Translate fast</strong>: that is, make sure that memory lookups are speedy despite the fact that protection kind of slows stuff down</li><li><strong>Context switch fast</strong>: that is, make sure memory hardware is updated when old processes are removed from the CPU and new processes are given to it</li></ol><br />On a hardware level, when you&#8217;re dealing with memory, you&#8217;re really messing around with <strong>base registers</strong> and <strong>limit registers</strong>.   Base registers contain the address of a start of a program,  and limit registers contain the length of the program.  Both of these things define the scope of a program&#8217;s memory.<br /><br />Programs get their code and data loaded into memory so that they can be run in processes.  It&#8217;s important to keep the memory that processes use separate, so that they don&#8217;t interfere with each other, overwriting the other program&#8217;s code and making it crash and such.  The memory that a program has is allocated is called its <strong>address space</strong>.  In the olden days, if a program couldn&#8217;t fit into memory, then you&#8217;d have to manually overwrite parts of the code that you weren&#8217;t using presently.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">Virtual Memory</span><br />Virtual memory is an abstraction provided by the operating system for memory management.  Thanks to virtual memory, we can do cool things like:<br /><ul><li>allow programs to execute even if their entire address space isn&#8217;t in physical memory</li><li>let programs execute with less RAM than they really &#8220;need&#8221;</li><li>isolate processes from each other so that they can&#8217;t name addresses that other processes can use</li></ul>This is mainly because programs don&#8217;t really use all of the code that they&#8217;re written with &#8211; for instance, a program with if-statements will either execute one branch of the if-statement or the other, and there&#8217;s no real need to allocate space for code that isn&#8217;t run.<br /><br />On a hardware level, virtual memory relies on translation-lookaside buffers (TLB&#8217;s), page tables, page fault handling&#8230;you&#8217;ll also need to deal with swapping and segmentation.  <strong>Swapping</strong> is the memory-equivalent of context switching for processing power.  When you do a context switch between processes, you remove the old process from using CPU and allocate that CPU to the new process; in swapping, you remove memory from the previous process and give it to the new one.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">Virtual Addresses</span><br />So, this whole time when we&#8217;ve been talking about how <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/01/operating-systems-notes-chapter-2-3.html">a process consists of an address space</a> (along with at least one thread and OS resources), what we&#8217;ve really meant is that processes have a set of <strong>virtual addresses</strong>.  Once more: a process&#8217;s address space is its set of virtual addresses.<br /><br />And what are virtual addresses?  They are the layer of abstraction between a process and physical memory.  When the CPU executes instructions from a loaded program, it uses the virtual addresses for pointers, arguments to load and store instructions, and so on.  Virtual addresses must be translated by hardware into physical addresses, the actual location of the data stored on disk.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KotutHv0Kkk/TVTbDb2stkI/AAAAAAAAAGE/c_t2mc_tACA/s1600/viraddr1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="226" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KotutHv0Kkk/TVTbDb2stkI/AAAAAAAAAGE/c_t2mc_tACA/s320/viraddr1.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so, here we&#8217;ve got: process p&#8217;s pointer, which points to a virtual address in p&#8217;s address space. &nbsp;that in turn points to a physical address in physical memory.  the physical address is what points to the actual data.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><span class="sig">How do you translate virtual addresses into physical addresses?</span><br />Virtual addresses (in the process address space) and physical addresses (on disk) don&#8217;t correspond exactly to each other &#8211; that is, a virtual address in space 0 doesn&#8217;t necessarily point to a physical address in space 0.  So, how does a virtual address translate to a physical address?<br /><br />To translate in the olden days, the physical memory would be partitioned, in one of two ways:<br /><ol><li><strong>Fixed partitions.</strong>  The physical memory would be broken up into fixed-size partitions, so that the physical address could be obtained by adding the virtual address and the base register.  When a context switch happened, a new base register would be loaded.  This was a simple way of doing things but has <strong>fragmentation problems</strong> &#8211; both <strong>internal fragmentation</strong> (which happens when the physical memory partition is larger than what the program needs) and <strong>external fragmentation</strong> (which happens when you may have two small partitions remaining, and one large job which won&#8217;t fit into each separately).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ty-M47nOJzo/TVTdQWMAdkI/AAAAAAAAAGM/ftBjaeeoabo/s1600/viraddr2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="203" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ty-M47nOJzo/TVTdQWMAdkI/AAAAAAAAAGM/ftBjaeeoabo/s320/viraddr2.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">with fixed partitions,<br />physical address = virtual address + base register<br />the limit register check is to make sure you don&#8217;t overstep physical memory</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li><strong>Variable partitions.</strong> In this case, the physical memory would be broken up into variable-size partitions, the size dependant on the program.  Again, the physical address is equal to the virtual address plus the base register.  Variable partitioning <strong>fixes internal fragmentation</strong>, since you won&#8217;t allocate more than a program needs and therefore waste space that other programs could use &#8211; <strong>but you still have external fragmentation</strong>, because as you load and unload jobs, holes are left scattered behind.  (This is slightly different than external fragmentation in fixed partition systems.)<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4zihtB6CQNQ/TVTeWbpF6jI/AAAAAAAAAGU/0-y3xwKJIkI/s1600/viraddr3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="245" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4zihtB6CQNQ/TVTeWbpF6jI/AAAAAAAAAGU/0-y3xwKJIkI/s320/viraddr3.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">with variable partitions,<br />physical address = virtual address + base register<br />the limit register makes sure you don&#8217;t overstep memory<br />the black parts denote unused holes in the memory 3:</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ol><br /><br />One way to deal with external fragmentation is to be like,<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iVkxoUAgHa0/TVTfpWKPs_I/AAAAAAAAAGc/5ngILCCIYpQ/s1600/viraddr4.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="234" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iVkxoUAgHa0/TVTfpWKPs_I/AAAAAAAAAGc/5ngILCCIYpQ/s320/viraddr4.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />and basically push all the allocated physical memory together.  Which is bad because you have to do this manually and like, all the time.<br /><br />So, a better way to do things in general is to be like, PAGES, BRO.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-29MhcnKDPZQ/TVTf8yOllPI/AAAAAAAAAGk/xqYlIwU95HQ/s1600/viraddr5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="250" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-29MhcnKDPZQ/TVTf8yOllPI/AAAAAAAAAGk/xqYlIwU95HQ/s320/viraddr5.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">PAGES. &nbsp;YE</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><span class="sig">Pages and Page Tables</span><br />So with pages, processes view their address space as some memory ranging from indexes 0 to N, but in reality the mapping of those address spaces to physical addresses points every which way all over the disk.  The program doesn&#8217;t know this at all, and isolation is still provided to all program&#8217;s because a program still can&#8217;t reference memory outside of its virtual address space.<br /><br />So.  A virtual address is comprised of a virtual page number (VPN), as well as some offset.  A physical address is comprised of a page frame number (PFN), as well as some offset.  Now, to translate from a virtual address to a physical address, you need to divide the address space into equal-sized &#8220;pages,&#8221; and then use one more thing: the <strong>page table</strong>.  The page table contains the mapping between a virtual address&#8217;s VPN and a physical address&#8217;s PFN, and this is how a program with a virtual address can access physical memory, memory on disk.  Once more, for good measure: a page table maps a <em>virtual address page</em> to a <em>physical page frame</em>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TVThyWocAlI/AAAAAAAAAGs/cQVcDkDCC0U/s1600/viraddr6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="215" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TVThyWocAlI/AAAAAAAAAGs/cQVcDkDCC0U/s320/viraddr6.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">it&#8217;s easy, right?</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Page tables contain <strong>page table entries (PTEs)</strong>, which look something like this:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TVTiaKBOuiI/AAAAAAAAAG0/EutComkh8Jg/s1600/viraddr7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="91" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TVTiaKBOuiI/AAAAAAAAAG0/EutComkh8Jg/s320/viraddr7.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><ul><li>the <strong>valid bit</strong> says whether or not this PTE can be used &#8211; that is, whether or not the virtual address is valid, meaning it actually maps to some physical address, which points to a location in physical memory.</li><li>the <strong>referenced bit</strong> says whether the page has been accessed &#8211; that is, whether it&#8217;s been read from or written to at all</li><li>the <strong>modified bit</strong> says whether or not the page is dirty, meaning a write has occurred to that page</li><li>the <strong>protection bits</strong> control which operations (read, write, execute, etc.) are allowed to be used on this page</li><li>and finally, the PFN determines the &#8220;physical page,&#8221; the location in physical memory that the given virtual address points to.  Like how a base register contains the starting address of a process&#8217;s virtual address space, a physical page&#8217;s start address is determined by the PFN.</li></ul><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IjOgv0A9WCU/TVTurOC7yJI/AAAAAAAAAHE/1vfxhYR5OlA/s1600/viraddr9.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IjOgv0A9WCU/TVTurOC7yJI/AAAAAAAAAHE/1vfxhYR5OlA/s320/viraddr9.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">here&#8217;s the picture from earlier without the page table photoshopped out of it</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><strong>The great thing about paging</strong> is that makes it easy to allocate physical memory to a program &#8211; physical memory is now ordered in a list of frames, and when you want to allocate it, just remove it from the list of &#8220;free&#8221; frames.  This solves external fragmentation and all the troublesome-ness of managing the holes left behind from loading and unloading programs.<br /><br />And, it lends itself naturally to <strong>virtual memory</strong>, because a program doesn&#8217;t need to be completely resident in the memory anymore &#8211; only partially, only the parts that you care about right now (or soon).  If it so happens that you need code that is not presently in memory (which you&#8217;ll know, because when you use a virtual address to access something not in memory, the valid bit in the PTE will cry out), you take a <strong>page fault</strong>, and the code or data that you need will be brought into memory.<br /><br />Remaining problems: internal fragmentation, since a process still may not use memory in exact multiples of pages.  Also, there&#8217;s a great overhead in referencing anything, since instead of accessing that thing directly, you&#8217;re making two look-ups, first through the page table, and then into physical memory itself.  <span class="shh">(This can be solved with TLBs &#8211; more on that later.)</span><br /><br />The other problem: page tables can be huge.  Consider that each process has its own address space, which means you need one page table entry per page in the address space.  Operating systems typically have separate page tables per process, and things can get huge fast.  The solution to this is to&#8230;page the page tables lol.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">And yet another way to translate virtual addresses into physical addresses: segmentation</span><br />To do segmentation, partition not the physical memory, but the address spaces, into logical units: one partition for stack, one for code, one for the heap, one for subroutines&#8230;<br /><br />A virtual address that is a part of this address space will then consist of a <strong>segment number</strong> and an <strong>offset</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>The good thing about this: it&#8217;s more logical</strong>, since without segmentation, what the linker does during compilation is take a bunch of modules that call each other and linearizes them.  These modules are all independent and are treated that way when the address space is segmented.  Segmentation is also a natural extension of variable-sized partitions; where there&#8217;s one variable partition per process, there&#8217;s many segments per process.  Segmentation also facilitates sharing and reuse of code.<br /><br /><strong>Disadvantages: just like a variable partition system, segmentation can have all the horrific external fragmentation, even if linking is simpler.</strong><br /><br />On a hardware level, you would need a segment table with multiple base/limit register pairs, one per segment in the address space.  The physical address would be yielded by adding the virtual address offset to the base address of the segment.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TVTsVUM3gXI/AAAAAAAAAG8/rfJKLzVUE18/s1600/viraddr8.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="238" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TVTsVUM3gXI/AAAAAAAAAG8/rfJKLzVUE18/s320/viraddr8.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Anyway, to fix the problem that segmentation has with external fragmentation, you can mix segmentation and paging.  Use segments to manage logical units, and then use paging to partition segments into fixed-size chunks.  Each segment will have its own page table (rather than there being one page table per address space), and memory allocation once again becomes easy and cool, without external fragmentation problems.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sources:<br />lecture 10 notes<br /><a href="http://www.science-dictionary.com/definition/base-register.html">Science-Dictionary: base register</a><br /><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090520065552AAOWEvZ">Yahoo Answers: Base and limit register?</a><br />section 5 notes</div>
