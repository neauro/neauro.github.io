But beauty comes with a hidden price tag. Is Sara willing to pay?</i></blockquote><br />I was happy to rediscover Sara&#8217;s Face in one of my tubs of books in the garage. It&#8217;s a book that I scavenged from some many hundreds expelled from the city library, and I decided it was mine after I read the words <i>face transplant</i>.<br /><br />The book is written as if by a novelist playing the role of a journalist. He or she dissects the grosteque and still-mysterious events surrounding Jonathan Heat, an aging rockstar invested in his looks, and Sara Carter, a 17-year-old girl who wants to become famous, in a Manic-Pixie-Dream-Girl sort of way. <br /><br /><blockquote><i>It&#8217;s like, when people look at you and think, </i>Oh, she&#8217;s smaller than in real life,<i> because, see, actually, you&#8217;re not real life. It&#8217;s when people start talking to you in the street or on the bus because they think they know you, but they never even met you, or like you&#8217;ve got some secret they want to know but they never can. Like you&#8217;re a blessing. There&#8217;s something about you that inspires them to be more than themselves. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s what I want to be. Just like that.</i></blockquote><br />The book is written as if the event&#8217;s conclusion has already been well-disseminated amongst its fictional UK populace, and in some ways, you as the reader can have some very well-founded suspicions of What Happens at the End as well. Does that mean that the book isn&#8217;t exciting? I once read a blog post about writing (which I can&#8217;t find at the moment) which stated that, No, just knowing the ending isn&#8217;t enough to spoil the story; and in fact, sometimes knowing it full-out keeps you crawling toward it like a desperate person. &#8220;Have you ever heard of the time that I got shot?&#8221; Person X might say, and upon you replying, <i>No! Tell me about it,</i> Person X might answer, &#8220;Well, I wasn&#8217;t actually shot, but I certainly got you interested.&#8221;<br /><br />So &#8211; you kinda sorta maybe know what&#8217;s going to happen &#8211; kinda sorta? Maybe? Even so, I was engrossed in the proceedings as if they were happening &#8220;now,&#8221; as if the characters recounting their actions still had no idea what was going to happen. Every character offered in the story is meaningful, and full of motivation, action, and regret. The writing is easy to digest, straightforward, and full of punch. It takes only a couple sentences to understand who a character is.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>I need new tits. I need a whole new body, actually. I tell you, I get fatter when I&#8217;m dieting. I get fat just by breathing. I can turn air into fat. It&#8217;s a gift I have.</i></blockquote><br />Though the book is supposed to have been written by &#8220;a journalist,&#8221; occasionally things are portrayed with novelist-like omniscience:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>There was another huge bang, a bellow as if the Minotaur himself was coming, and then a man&#8217;s voice speaking out urgently but low, the words too blurred to make out. Then, there came the sound of a girl suddenly screaming in pain. It was truly dreadful, a cawing, screeching noise that [Sara] understood was coming from a pretty young throat.</i></blockquote><br />In this scene, only Sara is able to hear the screaming, and Sara hasn&#8217;t told her story to the journalist yet at this point; so why does the journalist detail it? For me, these small strangenesses were only very small bumps in the road; overall the book kept me ravenous to learn What Happens Next, and it was only grudgingly that I put it away to get some sleep, only to pick it up again at 6am to finish it.</div>
