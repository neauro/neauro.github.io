I loved <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/10/bastion-logtistical-est.html">Bastion</a> and I'm super super super excited for <i>Transistor</i>, because it has a female protagonist with curly hair. <i>Curly hair!</i><br /><br />(Or at the very least, <i>wavy hair!</i>)<br /><br />I was not keen on attending PAX this year until I found a friend selling tickets and my compulsion to hoard scarce resources broke through my skepticism of the event. I first went in 2009 and stopped out of boredom and <a href="http://debacle.tumblr.com/">discomfort</a>, but decided I'd give this year another try, not because I think trivializing rape is okay (I <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/genesis-2.html">don't</a>) but because I wanted to see if the environment has changed since <a href="http://www.feministfrequency.com/2013/06/full-ign-interview-with-anita-sarkeesian/">Tropes Vs Women</a>. I also really, really, <i>really</i> wanted to see <i>Transistor</i>.<br /><br />Since I got my tickets late, I started cosplay work only about a month before PAX started, which also happened to be right in the swing of summer quarter. Making the sword was fun and challenging, mostly because it was my first time working with plastic. First I made some sketches and then a model using some leftover foam from my <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2013/04/sakura-con-2013-cosplay-black-rock.html">Strength cosplay</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uP3HTT7dTS4/Uif_sQSC7DI/AAAAAAAAD-s/487Li4QQ4lc/s1600/sketch.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="482" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uP3HTT7dTS4/Uif_sQSC7DI/AAAAAAAAD-s/487Li4QQ4lc/s640/sketch.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">such cosplay wow</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then I visited <a href="http://www.tapplastics.com/">TAP Plastics</a> and after beating around the bush I admitted that I was making a giant sword. Turns out the guy staffing was also a cosplayer and happy to give me advice, which I desperately needed. I had my heart set on a blue-y transparent plastic, which they didn't have, but he explained that if I painted on the backside of clear plastic, <em>it would look like a mirror</em>…and that sounded great! I got a couple samples of green-edge acrylic and tried out a couple different paint colors on it.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lo5wfmiMpD4/Uif_5u8R3wI/AAAAAAAAD-0/S4caFilJwac/s1600/paint+test.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="290" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lo5wfmiMpD4/Uif_5u8R3wI/AAAAAAAAD-0/S4caFilJwac/s640/paint+test.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i was so bright-eyed then</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A pointed out that what would really make the sword striking would be a strong contrast between the base color and "solder lines," so for the base color I decided on using a lot of green to really make the inner lines stand out.<br /><br />Then I visited TAP Plastics to get the pieces cut, and at the last moment decided I wanted not just half an inch thickness of plastic, but a whole inch. Imagine my shock and horror when I realized that such a width of plastic is actually heavy. Like, <em>really</em> heavy. (I don't have a scale, but a friend's estimate when he picked up the final product and grimaced was 35 lbs, so I'm going with that number.)<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8SxFDzB53F0/UigAxKgvILI/AAAAAAAAD-8/e-Q0WPJRfeA/s1600/heavy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="531" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8SxFDzB53F0/UigAxKgvILI/AAAAAAAAD-8/e-Q0WPJRfeA/s640/heavy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">heavy, but still not as unwieldy as strength arms</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My plan was to do a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_glass_painting">reverse painting</a> deal on both sides of the sword and then sandwich them together. I used masking tape to copy out my drawn pattern on both sides, and first painted in the solder lines with a mixture of paints: pearly blue, shiny white, and glow-in-the-dark!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eD85Y44KYCU/UigDLfD2H_I/AAAAAAAAD_Q/sqjs_uu_nhI/s1600/painting.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eD85Y44KYCU/UigDLfD2H_I/AAAAAAAAD_Q/sqjs_uu_nhI/s640/painting.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">left photo courtesy of <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I didn't get to see the glow paint in action, unfortunately, and the fact that it's sort of thick and grainy made me nervous that the plastic pieces would stick together properly when pressed together.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HOuHj5pMteQ/UigFL3SxDwI/AAAAAAAAD_c/pxT8F5MNiZI/s1600/peel+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="478" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HOuHj5pMteQ/UigFL3SxDwI/AAAAAAAAD_c/pxT8F5MNiZI/s640/peel+montage.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">peeling the tape off was <i>so satisfying</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I had two circular pieces of plastic that I wanted to attach to the outside of the sword for the Transistor's red "eye," but there's also a sort of depression/border around the eye. I realized that in my limited time I wouldn't be able to do anything three-dimensional for that border, so I decided to just paint another blue circle.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kei6SIadyXw/UigHA-lNSkI/AAAAAAAAD_o/yicAVzmckIU/s1600/circle.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="489" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kei6SIadyXw/UigHA-lNSkI/AAAAAAAAD_o/yicAVzmckIU/s640/circle.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dry dry dry! (also there's A, because i need another picture to even this out)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Meanwhile, the eye got the same "reverse painting" treatment.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yemSRp3_suM/UigH1_cWiEI/AAAAAAAAD_w/GZqDWc-Bgcg/s1600/eye+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yemSRp3_suM/UigH1_cWiEI/AAAAAAAAD_w/GZqDWc-Bgcg/s640/eye+montage.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i see you</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Once the solder lines were done, I combined green-y metallic paint and blue metallic paint and painted that down across both pieces.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WPj04DrWiJ0/UigIDnuiGtI/AAAAAAAAEAA/CsjwKL-x1eA/s1600/base+color.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WPj04DrWiJ0/UigIDnuiGtI/AAAAAAAAEAA/CsjwKL-x1eA/s640/base+color.jpg" width="425" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">such contrast</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Since I was swamped with making the actual costume, A helped out with the handle and cutting out what we referred to as the "top fins" and "side fins" from plywood. Because the plastic turned out to be so heavy, and because we were pressed for time, we left the handle rectangular, rather than shaved down to the canon cylinder.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AOFidkP7444/UigIgs5iDyI/AAAAAAAAEAI/U6O5SE2-dQ0/s1600/DSC_0275.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AOFidkP7444/UigIgs5iDyI/AAAAAAAAEAI/U6O5SE2-dQ0/s640/DSC_0275.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">plywood fins</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After that, with his father's help, A and I clamped the two pieces together in a vise and drilled holes through the wood and plastic! Again not canon, but the pieces were <em>such heavy wow, </em>and needed that extra reinforcement.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ36fytFm70/UigJlaSW8uI/AAAAAAAAEAU/4XrID4GWUV4/s1600/drill+montage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ36fytFm70/UigJlaSW8uI/AAAAAAAAEAU/4XrID4GWUV4/s640/drill+montage.jpg" width="508" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so close!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After drilling, we had planned to take the sword apart and touch up the paint a bit, but…after all the clamping, the two pieces of plastic ended up <em>completely stuck together</em>. So much for worrying about it coming apart.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lFnXTGExgtY/UigJylAc8dI/AAAAAAAAEAc/CemsLFy3qgo/s1600/plywood.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lFnXTGExgtY/UigJylAc8dI/AAAAAAAAEAc/CemsLFy3qgo/s640/plywood.jpg" width="424" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the light does cool shading tricks through the plastic</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The last thing to be built was the pommel, which A flashed out overnight. I have no pictures of it, but it was made out of some plastic canisters and a plastic soysauce dish hot-glued together and painted over. Cosplay at its finest. :')<br /><br />Finally, what was left was to paint the plywood pieces, and then glue on the red eye. A also put on some electrical tape to make the side fins appear more indented, but the tape near-immediately fell off during peace-bonding. Ah well!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2tCzKsrHSt8/UigKzHyNehI/AAAAAAAAEAk/mjFAjlJXg7g/s1600/finalish+montage+copy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="456" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2tCzKsrHSt8/UigKzHyNehI/AAAAAAAAEAk/mjFAjlJXg7g/s640/finalish+montage+copy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">done!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />As for the dress itself…I reused the racer-back tank pattern I made for the Strength cosplay, though I made it longer and added a kind of cape for the sleeves. I wanted to sew the jacket as well but ran out of time and ended up compromising by sewing a satin triangle to a long black jacket I found at a consignment store a couple days before PAX. The last thing I did was the feather collar, which I made by sewing feathers into leftover Strength felt and sewing it around the dress's neck.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v5pXoNDFlwg/UigLYHBNKzI/AAAAAAAAEAs/YCIBxAQnyKw/s1600/DSC_0293.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v5pXoNDFlwg/UigLYHBNKzI/AAAAAAAAEAs/YCIBxAQnyKw/s640/DSC_0293.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">feathers!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />On the day before PAX I also quicked out the triangular ring from Sculpey (also left over from Strength cosplay; thank goodness I can reuse so much stuff) and acrylic paint.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TsVv3uZLfkA/UigL1ImNGlI/AAAAAAAAEA0/6du08qR3d88/s1600/IMG_6350+copy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TsVv3uZLfkA/UigL1ImNGlI/AAAAAAAAEA0/6du08qR3d88/s640/IMG_6350+copy.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">photo by <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Sooo overall…though there are a couple things I want to re-do for the next round (including remaking the feather collar and ring), I finished a new cosplay and am proud of my new forays into the world of plastic! PAX itself was fun in and of itself; I was really happy to finally play Transistor, and even more excited for it once I actually played and recognized all the programming nods. I was a little bewildered by the inclusion of the "stop time and attack" thing, until I realized it was <em>so thematic</em> — since the Transistor's atacks are sort of like methods, "stopping time" to queue up attacks and execute them really mirrors compiling programs. <i>Uwaaa.</i><br /><br />I was also surprised and happy to see so many cool Reds at PAX, many of whom had taken the extra leap to use ~*electricity*~! I briefly ran into the Red from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Breakers-Cosplay/419407924815813">Breakers Cosplay</a> who was super impressive and inspiring. I also met a lot of progressive dudes and women who specifically talked about how awesome it is to have A Female Protagonist in a game (something I don't think I would have <em>never</em> heard anyone say flat-out in years past), and a lot of friendly people in general who gamely attempted holding my Transistor and remarked at how they admired my ridiculousness for carrying it around all day at the convention, haha. To be fair, my arms were really sore afterward, but all my rock climbing callouses helped out quite a bit!<br /><br />My favorite moment in all of PAX was to meet Jen Zee, who was so awesome and kind and asked for pictures in which I tried desperately to look cool despite my euphoria. She also gave me a ton of Supergiant swag that I placed all around my house immediately. :')<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uIlReuprg1U/UigMVP6jKFI/AAAAAAAAEA8/kw8k9oCPExI/s1600/DSC_0306.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uIlReuprg1U/UigMVP6jKFI/AAAAAAAAEA8/kw8k9oCPExI/s1600/DSC_0306.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i christen thee, supergiant wall</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There was also a magical instant where A and I, passing curiously by the Paramount, suddenly realized that Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett were performing and dashed inside as quickly as possible and caught <i>the Transistor song</i>!<br /><br />All this being said, I had a great weekend, mostly due to the friends and people I was able to meet. I don't think I feel comfortable enough to return again (because <a href="http://shoshanakessock.com/2013/09/04/pax-youve-gone-and-done-it-an-open-letter/">reasons</a>), but I am thankful for my personal experience this year.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CWR-fH-wYac/UigQ5IFyy7I/AAAAAAAAEBI/GzPz6mXRg3s/s1600/1240322_10151588009897060_1663051843_n_1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="534" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CWR-fH-wYac/UigQ5IFyy7I/AAAAAAAAEBI/GzPz6mXRg3s/s640/1240322_10151588009897060_1663051843_n_1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">especially for time runnin around with <a href="http://couchcrusader-art.tumblr.com/">couch</a>!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And finally, now that both my summer quarter classes and PAX are completely finished, I am free!<br /><br />…and ready to devote myself to a new project! Maybe something for the <a href="http://towerjam.tumblr.com/post/59682821300/welcome-to-tower-jam">Tower Jam</a>?</div>

Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by giants. Giants are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source.

Luckily, we discovered an all-purpose primer at an Ace Hardware which a woman added a gray hue to for us, so that we could achieve the dark black we wanted.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4YYWpCHZBDA/UXnxP06TofI/AAAAAAAADiM/pPOSuj5ro00/s1600/DSC_0211.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4YYWpCHZBDA/UXnxP06TofI/AAAAAAAADiM/pPOSuj5ro00/s640/DSC_0211.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">primer time</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It took a couple months to construct, and about a week to paint, and afterward Andou edged out the fingers with silver to give it a metallic look.<br /><br />As for the dress…I had this idea that I would eyeball the entire thing, and this would just <em>not work</em> for the lovely back that this costume has. I ended up trying to eyeball the dress twice before resigning myself to crawling the Internet for patterns. Luckily, I found <a href="http://www.briansews.com/2011/07/how-to-y-back-tank-top.html">a really great tutorial</a> on how to make a "racerback" tank top, and from there it was pretty easy! (Though still time-consuming.)<br /><br />The collar was made out of a piece of foam, which we covered with black fabric and white felt and secured in the back with a plate of cardboard and some screws. (Andou's touch, which I think is awesome.)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gIuRrFlF6ag/UXnx6IU-0iI/AAAAAAAADiY/lhYJp1yAoPs/s1600/smaller.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="478" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gIuRrFlF6ag/UXnx6IU-0iI/AAAAAAAADiY/lhYJp1yAoPs/s640/smaller.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />The tail was the thing that got thrown under the bus this time, as the deadline neared: that was fashioned somewhat crudely from leftover foam covered in masking tape, painted over in black, and sewn to the back of my biking shorts. The tape slowly unraveled throughout Con, but luckily neither it (or the arms!) broke apart entirely, despite my panicking throughout the weekend.<br /><br />Without further ado, here are photos from my group's photoshoot, all taken by the super-talented <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jaymee.masui">Jaymee Masui</a>!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J23HKRd1DIA/UXn1baZL49I/AAAAAAAADjA/CuYZeLMOmsE/s1600/27155_513352652061010_2061205090_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="472" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J23HKRd1DIA/UXn1baZL49I/AAAAAAAADjA/CuYZeLMOmsE/s640/27155_513352652061010_2061205090_n.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">our whole group!</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SGkmfLshdKM/UXn1fuZAX6I/AAAAAAAADjI/3o_KKVMh9rE/s1600/534920_513352595394349_1464377463_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="382" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SGkmfLshdKM/UXn1fuZAX6I/AAAAAAAADjI/3o_KKVMh9rE/s640/534920_513352595394349_1464377463_n.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"group hug"</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-joZwQ1T968Q/UXn1jVyFLOI/AAAAAAAADjQ/UknoWtU7g0A/s1600/733802_513352732061002_890250777_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-joZwQ1T968Q/UXn1jVyFLOI/AAAAAAAADjQ/UknoWtU7g0A/s640/733802_513352732061002_890250777_n.jpg" width="428" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">strength &amp; gold saw, who i am told have a special relationship</td></tr></tbody></table><br />More group photos can be seen at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.513352428727699.1073741826.475899655806310&amp;type=1">Kimidori Cosplay</a>. This was my best cosplay yet, and part of what made it wonderful was the help of Andou with the props, Aubrey with the wig, and my awesome Merch Staff friends. Here's to many years ahead. ^___^<br /><br />Fun fact: the arms were so heavy that I actually gained non-negligible muscle mass over the course of the weekend…haha. And I definitely returned to Real Life on Monday without the ability to raise my (very, very sore) arms over my head.<br /><br />What's next? Well, recently I've been daydreaming about doing Red from Supergiant's upcoming <i>Transistor</i>...we'll see how that goes.</div>

Haha, Andou looks so awesome there with his... *ahem* handiwork. ;)<br /><br />And you look awesome too, of course! Great choice - I&#39;m impressed at how you pulled it off. :)</div>

It occurs to me that I never did update after <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/04/okami-cosplay.html">my previous post on our Okami cosplay</a>.
