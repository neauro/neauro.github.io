<h4 class="ls1">Hello!</h4>
<p>
I'm Nadine. I'm a designer experienced with owning UX design and UX research techniques to explore and bring ideas from early concept to finished, validated feature.  
</p>
<p>I graduated from the University of Washington (B.S. Computer Science, M.S. Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering).</p>

<p>
I design, code, take pictures, draw, write, play with my dog, study Japanese, and a lot of other things. I read a lot (recently, <em>The Dog Merchants</em> and Sayaka MURATA's <em>Convenience Store Woman</em>).
</p>

<p>
I also love video games (recently, <em>Stardew Valley</em>, though I'm extremely very looking forward to the new Animal Crossing!!!).
</p>

<p>
  In general, I enjoy buildings things that are not just fun, but do good by providing a service for people in their everyday lives.
