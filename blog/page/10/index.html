The film is directed by Gary Hustwit. Objectified premiered at the South By Southwest Festival on March 14, 2009. </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectified" via="via" wikipedia="wikipedia">(via Wikipeda)</a></blockquote><br /><i>Objectified </i>has been languishing on my Netflix Instant Queue for the good part of a year or so. I finally watched it, and was glad! The film brings together a variety of designers from Across the World, who all talk about what they personally feel is Good Design. It&#8217;s refreshing to watch designers talk so passionately about chairs and personal marks on the world and shaving away at the superfluous &#8220;fat&#8221; of a toothbrush design until they eliminate the concept of a toothbrush from oral health completely. It&#8217;s amusing to see one designer swear that he&#8217;s always &#8220;lived in the future,&#8221; while another reaches into the past for <a href="http://davebmiller.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/spelunking-the-cell-phone/">a modern cellphone design inspired by childhood memories of peeling potatoes</a>.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />In the end, I was relieved when the movie moved from &#8220;NEW THINGS! Aren&#8217;t they cool? <i>Buy all these new cool things!</i>&#8221; to &#8220;Do we <i>really</i>&nbsp;need new cool things? I mean, just <i>look</i>&nbsp;at all the things that we already have.&#8221;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-20cHlJOlVXQ/UCKyaABIJSI/AAAAAAAAB8Y/f2sKV-TU3qE/s1600/2184_4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-20cHlJOlVXQ/UCKyaABIJSI/AAAAAAAAB8Y/f2sKV-TU3qE/s640/2184_4.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">just&#8230;look at them (<a href="http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Objectified-Blu-ray/6861/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The film points out the great problem of sustainability in product design, how it&#8217;s not just about recycling/upcycling but how sustainability must guide design from before the beginning to beyond the end. <i>Why</i>&nbsp;are you designing this thing? What will it add to the world that doesn&#8217;t already exist? And what will happen to the thing, when someone designs a new thing five seconds later?</div>

Using examples from a range of stores from fashion emporia to supermarkets, the book offers practical advice on the subject, supported by hints and tips from established visual merchandisers. It reveals the secrets of their tool kit, and information on the use of mannequins, the latest technology, how to construct and source props, and explains the psychology behind shopping and buyer behavior. </i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Presented through color photographs, diagrams of floor layouts, and store case studies, and including invaluable information such as a glossary of terms used in the industry, Visual Merchandising is an essential handbook for anyone working in and learning about this exciting area.</i></blockquote><br />This came up as a hit when I searched the public library database for books about stores and merchandising, which I was in turn searching for as a resource for free-to-play game design. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/06/11/154787321/game-maker-stunted-by-facebook-turns-to-mobile">As NPR uncovered</a>, free-to-play games are a lot like stores; you see the nice displays outside, shuffle in and around for a while, and if you discover something that you like, something that will, perhaps, make you feel like a better human being, you pay money to obtain that thing.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.electricrest.com/wordpress/?p=376">Electric Rest</a> details some other possible applications of store design to free-to-play games, and I thought I would try and find some myself.&nbsp;<i>Visual Merchandising </i>turns out to be something of a beautiful textbook, with a history of window displays that in Olden Times (a.k.a. early 1900s) displayed not fashionable&nbsp;manikins, but rotating displays of art and sometimes curiosities (like a plane that had fallen while attempting to cross the Atlantic, and was promptly reassembled in a department store window).<br /><br />With regards to a digital medium, the takeaways are a little harder to come by, though I guess you could force them out. For example, indoor arrangements depend on the store&#8217;s architecture, but there are a couple rules of thumb that help, such as &#8220;shelves that are angled rather than parallel to each other can draw people in to explore.&#8221; Could an interface be designed in such a way that the eye is drawn to viewing other goods for sale, rather than relying on a &#8220;Go to next page&#8221; click? How could you fashion an experience that allows someone to wander aimlessly, yet also not impede them if they want to get directly to Point B?<br /><br />The three-dimensional space and atmosphere afforded by a store can be impactful in ways that I think are hard to mirror to video games, or even shopping websites. There&#8217;s the three-dimensionality, of course, and the impact of sound and other people and smells set to artificially make you feel like you&#8217;re in a warm tropical clothing paradise ripe for bikini buying. Also, even though I&#8217;m sure people are aware of the fact that stores try and push cheap gum and parcels of assorted high fructose corn syrup at you as you&#8217;re paying for your Actual Purchases, I think it&#8217;s easy to write off a lot of store design as &#8220;Oh, they did that just because that&#8217;s the way the store is shaped, not because they&#8217;re <i>trying&nbsp;desperately to sink their hands into my wallet.</i>&#8221; Contrast to perpetual social game pop-ups rewarding you with discounts on virtual goods.<br /><br />Another thing that&nbsp;I believe stores will have going for them for a while is their ability to support social exploration, to serve as a bauble-filled backdrop to people&#8217;s wanderings as they share each other&#8217;s company. I can&#8217;t think of any games that do similar. (Though I suddenly imagine some WoW- or Second Life-esque scenario&#8230;ah, well, you could imagine an MMORPG fitting into <i>any</i> scenario, though.)<br /><br />In short: <i>Visual Merchandising</i> has gorgeous photos, some interesting history and details about things like department stores and manikins, and so on. It also features some ~*famous window displays*~ like the one from Selfridge&#8217;s which has all those inflatable boobs&#8230;what does it look like? Read the book!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div></div>

And even though she could live for a long time (whatever that means), Hazel lives tethered to an oxygen tank, the tumours tenuously kept at bay with a constant chemical assault. <br /><br />Enter Augustus Waters. A match made at cancer kid support group, Augustus is gorgeous, in remission, and shockingly to her, interested in Hazel. Being with Augustus is both an unexpected destination and a long-needed journey, pushing Hazel to re-examine how sickness and health, life and death, will define her and the legacy that everyone leaves behind.</i></blockquote><br />I finished this book in an evening and a morning. It is fantastic. <a href="http://meloukhia.net/2012/03/book_review_the_fault_in_our_stars_by_john_green.html">A review on this ain&#8217;t livin</a>&nbsp;sums it up more nicely than I feel I could: &#8221;<i>The Fault In Our Stars</i> basically took every cancer kid trope and shat on it, hilariously and sensitively and brilliantly.&#8221;<br /><br />s.e. smith continues:<br /><blockquote><i>The Fault In Our Stars</i> is a book that makes cancer funny, that pokes fun at cancer, that points out the absurdity of life and shows you that it’s okay to be, and feel, ridiculous while dealing with chronic illness at the same time that it can also be funny, and frustrating, and enraging, and depressing. It’s a far cry from the usual sombre texts about cancer or the media that suggest cancer patients need to crack jokes for the benefit of the people around them. The dark humour is about insider’s jokes: It’s for people with cancer, not for others. It’s funny if you’ve been chronically ill, and isn’t intended to amuse caregivers and family and friends, although some may well find it funny too.<br /><br />It’s also a book that unflinchingly faces tragedy without turning maudlin and ridiculously sentimental. The Fault In Our Stars points out that the facts of life are often really, really crappy. For a man dedicated to reducing world suck levels, I like that Green pointed out that sometimes, world suck levels are out of our control, and that some of the narratives for dealing with that are deeply unhelpful and unuseful.</blockquote>Sometimes the characters&#8217; dialogue reminded me of something out of <i>Juno, </i>a little long and strewn with witticisms, but this stuff struck me less as &#8220;Man this is so implausible :(&#8221; and more as &#8220;This is so much fun to read, why am I suddenly laughing <i>and</i>&nbsp;crying :):&#8221;<br /><br />Another (weird, flinchy) plus for me: Hazel has two friends that are guys. And yet.&nbsp;<i>A love triangle does not happen.</i><br /><br />What else can I say about it? Things happened. Characters did stuff. Most importantly, everything that happened had weight. Go read it already!</div>

Said building brims with epidemic-stricken people-turned-zombie-things and a variety of scenarios that invite you to question whether any of this is Actually Happening.<br /><br />Because I&#8217;m a &#8220;min-max&#8221; type of player, games like this can do a number on me; I hate wasting in-game time/flares/bullets/food rushing down zombie-filled corridors that yield only dead ends, and upon finding myself in this situation I usually beat a hasty ESC and restart the game. Survival horror&#8217;s tendency to translate its protagonist&#8217;s physical/mental health as a reddening vignette or extra panting animations bewilders me. <i>I want to be 100% all the time, damn it! Tell me exactly when I need 10 more points of food to be fully sane!</i><br /><br />The map is difficult to parse at first, but it expresses my favorite little detail; in darkness it remains in shadow, so that to read it easily you have to be under actual sources of light. (Whoa! So realistic!)</div>

Now that it&#8217;s summer and I&#8217;ve come to rely more on my Orca Card instead of my beloved (yet inactive) student bus pass, a couple things become apparent:<br /><br /><ol><li><b>I really wish I knew when my transfers ended. </b>I don&#8217;t even remember how long transfers are supposed to last. Two hours? Three? When you pay in cash, the bus driver hands you a little piece of paper which can be used as fare for your next bus ride, as long as you&#8217;re fairly within time limits. With Orca, your transfer is invisible, and strict &#8211; are you leaving the bus two minutes after your fare is up, because of traffic or because the bus itself is late? Too bad, you&#8217;re paying the fare again. (This also gets frustrating when you board a bus that&#8217;s &#8220;Pay as you leave&#8221; &#8211; because even if you got on the bus within the time limit, what if you disembark too late?)</li><li><b>I really wish I knew how much money I had on my card as soon as I looked at it. </b>In my mind I imagine a little E-ink box that would happily display your available funds, in a futuristic, perfect society. To be fair, the card reader does tell you what your card&#8217;s remaining balance is once you swipe, but I find myself squinting at the small, gray-on-gray display every time I pass by. And, it would also be nice if this card reader could tell you things like, &#8220;Hey, your transfer will be up at 4:15pm!&#8221;</li></ol><div><br /></div><div>Not knowing when your transfers end can also be problematic for low-income users; as a professor in the HCDE department at UW <a href="http://bethkolko.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/how-technology-encodes-values/">points out</a>&nbsp;from a student dissertation, &#8220;Basically, you board the bus and swipe your card. If you’re inside the allotted transit time, nothing is deducted from your card. If not, the full fare comes off your card. And for some people, that might have been their way to work tomorrow. And that’s it for their cash this week.&#8221;</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I spent the week of the Fourth of July visiting Hawai&#8217;i for the first time. We went to the third-largest island, O&#8217;ahu, a.k.a &#8220;The Gathering Place,&#8221; which is the island which has Hawai&#8217;i&#8217;s capital, Honolulu. Our driver from the airport described&nbsp;Honolulu&nbsp;(&#8220;place of shelter&#8221;) as being named for the fact that the surrounding mountains shield it from bad weather.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AYSJHDHXVR8/UBGx4mqJN9I/AAAAAAAAByk/Rgur-z3m9Qk/s1600/Oahu_(1).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AYSJHDHXVR8/UBGx4mqJN9I/AAAAAAAAByk/Rgur-z3m9Qk/s1600/Oahu_(1).jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">o&#8217;ahu (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oahu">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><a href="http://www.speedishuttle.com/pickup">SpeediShuttle</a>, which has a partnership with the airport, did a great job of taking us to the Seaside Hotel with a minimum of stress despite parades clotting up downtown Honolulu. We ended up paying around $50 for a round-trip, with the promise that we could call their 24-hour hotline at any time and get picked up and taken back to the airport when we needed to catch our departing flight. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend paying in advance for the returning trip to the airport, because no one came to our 5am pickup or picked up the phone, and an hour and a half before our departure time we resorted to taking a cab back to HNL, which cost an extra $40. :( <b>Edit</b>: <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/speedishuttle-update.html">A SpeediShuttle update</a>.<br /><br />We stayed at the Seaside Hotel, which is one of the more modest places in Waikiki, but still well within reach of buslines and tourist fervor. Some online reviews indicated that it used to be &#8220;private&#8221; and reserved for airline employees. You can rent beach towels for the day, swim on a small rooftop pool, and lie on the bed wondering in vain why Discovery Channel broadcasts so many &#8220;[Storage/Property/X] Wars&#8221; shows nowadays. There was free Wi-Fi but we were never able to really connect to it successfully, and relied on the lobby computers for bus schedules instead. (To be honest, it was nice to be on a forced Internet break.)<br /><br />Something that our SpeediShuttle driver recommended we check out was a magazine called <i>101 Things to Do: Oahu, </i>which turned out to be a pretty good guide-slash-advertising booklet. This and other magazines can be picked up for free on most street corners, and contain coupons!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pCDMlZcsGHM/UBGy9wyDYUI/AAAAAAAABys/JP1iu7KtW_s/s1600/mag_oahu.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pCDMlZcsGHM/UBGy9wyDYUI/AAAAAAAABys/JP1iu7KtW_s/s1600/mag_oahu.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">101 Things to Do: Oahu (<a href="http://www.101thingstodo.com/oahu/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><b>Monday</b><br />The first thing we did was go to Hanauma (&#8220;ha-now-ma&#8221;) Bay&nbsp;Nature Preserve, which is essentially a really gorgeous bay historically used by Hawaiian royalty as their private fishing grounds.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nLxdMRmD1Go/UBK3NeXNEKI/AAAAAAAAB1Q/B5OjmJaBfCA/s1600/hanauma.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="194" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nLxdMRmD1Go/UBK3NeXNEKI/AAAAAAAAB1Q/B5OjmJaBfCA/s640/hanauma.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">iphone photos stitched together with <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">hugin</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Admission fee is $7.50. The coolest thing to do here is snorkel; the water is warm and colorful fish dart around pecking at the rocks. (Apparently turtles, sharks, and jellyfish sometimes drift through as well; and we definitely saw at least one pufferfish that had us flailing back to the shore in noob-like panic, haha.) You can rent snorkeling sets (goggles, snorkel breather thing, enormous awkward fins) for $15, or $18 if you want prescription goggles (which were worth it).<br /><br />Other wildlife to be spotted include Indian Mongooses, one of which I spotted sneaking around beach towels placed too close by shady foliage. Mongooses are invasive, and were <a href="http://www.instanthawaii.com/cgi-bin/hawaii?Animals.mongoose">introduced in the 1700s</a> to the islands to deal with rats eating up the sugarcane. (In the end, diurnal mongooses ended up snacking not on noctural rats, but on the eggs of endemic bird species. Whoops.)<br /><br />Hanauma is open all days except its Tuesday sabbath, and is accessible via the 22, which takes 40 minutes to an hour to get there from Waikiki. Because of the crowds, it&#8217;s best to get there early and leave early, since afternoon buses come every half-hour and sometimes can&#8217;t pick everyone up. (The 22 fills up with visitors from the Sea Life Park before accepting people from Hanauma.)<br /><br />The restaurants we visited that day were <a href="http://www.luluswaikiki.com/">Lulu</a>&#8217;s for breakfast, and Marukame Udon for lunch. Lulu&#8217;s had great loco moco and macadamia coconut waffles (though the latter were quite syrup-drenched and sweet). Marukame ended up being our favorite restaurant the whole trip: the udon is freshly-made, cheap (at about $6 a bowl in <i>Waikiki, </i>where prices are tourist-high), and delicious. The tempura isn&#8217;t bad either. :9<br /><br />The best times to go to Marukame are around 3 to 4; after that, it&#8217;s dinner rush.<br /><br />Another place we visited throughout our trip was Tropical Dream Ice Cream, a hole-in-the-wall ice cream place right next to the Seaside Hotel. It served delicious ice cream with local ingredients, including but not limited to: mango, pineapple coconut sorbet, macadamia nut&#8230;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mUPlgihczuQ/UBG77mScgjI/AAAAAAAABzg/YXF5ojUSGdU/s1600/DSC_0387.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mUPlgihczuQ/UBG77mScgjI/AAAAAAAABzg/YXF5ojUSGdU/s320/DSC_0387.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">macadamia nut tastes great with john steinbeck</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><b>Tuesday</b><br />We spent this day walking through downtown Honolulu to try loco moco at L&amp;L&#8217;s, which is kind of like a Hawaiian McDonalds, except all the food comes on white styrofoam trays. (It was pretty good, though almost overly-filling. Then again, maybe we hadn&#8217;t recovered from Marukame the previous day.)<br /><br />The main goal for the day was to visit the <a href="http://www1.honolulu.gov/parks/hbg/fbg.htm">Foster Botanical Garden</a>, one of the many botanical gardens on O&#8217;ahu. The guides at front said it would take about an hour to get through. We went a little fast, but still enjoyed the enormous &#8220;exceptional&#8221; trees, which included this absolutely enormous palm tree:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ihpeylCI02o/UBG83kyBa6I/AAAAAAAABzo/ezRnj-zgRCo/s1600/DSC_0188.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ihpeylCI02o/UBG83kyBa6I/AAAAAAAABzo/ezRnj-zgRCo/s400/DSC_0188.jpg" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">you are so big!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Another cool tree is thorny, percussive&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couroupita_guianensis">cannonball tree</a>&nbsp;(not pictured), and the striped rainbow eucalyptus (below).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LE6alCTs7_Q/UBG9tlOJcfI/AAAAAAAABzw/X9glRa9-t0Y/s1600/DSC_0231.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LE6alCTs7_Q/UBG9tlOJcfI/AAAAAAAABzw/X9glRa9-t0Y/s400/DSC_0231.jpg" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">you are so colorful!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />We also visited the Waikiki Aquarium, which is fairly small but worth a visit if neon-colored fish are your thing. (The giftshop at Hanauma also offers a coupon for $1 off adult admission to the Waikiki Aquarium.) The most impressive part to me was the &#8220;enormous giant huge fish exhibit,&#8221; in which various person-sized fish like the giant trevally circle around.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aW1_5wo7c0I/UBG-eFgoBoI/AAAAAAAABz4/W4CKX6y4lb8/s1600/DSC_0290.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aW1_5wo7c0I/UBG-eFgoBoI/AAAAAAAABz4/W4CKX6y4lb8/s640/DSC_0290.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">you are so, so big</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rZvwdi2nSBI/UBG-tQ7dt9I/AAAAAAAAB0A/3ezRp5M1c8E/s1600/DSC_0246.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rZvwdi2nSBI/UBG-tQ7dt9I/AAAAAAAAB0A/3ezRp5M1c8E/s640/DSC_0246.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">cue the children screaming &#8220;NEMOO&#8221;</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I think we also tried hiking up to Makapu&#8217;u on this day. It&#8217;s reachable by taking the 22 or 23 to Sea Life Park and walking back and up along the highway. The trail is simple &#8211; just an upward curve &#8211; and at the top is a lookout point with a small lighthouse.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VEB4LIe41Lg/UBK6Ah4VbJI/AAAAAAAAB1g/-U3M_YO2_h8/s1600/IMG_0058.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VEB4LIe41Lg/UBK6Ah4VbJI/AAAAAAAAB1g/-U3M_YO2_h8/s320/IMG_0058.jpg" width="239" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the breeze was so strong and nice</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I liked the view back down almost better.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-N4QmospHtA8/UBK6JlJwFJI/AAAAAAAAB1o/EMa10Z6VgxY/s1600/IMG_0062.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-N4QmospHtA8/UBK6JlJwFJI/AAAAAAAAB1o/EMa10Z6VgxY/s400/IMG_0062.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i can&#8217;t remember the name of this mountain, though. diamondhead?</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><b>Wednesday</b><br />On Wednesday we headed out super early to visit Eggs n Things, a restaurant in Waikiki where we had seen a pretty sizable line of people waiting at around 7am. Luckily, time zones made it easy for us to wake up and head out in time to avoid a 20+ minute wait, and the food (loco moco, and banana/macadamia nut french toast) turned out to be just as delicious as hoped. Eggs n Things also has their own triplet of syrups, flavored guava, pineapple, and coconut. They were so delicious I bought the coconut one to take home, only realizing later and with sorrow that one ingredient is <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/05/things-i-learned-from-extra-virginity.html">partially hydrogenated oil</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zwlxi_8jR5Y/UBK4Whmy1kI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/WcCeoqfRr-E/s1600/eggsnthings.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zwlxi_8jR5Y/UBK4Whmy1kI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/WcCeoqfRr-E/s320/eggsnthings.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">loco moco &amp; fancy french toast at eggs n things</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It was the first Wednesday of the month, so we were intending to visit the <a href="http://honolulumuseum.org/">Honolulu Museum of Art</a>&nbsp;on their free day, but because it was also a holiday (July 4th), the museum was closed. We headed up to the <a href="http://www.bishopmuseum.org/">Bishop Museum</a> instead, which was great and had a variety of Hawaii-specific exhibits.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-11WaQ3u2RzA/UBK7EAn6k8I/AAAAAAAAB1w/6maYYjCEQxk/s1600/IMG_0064.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-11WaQ3u2RzA/UBK7EAn6k8I/AAAAAAAAB1w/6maYYjCEQxk/s320/IMG_0064.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">bishop museum courtyard</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A science building describes Hawaii&#8217;s biological diversity and formation with wax volcano simulations, and other buildings contain many cultural and historical artifacts from the Asian immigrants who worked on the sugarcane plantations. We were also able to catch a show in the observatory that showed us where and how to spot Mercury and Venus in the night sky.<br /><br /><br /><b>Thursday</b><br />Thursday was our dedicated &#8220;North Shore&#8221; day. We caught early buses to Waimea Valley Adventure Park. It took two hours to get there, but the drive was quite scenic.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XwtNTeR3EZ0/UBHCZMLq1JI/AAAAAAAAB0k/9W3uds8VbCM/s1600/DSC_0328.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XwtNTeR3EZ0/UBHCZMLq1JI/AAAAAAAAB0k/9W3uds8VbCM/s640/DSC_0328.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a beach near/in waimea valley</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Waimea stands for &#8220;red water,&#8221; and I think refers to how the dirt is reddish with oxidation? (Citation needed.) Waimea Valley Adventure Park itself is a huge botanical garden which leads up to a freshwater waterfall where visitors can swim if rainfall hasn&#8217;t made the area mudslide-hazardous.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Onw1lKavCIk/UBHDBT_1nAI/AAAAAAAAB0s/LQli7K3Ckg0/s1600/DSC_0352.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Onw1lKavCIk/UBHDBT_1nAI/AAAAAAAAB0s/LQli7K3Ckg0/s640/DSC_0352.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">waimea falls</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The falls are cold and 30 feet deep in areas, and floats are provided for people who aren&#8217;t strong swimmers.<br /><br /><br /><b>Friday</b><br />Our last day in Hawaii was spent visiting Kailua. Kailua has the whitest, finest sand on O&#8217;ahu, but is also littered with little pinecones and needles. The day we went, strong wind turned the sand on the shore into fine little bullets, though underneath the waves it was velvet-soft. You can kayak here to a nearby rocky-looking island, but seeing as I can&#8217;t get 20 feet from the shore without fearing I&#8217;ll be swept into the Pacific Ocean, I was content watching people flail their oars around against the waves.<br /><br />Restaurant recommendation: Boots n Kimos, cash-only, which has very yummy pancakes drenched in macadamia nut cream.<br /><br /><br /><b>In Conclusion</b><br />O&#8217;ahu! It was great.</div>

Fun fact: Sequim is the only city in Western Washington that has an irrigation system. (At least, that&#8217;s what the volunteer on our bus to Purple Haze Farms said.

You can tour farms and a broad and variety-filled street fair. The population of European-descended Americans is such that a lot of stuff plays on fairy myths (bottles of &#8220;fairy dust,&#8221; beaded &#8220;fairy bells,&#8221; hose-and-wire &#8220;fairy wings&#8221;), which I rarely see at other street fairs I attend in Seattle.&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender">Fun fact</a>: lavender is part of the mint family, has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, and the price of a pound of it in Roman times was equivalent the price of fifty haircuts.</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">When I approached this next plant at Purple Haze, someone declared, &#8220;Teazle has been around since the time of the woolly mammoth!&#8221;&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipsacus">Wikipedia</a>&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t back this up, but does describe teazle as invasive in the United States and partially&nbsp;carnivorous.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nX85wss1rQw/UBGIB7Fug_I/AAAAAAAABw0/Baxxml7Q1M8/s1600/DSC_0400s.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nX85wss1rQw/UBGIB7Fug_I/AAAAAAAABw0/Baxxml7Q1M8/s640/DSC_0400s.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">teazle/teasel/teazel, aka dipsacus</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">My proudest purchase was half a dozen sedums/phocuses/succulents/stonecrops/hens-n-chicks of various colors, whose specific species I can&#8217;t recall or discover. (Maybe one&#8217;s a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sedumphotos.net/v/sedum-a/Sedum+album+rhodopaeum.jpg.html">Sedum album rhodopaeum</a>?) Fun fact: plants like this must remain outdoors, because their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma">stoma</a>, which is used in photosynthesis and respiration, use a drop in temperature as a signal to open up. So, sedums in an indoor environment with relatively stable temperature suffocate.)</div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L4fMrvyYzdM/UBGIEe_lKtI/AAAAAAAABxM/Op-YKXLclq0/s1600/DSC_0484s.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L4fMrvyYzdM/UBGIEe_lKtI/AAAAAAAABxM/Op-YKXLclq0/s400/DSC_0484s.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i can breathe!</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">My collection of relatively hard-to-kill plants (started with a pair of air plants I got at another street fair) is growing!

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JQd6Q9TXR70/UA1-MoE_1MI/AAAAAAAABvU/_vonhJbyc5s/s1600/thumbnail.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JQd6Q9TXR70/UA1-MoE_1MI/AAAAAAAABvU/_vonhJbyc5s/s320/thumbnail.png" width="233" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">&#8220;before and after&#8221; comparisons for racermate wireframes</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A couple days ago I made up wireframes for a theoretical redesign of the <a href="http://www.racermateinc.com/">Racermate</a>&nbsp;website, where a couple friends of mine work.<br /><br /><br /><h2> Front Page</h2>First was the front page, which I found personally bewildering: the buttons that frame either side of the wall of &#8220;newsletter&#8221; text at the center of the page don&#8217;t have much context, or direction.&nbsp;&#8220;MultiRider Software,&#8221; &#8220;MultiRider Center Locations&#8221; &#8211; what is that, what do I do with it, why is it relevant? &#8220;Wingate Testing with Velotron&#8221; &#8211; what does this indicate or mean to a new user? &#8220;ErgVideo.com&#8221; seems to open a new website completely, how is it affiliated to Racermate, what does it do?<br /><br />For the redesign, I focused on making the site informative to new users.&nbsp;I kept much of the information in the header &#8220;The WORLD LEADER in ELECTRONIC BICYCLE ERGOMETERS&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;OFFICIAL BIKE TRAINERS OF&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; because they&#8217;re good explanations of &#8220;This is who we are, this is why we are trustworthy.&#8221;<br /><br />I made the top navigation buttons larger than in the original design, and made them more self-explanatory: &#8220;COACHES&#8221; in the original turned into &#8220;Find a coach;&#8221; &#8220;MultiRider&#8221; became &#8220;MultiRider: Ride Together&#8221; to give the user more grounding on what they would learn about when clicking through. This would also expand users&#8217; knowledge of Racermate products right on the front page; MultiRider can be immediately understood as a social application of a RacerMate product.<br /><br />The next two &#8220;rows&#8221; of information also serve to focus and explain Racermate through images, rather than text. The first row is a carousel of images, text description, and links to different Racermate products; the next, a much more involved &#8220;This is who we are&#8221; statement.<br /><br />Because word of mouth is important to this product, part of the front page is also devoted to testimonials sent in by happy consumers.<br /><br /><br /><h2> Product Display Page</h2>Talking with friends at Racermate, I learned that online orders make up a little more than half of the total number of orders that this company gets. But when I went through the website myself, I found the <a href="http://www.computrainer.com/rm_inc/sales/pricing_ordering.html">order page</a> bewildering and cluttered with a variety of colors of clots of text. As a new user unfamiliar with the product, I didn&#8217;t understand what exactly the product would be when I ordered it, or what would come with it, or what exactly it is meant to do. To get a full picture of what some products do requires that the user navigate to half a dozen completely different pages. Ordering information is also separated from a product overview, and ordering online requires that the user:<br /><br /><ol><li>Learn about the product by navigating around &#8220;Products&#8221; and all related pages in the top navigation</li><li>Click &#8220;Sales&#8221; in the top navigation</li><li>Hover over desired product</li><li>Click &#8220;Pricing &amp; Information&#8221;</li><li>Parse a long order page</li><li>Click &#8220;Add to Cart&#8221;</li><li>Complete order</li></ol><br />For the redesign, I made the product name and brief description most prominent, and after that, an easy way to switch between views of different product models. Another prominent part of the product display page are images of the product. Features can be described in the text to the right of the product images, or reviewed with more detail further down the page. In the redesign, the steps for ordering online now are:<br /><br /><ol><li>Click &#8220;Products&#8221; in the top navigation, or hover over &#8220;Products&#8221; and select desired product</li><li>Learn about product and its models on a single page</li><li>Click &#8220;Add to Cart&#8221;</li><li>Complete order</li></ol><div><br /></div><br /><h2> What&#8217;s next?</h2><br />A low-fidelity prototype would ensure that the navigation of the website actually makes sense; users would have to be able to know how to complete certain tasks, such as <i>Find out what exactly you get when you order a CompuTrainer</i>, and with real copy provided, we could ensure that the right kind of information is shown on the right pages. (For example, do people want to know more about certain complex features? Less?) User testing would also target current users who use the website as a hub for Racermate-related news, and ensure that they aren&#8217;t alienated.</div>

It occurs to me that I never did update after <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/04/okami-cosplay.html">my previous post on our Okami cosplay</a>. Since then there have been some lovely photos by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pan.jialing">Jia-Ling Pan</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9rEM7yYrrmc/UA2nemqWAsI/AAAAAAAABv4/GjiMb8BJ85I/s1600/150734_10150633782906971_1318607405_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="460" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9rEM7yYrrmc/UA2nemqWAsI/AAAAAAAABv4/GjiMb8BJ85I/s640/150734_10150633782906971_1318607405_n.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">okami celestial brush gods: group photo!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />By the time our tired merch staff had the time to finally be together, we were exhausted and it was past sunset, so we posed underneath some of the convention center lighting.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4TAWqMnxqg8/UA2py41ywAI/AAAAAAAABwQ/M-_1m4EfTaY/s1600/552811_3751206788206_96666576_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="238" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4TAWqMnxqg8/UA2py41ywAI/AAAAAAAABwQ/M-_1m4EfTaY/s320/552811_3751206788206_96666576_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">werq that lighting</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I really appreciated Jia-Ling taking our photos&#8230;not only was she dedicated to making sure the lighting worked, but she also tried to get at the heart of our characters&#8217; personalities and making sure they showed through.
