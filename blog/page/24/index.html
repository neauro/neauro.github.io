It swerves dangerously close to racist statements sometimes (&#8220;the French language&#8230;romantic and <em>spirituel</em> but also, of course, the paragon of logic and clarity;&#8221; sure, but have you really studied other languages, or is this whole book going to be European-centric?), but the tone is pretty subjective and the discussion (at least for now) goes deeper than pure labeling.  <span class="shh">And at some point he mentioned Tagalog, which made me really happy :D :D It&#8217;s always a shock when I learn non-Filipino know Tagalog people &#8211; even now, it&#8217;s like, <em>Why?</em> Derek once explained to me that he thinks Japanese people feel the same way, which is why they were always so shocked when we showed up all Nihongo.  <em>Why would you bother learning Japanese?!</em></span><br /><br />Anyway, the most interesting part thus far talks about this guy named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>, who was eloquent but not considered completely sane by his contemporaries due to his fervored attempts to connect the Greek pantheon to Christian religious figures.  In reading Homer&#8217;s works, he realized that Homer has a strange treatment of color: he hardly uses it.  Example: for almost anyone, the sea is blue.  But to Homer it is &#8220;wine-looking&#8221; &#8211; just as oxen are.  And just as iron is.  But his treatment of color is also inconsistent:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;Iron&#8230;is said to be &#8216;violet&#8217; in one passage, &#8216;gray&#8217; elsewhere, and in yet another place it is referred to as <em>aithon</em>, a term otherwise used to refer to the color of horses, lions, and oxen.&#8221;</blockquote><br />It turns out the key is in the fact that Homer references &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;white&#8221; 270 times, whereas the references to other colors put together is hardly anything.<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;He may often talk about light and brightness, but seldom does he venture beyond gray scale into the splendor of prism.  In those instances when colors are mentioned, they are often vague and highly inconsistent: his sea is wine-colored, and when not wine-colored, it is violet, just like his sheep.  His honey is green and his southern sky is anything but blue&#8230;.&#8221;</blockquote><br />And that&#8217;s the key, I guess: Homer saw the world not so much in colors as they did in lightnesses and darknesses.  The rest of the Greeks did as well, since &#8220;violet-colored hair&#8221; is seen in other Greek poetry in ancient times.<br /><br />As it turns out, the world for green, <em>chloros</em>, has an etymology which links it to &#8220;young herbage,&#8221; a fresh light green; and if you think of <em>chloros</em> as meaning more &#8220;light&#8221; than &#8220;green,&#8221; then &#8220;green honey&#8221; is really just &#8220;pale, bright honey.&#8221;  By extension, faces &#8220;green with disgust&#8221; may actually be &#8220;pale with disgust.&#8221;<br /><br />AND THAT&#8217;S WHY I WROTE THIS POST.  BECAUSE I REALIZED THAT OUR COMMONLY USED TERM, &#8220;[WHATEVER]&#8217;S FACE TURNED GREEN,&#8221; DOES NOT ACTUALLY MEAN THAT IT TURNED GREEN, BUT HAS A CONNECTION TO THE ANCIENT LACK OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE COLOR GREEN AND PALENESS <span class="shh">(maybe)</span>.<br /><br />As for &#8220;the ancient lack of blue&#8221; &#8211; I guess Goldstone&#8217;s theory is that humanity only grew to have a vivid appreciation of color when color started to matter, i.e. when artificial dyes started to become easy to come by.  Ancient Greek (and ancient Indian languages, despite their praising of T3h Heavens) lack a word for &#8220;blue.&#8221;<br /><br />And I guess perceptions of color are even changing <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/4013694698/datchan-on-the-issues-the-changing-standards-of">in more recent times</a>.<br /><br />Anyway, faces green/pale with disgust.  That&#8217;s all.</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KcWBOVnS9w0/TauiwPgs-KI/AAAAAAAAALs/IaAgb42rZqc/s1600/unityterrain.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KcWBOVnS9w0/TauiwPgs-KI/AAAAAAAAALs/IaAgb42rZqc/s640/unityterrain.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />There&#8217;s something really fun about making maps or 3d terrain.  I feel like I can see new stories rising at every line and edge.<br /><br />For our introductory game using the <a href="http://heartrategames.com/">HeartRate Games</a> API that I helped to create, we&#8217;re building a really simple game involving bunnies and monsters (both arbitrarily chosen during brainstorming), where bunnies are things to be chased and monsters are things to be crushed at high velocity.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4WL8NEf6E0E/TaulAVabpXI/AAAAAAAAAL8/kSWXBjWDzw4/s1600/DSC_0375.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4WL8NEf6E0E/TaulAVabpXI/AAAAAAAAAL8/kSWXBjWDzw4/s640/DSC_0375.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><br />To learn Unity in the first place, Mari and I read through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unity-Game-Development-Essentials-Goldstone/dp/184719818X">Unity Game Development Essentials</a>, which was a pretty good primer, though it&#8217;s hard for me to remember some of the tutorials now that I&#8217;m trying to work through things on my own.  I think that&#8217;s more a fault of the fact that I&#8217;ve never done game development, really, much less much manipulation of 3d objects.  In our Computer Graphics class it was all C++, compile, see if your shadows rendered properly, change stuff, compile again.<br /><br />Anyway, the basics I know of Unity should be enough to implement a basic skeleton of a game, more as a proof of concept than anything polished and pretty.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aZRyFlgj0ek/TaukuK2N3mI/AAAAAAAAAL0/wYT4Lr-cZjI/s1600/DSC_0377.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aZRyFlgj0ek/TaukuK2N3mI/AAAAAAAAAL0/wYT4Lr-cZjI/s640/DSC_0377.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dat skeleton</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It&#8217;s a shame that we won&#8217;t be able to do something uber-fancy, but there&#8217;s definitely not enough time in eight weeks, amidst my other classes, to do anything else. D: In particular we were brainstorming various challenges to an exercise game, and came up with some &#8211;<br /><br /><ul><li>How do you make an exercise game engaging all the way through, so people don&#8217;t get bored in the middle?</li><li>How can you make sure people can rest when they&#8217;re tired and not get too penalized?</li><li>How can you even force people to rest during long stretches of exercise?</li><li>When people go up to a stationary bike at the gym, they may just be concerned with exercising for a period of time; so how do you time a game and make sure that people can finish a round in 20 minutes or 30 minutes, and feel satisfied?</li></ul><br />Thus, bunnies and monsters. &nbsp;Our bunnies are the main incentive &#8211; they speed up when players need to speed up &#8211; and monsters to be defeated can have constraints on their vanquishing, which in turn puts constrains on a user&#8217;s action. &nbsp;One monster could require speeding up very fast momentarily to flatten it; another maybe could be unbeatable, and thus can only be dealt with by sneaking past it, slowly, or at a constant heart rate.<br /><br />We were also exploring different ways that we could use a game to guide people through proper warming up, then exercise, then cooling down, through different stages of a level.  What I mostly want to do is make it so that an exercise game is capable of educating people about exercise, which is something I feel I never really received properly; for example, you&#8217;re told in your P.E. class that it&#8217;s good to warm up and cool down, but why, exactly?  What&#8217;s the difference between diastolic and systolic blood pressure?  What&#8217;s their proper ranges, and what does it mean if their numbers are too high or too low?<br /><br />Nowadays you could just Google this information, but learning it in the context of exercising would be more fun, I think.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So a couple of days ago I attended <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/technologybrierdudleysblog/2014767469_zynga_launches_seattleville_be.html">the launch of Zynga&#8217;s Seattle office</a>.  It was pretty delicious; I guess Zynga has their own pomegranate martini with Pop Rocks in it.  They sank to the bottom though and become saturated with t3h alcohols pretty quickly.  My other favorite food was this sort of fried wonton with the most melty sashimi in it, which came with a sort of guacamole-with-edamame substance.  Also present: hand-made marshmallows dipped in chocolate and covered in nuts and thinly sliced almonds.<br /><br />I went with David and Fransiskus and we all managed to get pictures with Mark Pincus XD<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X94S1A0OyYk/TaoFcg39kjI/AAAAAAAAALM/2cX_OsjL8G4/s1600/photo.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X94S1A0OyYk/TaoFcg39kjI/AAAAAAAAALM/2cX_OsjL8G4/s320/photo.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">and then he went off to mingle elsewhere</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then we chatted with some of the other engineers at the event, who all seemed to be peripheral to games in some way &#8211; I even saw the guy who gave the original concept for <a href="http://heartrategames.com/">one of my research projects</a>.  Mostly I was pretty hyped to get Zynga-world money, which we did end up getting at the very end in a gift bag, along with a nifty thermos.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NzqAbYNCcdM/TaoHnkqJOxI/AAAAAAAAALU/F2A-SnJaRrA/s1600/DSC_0390.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NzqAbYNCcdM/TaoHnkqJOxI/AAAAAAAAALU/F2A-SnJaRrA/s320/DSC_0390.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">swag, yeeee</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then, because David and Fransiskus like it so much, I started playing CityVille.  Which has actually turned out to be really fun o___o I&#8217;ve already been playing <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/02/okay-dude-so-planting-nachos-is.html">FarmVille</a> for a while, and I started FrontierVille because of hearing the Civilization designer created it, but CityVille strikes a perfect balance in between them.  I like the clean artwork and the little people that wave at you and the general friendliness of the whole thing.  The sound effects for when you pick up different resources are also really happy-inducing somehow.  For seriose.  They&#8217;re on par with Zelda SFX for uncovering mystery doors and opening treasure chests.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n_pMrKX-Dxk/TaoIAi5v67I/AAAAAAAAALc/yb0iVhSjdU8/s1600/cityville.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="249" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n_pMrKX-Dxk/TaoIAi5v67I/AAAAAAAAALc/yb0iVhSjdU8/s320/cityville.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so many things to click and feel productive with &lt;3</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Though, I guess a Zynga game is also much more fun definitively if you have a ton of people to play it with, unlike in FrontierVille, where I desperately keep posting requests for Juicy Berries and Critter Milk and have been getting no response.  There have been shy and sick baby creatures on my homestead for months.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-owd_CkgAro4/TaoJ4CfgVII/AAAAAAAAALk/sx-86Dv4v3M/s1600/frontierville.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="257" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-owd_CkgAro4/TaoJ4CfgVII/AAAAAAAAALk/sx-86Dv4v3M/s320/frontierville.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">none of you are ever getting help. &nbsp;ever</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I definitely want to incorporate the &#8220;popping out of things&#8221; like coins and XP in Get Across too, maybe so that when you move onto a tile or something you get rewarded with little coins and bits.  I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s too much of a &#8220;casual&#8221; mechanic that will end up turning people off, though&#8230;I guess for now we&#8217;ll put it off into an advanced feature.</div>

I looked for Youtube videos and then just decided to download an emulator.  It&#8217;s quite fun. :D<br /><br /><span class="shh">It&#8217;s amazing how much you can feel for the fate of a couple pixels.</span></div>

So <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/operating%20systems">OS</a> ended, and the world didn&#8217;t, and I&#8217;m taking the games capstone this quarter.  I&#8217;ve wanted to take this class for forever, and finally&#8230;!<br /><br />But all the initial excitement was broken by the professor&#8217;s declaration on the very first day.  &#8220;The requirement this quarter is that you all have to make social games.&#8221;<br /><br />A sudden discomfort in the room.  Social games?  <em>Really?</em><br /><br />We brainstormed hastily, still in shock, and during discussion exchanged mutters.  &#8220;I really wanted to make a <em>real</em> game this quarter.&#8221;<br /><br />Hard to think otherwise then <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/03/the-social-games-rant-you-didnt-hear-from-gdc/">people tend to feel so visceral about social games.</a> <span class="shh">(That link is there more for the comments than the actual article.)</span>  Around the time the Zynga/Hidden Agenda competition started, I started playing FarmVille for t3h research, and I&#8217;ve continued playing it, alongside FrontierVille, though I like the original FV much better &#8211; it lags on my computer less, and I have more Friends who play it, which makes it slightly easier to obtain gifts and stuff.  Plus I guess I&#8217;m more into the whole pastoral ideal thing than <strike>manifest destiny</strike> the wild wild west.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been trying desperately to work out why people hate social games so much and made the mistake of asking my Facebook network about it.  Given the fact that the intersection of Friends who are a) on the Internets and b) video game savvy are also c) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I7xHg7kmr0">intense about Smash</a>, I generally received snark and pointers to <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33059/Braids_Blow_Social_Games_Are_Not_Very_Social.php">interviews with Jonathan Blow</a>.<br /><br />But, anyway.  I guess the point is that I&#8217;ve been going over it back and forth without much conclusion.   To me, boiled down to their barest bones, FarmVille and WoW (more accepted in that group) are not so much different.  The mechanics encourage you to stick around in exchange for endorphins and the illusion (?) of productivity.  Click something, get something.  Millions of people just float happily in this broth every day.  Why get angry about it?<br /><br />That being said, I was (not completely) swayed to drop the class at the mention of ~*Social Games*~ like a couple other people were, though it would be a lie to say that I wasn&#8217;t disappointed at all.  It&#8217;s hard to think of new social games when things like Zynga and Bejeweled Blitz occupy so much of social game mindshare.  But I wracked my brain and when Andreas started talking about a cardgame called Heartbreak (the rules of which I cannot find online right now, as he described them to me) I decided to apply this to a board game and BAM.  GAME IDEA.<br /><br />PRESENTED IMPROMPTU IN FRONT OF THE CLASS THE NEXT DAY.<br /><br />EARNING NO INTERESTED CLASSMATES INITIALLY.<br /><br />THEN, TWO!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fs5lsvP0CnE/TZ6x_hiv1SI/AAAAAAAAAK8/IWF2FBnShA0/s1600/getacross.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="241" width="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fs5lsvP0CnE/TZ6x_hiv1SI/AAAAAAAAAK8/IWF2FBnShA0/s320/getacross.jpg" /></a></div><br />We&#8217;ve worked it out a little more and did the presentation pitch and I think we&#8217;re actually off to a good start.  My half-hearted, half-hated social game idea is now something that I&#8217;m pretty excited about!  It&#8217;s called <strong>Get Across</strong>.  The objective of the game is to get across a board, or &#8220;terrain,&#8221; comprising obstacles such as mountains, monsters, bodies of water.  You can specialize in three classes, and &#8220;leveling up&#8221; grants you more ability cards.  It&#8217;s essentially a collaborative online board game.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t want to get my hopes too high, but it will be a success if I can have my Smash- and HoN-playing friends to play this game and enjoy it, play it and have that sort of heart-racing, &#8220;We&#8217;re working together and beating everything!&#8221; feeling at least once. :x</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I went to Portland last weekend with Andreas and we visited the <a href="http://japanesegarden.com/">Japanese garden</a>. (I&#8217;m still shocked that out of all the Japanese gardens in the world, even the ones in Japan, it&#8217;s the one in <em>Portland</em> that is japanesegarden.com.)<br /><br />It was quite beautiful.  I had the impression when I entered that it was much larger than Seattle&#8217;s Japanese garden, but now I&#8217;m not quite sure.  Seattle has a wide impressive lake while Portland has waterfalls, and since it&#8217;s set up at a fairly high altitude, rather than set between the roads crossing through the Arboretum, Portland reminded me more of the gardens that I visited with Derek in Kyoto, especially seeing the high, green, looming cliffs.  Also, just like at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiyomizudera">Kiyomizudera</a>, there&#8217;s a good view of Portland sprawling out.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/4991486476/in/set-72157624660642459/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LQ5jvg-t7Po/TYv2ZG6FhRI/AAAAAAAAAJs/QKcdwpl-SmU/s320/4991486476_7b85d75ba5_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is the view from Kiyomizudera; I don&#8217;t have one from Portland since for some reason for this whole trip I wasn&#8217;t inspired to take many pictures :/</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was talking with Heatherchan later, who mentioned that the garden was kind of &#8220;underwhelming,&#8221; and I think when I was there I felt that way too.  <em>We climbed this entire mountain for nothing?</em>  I think on the whole it&#8217;s because Japanese gardens contain a ton of moss.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/5556088909/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-47108ROc8ao/TYv8dUzdfKI/AAAAAAAAAKc/M8qLk2uWelM/s320/5556088909_170fd3e033_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">moss-covered branches</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/5556090059/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Yo2Jlhd0cvc/TYv8drHonUI/AAAAAAAAAKk/Fi80tmuNSPI/s320/5556090059_70224e922f_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">mossy tufts</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/5556706640/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DC2L7qDUj0E/TYv8dyUHY3I/AAAAAAAAAKs/FFfuCHrLbiQ/s320/5556706640_fa52e48c34_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">mossy rocks</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/5556678042/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l0bK0ytcsrE/TYv8d0AJ-5I/AAAAAAAAAK0/8VKBGiE7lYE/s320/5556678042_b68d623a32_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">just, mossy mcmosserson, everywhere</td></tr></tbody></table><br />When people think of gardens, I&#8217;m sure that they think of gardens erupting in splendor, maybe &#8211; as Andreas would put it &#8211; roses and shit everywhere, heavy floral scents, bees.  Grass, at the very least.  In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chado">chado</a> class I took autumn quarter, we spent some time learning about Japanese gardens in relation to tea ceremony and how extraordinary features like beautiful flowers in a path can detract from the solemnity and concentration needed in a ceremony.  Instead of thinking about your guests or your host, about how this moment you&#8217;re spending with them can never be repeated ever again in the history of the universe, you&#8217;re thinking, <em>God, look at these roses and shit.</em><br /><br />I imagine that this attitude influences Japanese gardens a lot; that is, if I&#8217;m underwhelmed by a Japanese garden, it&#8217;s probably doing its duty in giving me an opportunity to meditate on my life and my choices so that they&#8217;ll resonate like stones dropped into a still pool.<br /><br /><span class="shh">etc. etc.</span><br /><br />A lot of Portland Japanese Garden was under construction, too, so I can imagine that if it lacked a little majesty, it will probably acquire it later.<br /><br />There was a stone garden by a Japanese-style house that was under construction, and since we climbed for forever to reach the garden, Andreas and I sat down and I proceeded to take tons of pictures, with the (vague) intent to create a panorama.  Andreas insisted that I stitch it together by hand, but since programs are written to save time and because they want to be used, I just Googled panorama stitching and downloaded the first program I found, called <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a>.<br /><br />It&#8217;s pretty easy to use.  You just dump all your pictures in there, put in your camera data (if it&#8217;s already not interpreted for you), and then say, &#8220;Go, program!  Align!&#8221;<br /><br />Disclaimer: I read no instructions and knew absolutely nothing about this software or panorama-stitching softwares at all, so I was just kind of experimenting and seeing what would happen.  At some point the program said that it couldn&#8217;t find coordinations between two groups of photos, and asked for control points, which I kind of assumed (with my quarter&#8217;s knowledge of computer vision) that it wanted me to tell it what points in two different pictures corresponded to the same object in both.  This was easy and kind of fun to do.<br /><br />This was my first result:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qnc33xmH_eA/TYv4BOKTpBI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/9hnNzARl47s/s1600/portlandjg_pano_orig.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="209" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qnc33xmH_eA/TYv4BOKTpBI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/9hnNzARl47s/s320/portlandjg_pano_orig.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh my goodness why what happened</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was kind of disappointed because I thought that everything would just look perfect off the bat (.___. The weird mossy spot to the right was obviously wrong, and there are rocks off to the right that are weird too.<br /><br />But then I thought, <em>Wait.  What if I add more control points?</em><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AF5eEECpYwg/TYv4iRS2_-I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/0buYTC_U5cg/s1600/portlandjg_pano_v2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="175" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AF5eEECpYwg/TYv4iRS2_-I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/0buYTC_U5cg/s320/portlandjg_pano_v2.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">what! &nbsp;it kind of worked!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It is super fun to add more control points.  I also like how the program shows you the strength of the match in the control points between two different pictures.<br /><br />There was still the obvious mess of the railing below though, probably because it lacks features, to the extent that it&#8217;s kind of difficult for even me to make control points. :/<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2qcePuU2W0s/TYv5IsK4f9I/AAAAAAAAAKE/dUBMC-Dzfu4/s1600/portlandjg_pano_v3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="237" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2qcePuU2W0s/TYv5IsK4f9I/AAAAAAAAAKE/dUBMC-Dzfu4/s320/portlandjg_pano_v3.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">we&#8217;re getting there, though</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And, finally:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n8xPQhr3pGE/TYv53-ygKbI/AAAAAAAAAKM/6PFi9yF-5uE/s1600/portlandjg_pano.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="351" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n8xPQhr3pGE/TYv53-ygKbI/AAAAAAAAAKM/6PFi9yF-5uE/s400/portlandjg_pano.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">still a couple weird spots, but good for a first try when i don&#8217;t really know what i&#8217;m doing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Mental notes for making panoramas in the future:<br /><ul><li>Don&#8217;t give up after the program&#8217;s first attempt at stitching; find places that are weirded out and add more control points around that region.</li><li>If something is fairly long and texturally featureless (i.e. a pole) maybe try placing a hand on it or some other marking, to give the program an easier time at aligning.</li><li>Make sure to get pictures at the border of the wanted panorama!  I ended up with a lot of holes which prevented me from getting a good rectangle 3:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xjqqVBKW1y0/TYv6GMDroOI/AAAAAAAAAKU/SqPSKeiB8WY/s1600/panoooooooorama.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="226" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xjqqVBKW1y0/TYv6GMDroOI/AAAAAAAAAKU/SqPSKeiB8WY/s320/panoooooooorama.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">YOU RUINED EVERYTHING</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li>I should probably also try standing up and walking around next time when taking pictures to avoid the fisheye effect;; Not that it&#8217;s entirely ugly.</li></ul></div>

And I mean, TED talks, amirite?<br /><br />But as the lecture progressed, it started talking more concerning giving feedback based on students&#8217; education and such, all very game-y things which made it more obvious why it was being circulated through that mailing list.<br /><br /><blockquote>But then I started getting letters from teachers. And the teachers would write, saying, &#8220;We use your videos to flip the classroom&#8230;what I do is I assign the lectures for homework. And what used to be homework, I now have the students doing in the classroom.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8230;when those teachers are doing that, there&#8217;s the obvious benefit &#8211; the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did. They can pause, repeat at their own pace, at their own time. But the more interesting thing is &#8211; and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom &#8211; by removing the one size fits all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home, and then when you go to the classroom, letting them do work, having the teacher walk around, having the peers actually be able to interact with each other, <strong>these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom. They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience &#8211; 30 kids with their fingers on their lips, not allowed to interact with each other. A teacher, no matter how good, has to give this one size fits all lecture to 30 students &#8211; blank faces, slightly antagonistic &#8211; and now it&#8217;s a human experience. Now they&#8217;re actually interacting with each other.</strong></blockquote><br />That technology is the humanizing thing, rather than classrooms, definitely is not intuitive at all &#8211; and when I hear something like assigning students videos for homework, the first thing I think is, <em>Are they really going to do this?</em> Are high school and younger students really going to subject themselves to mental stimulation outside of school itself?<br /><br />I guess the main belief is that people really do want to improve themselves, and will do so, given the opportunity; this is a big part of <em><a href="http://realityisbroken.org/">Reality is Broken</a></em> by Jane McGonigal, which I&#8217;m presently reading (and almost done with!).  She writes that one of the things that&#8217;s essential to human happiness is &#8220;the experience, or at least the hope, of being successful.  We want to feel powerful in our own lives and show off to others what we&#8217;re good at.  We want to be optimistic about our own chances for success, to aspire to something, and to feel like we&#8217;re getting better over time.&#8221;<br /><br />Which brings me back to my high school, which always bothered me.  We were reknowned for having tons of AP courses and turning out students that did really well in them; I took AP Computer Science A and AB there (back when AB was still offered) and our teacher told us that the girls in our class were the stark majority of all the girls that took the AP Compsci test.  By graduation, I&#8217;d taken around 12 AP courses, with grades of 3 or above in all the tests. <span class="shh">Damn you, Chemistry!  And Physics B!  Arrrghhh</span><br /><br />One thing that was unique about our school was that if you wanted to take an AP course, you could; there was no minimum GPA requirement, no test that you had to pass.  For some national government bill simulation, our class tried to pass a bill that would allow this sort of &#8220;If you want to take a harder course, do it&#8221; behavior in every high school, but it was voted down by some east coast school that said, essentially, &#8220;If you just allow anyone to take an AP course, then you will ruin the class for everyone else.  The teacher will have to cater to these dumb people, the discussions will have to be held on a lower level, we deny it.&#8221;<br /><br />Which made us all really angry, I guess, and talking about it with my friends later, we pretty much agreed: If you&#8217;re failing behind in class, it&#8217;s not the teacher&#8217;s fault, sorry bro, you&#8217;ve just got to keep up.<br /><br />So if you wanted to take AP Everything in our school, you could &#8211; and I kind of imagine this as also being parallel to having that opportunity to be better, to learn more.  Our AP courses, however, had a reputation for being pretty difficult, which, though it may be true, also contributed to what I think was an unfair gap in our school.  On one side were the AP students; on the other side, your stereotypical high school students who traded drugs during lunch and graduated to work at the mall a couple miles from the school.<br /><br />This itself is an unfair description, but also what happens, not just in one high school, when education is offered and only a subset take advantage of it.  If education is all about success and being better, why do some students not pursue it, despite its realtion to basic human happiness?  What is it about our present education system that is anti-compelling?<br /><br />And we AP kids, who I speak of so highly, what did we really learn &#8211; did we come out of high school with grades that prove usable knowledge, or are our A&#8217;s just badges of facts that we&#8217;ve memorized and will forget the next year?<br /><br /><blockquote>In a traditional classroom, you have a couple of homework, homework, lecture, homework, lecture, and then you have a snapshot exam. And that exam, whether you get a 70 percent, an 80 percent, a 90 percent, or a 95 percent, the class moves on to the next topic. And even that 95 percent student, what was the five percent they didn&#8217;t know? Maybe they didn&#8217;t know what happens when you raise something to the zero power. And then you go build on that in the next concept. <strong>That&#8217;s analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle, and maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time, and I give you that bicycle for two weeks. And then I come back after two weeks, and I say, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s see. You&#8217;re having trouble taking left turns. You can&#8217;t quite stop. You&#8217;re an 80 percent bicyclist.&#8221; So I put a big C stamp on your forehead and then I say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a unicycle.&#8221;</strong><br /><br />But as ridiculous as that sounds, that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s happening in our classrooms right now. And the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing calculus all of a sudden, despite being smart, despite having good teachers. And it&#8217;s usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation. So our model is learn math the way you&#8217;d learn anything, like the way you would learn a bicycle. Stay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle. Do it as long as necessary until you have mastery. The traditional model, it penalizes you for experimentation and failure, but it does not expect mastery. <strong>We encourage you to experiment. We encourage you to failure. But we do expect mastery.</strong></blockquote><br />&#8220;Encouraging failure&#8221; or at least allowing it, accepting it, and using it, rather than punishing it, is also a very <em>game</em> thing.  I&#8217;m reminded of when Andreas told me a story about a teacher of his who was a little eccentric, an intelligent world traveler (or something of the sort) who abruptly settled down to become a teacher and allowed his students to take tests over and over again until they learned the material.  If you have an opportunity to do better, to <em>be</em> visibly better, I don&#8217;t know who would leave it.<br /><br /><span class="shh">I mean, I guess if I had the opportunity to be visibly better at baseball or something it probably wouldn&#8217;t matter to me.  But that&#8217;s because I already have other things that I&#8217;d rather be improving.</span><br /><br />Something else that I really like about this anti-traditional model is the idea of <em>experimenting</em>, which I feel was really lacking in my education up until a very recent point (as in, a couple of months ago, when I realized <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/02/game-bonding-time.html">I could make games</a> if I wanted).  A lot of grade school is all about just learning basics &#8211; which is good, but I wish that it wasn&#8217;t in college that you started questioning <em>why</em> something happens, and start to expand on ideas, and be imaginative.<br /><br />At 11:48 of this video, there&#8217;s a presentation of a &#8220;dashboard&#8221; which basically shows a detailed breakdown of how each student is doing.<br /><br /><blockquote>Green means the student&#8217;s already proficient. Blue means they&#8217;re working on it &#8211; no need to worry. Red means they&#8217;re stuck. And what the teacher does is literally just say, &#8220;Let me intervene on the red kids.&#8221; Or even better, &#8220;Let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their peer.&#8221;</blockquote><br />This whole part reminds me of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=new+york+game+school">the game school</a> in New York, which, despite being incredibly awesome and employing game techniques to improve students&#8217; will to learn, seems incredibly specific.  Though both this dashboard and the game school use visible acquisition of mastery to motivate students, I could see the dashboard being more easily used by schools like my old high school.  Something like this is not just helpful to motivate students, but to allow them to see where they need help &#8211; no small feat, really, because I&#8217;ve always thought that the biggest obstacle to learning something is knowing the right question to ask.<br /><br />I wonder if any teachers actually take talks like this seriously.  Whenever I think of grade school education, it seems incredibly set in its ways.  If it changed, what would happen to all the iconic high school drama and archetypes?  YOU CAN&#8217;T HAVE A &#8220;THE SMART KID&#8221; IF EVERYONE IS SMART, OKAY.</div>

It took a couple months for it to arrive, but once it did, I opened it <em>and didn&#8217;t close it until I was done</em> (pretty much).<br /><br />What the heck?!  Katniss seemed at first to be almost a Bella-type character &#8211; a little snarky, a little spiteful of the people around her, such as her mother &#8211; but unlike empty, hate-for-nothing Bella, she had reasons and whys.  And at first I thought that The Hunger Games would be nothing new &#8211; maybe something like Battle Royale and The Running Man put together &#8211; but somehow &#8211; it was just <em>perfect</em>.  A suspenseful story, full-fleshed characters with a lot to fight for, <br /><br />Luckily the next two books came in more promptly (maybe because everyone always wants to read the first book?) and I finished the second at 4:30am, and the third at the following 2:30am, and then just lied there in bed, exhausted.  It&#8217;s so rare that you just find books <em>this good</em>.  So rare that there&#8217;s a YA book about war that I feel treats it with the gravity and heartbreak that I feel war deserves &#8211; makes you feel the pain of people you love dying, for no reason, just so that one person can be in power and not another.  And the pain that the characters went through felt so <em>powerful</em>&#8230;<br /><br />You really should just read it yourself o___o There&#8217;s only a couple books in this world like these ones.<br /><br />After reading it, I felt more inspired to write the story that I&#8217;ve been working on since forever, to <em>really</em> write it, to make it this good.  But, I feel so in awe.  How could I possibly ever be this good?  How would I be able to put believably put my characters through this much, believably have them get themselves out of it?</div>

And even when I received the confirming e-mail, I honestly didn&#8217;t think that it was that big of a deal.  No one ever talked to me about grad school — not my parents — I didn&#8217;t really get what the difference was between an MS and a PHD until a month ago.  It was only ever seriously mentioned to me by my high school computer science teacher, and even then I don&#8217;t think he meant for me to pursue HCDE/HCI/H-etc., which, despite my great interest in it, still seems to me to be a sort of &#8220;liberal artsy&#8221; type of study, and therefore somehow not as prestigious as something mathy or sciencey.  (No offense to any liberal artsy folk — after all, I am one of you at heart — and surely you must know too, the feeling of somehow being <em>wrong</em> because it seems like <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-11-23/politics/obama.science_1_science-education-math-and-science-president-obama?_s=PM:POLITICS">even the president disapproves of you</a>.)<br /><br />In any case.  I am happy that I&#8217;m working on a degree in computer science, but the fact is that I really feel like I just haven&#8217;t&#8230;felt like I&#8217;ve learned everything that I wanted to.  I feel like I&#8217;ve spent most of my undergrad years half-asleep at the wheel, and now I&#8217;ve only just woken up and realized that I can do <em>other things</em>, I can stretch beyond given assignments, I can apply for jobs and pick myself up if it doesn&#8217;t work out.  And that&#8217;s why I went after the Master&#8217;s, mostly: because I&#8217;ve really liked what little I&#8217;ve learned about design, because I want more reasons to stay in Seattle, because I still want to be a student, because I was cruising Bungie&#8217;s site and it had one position I was interested in, and for this position they were hiring people <em>with advanced education in HCI or related fields</em>.<br /><br />Today I broke the news to Alex and he hugged me super tightly, the same way Mariko and Leilani did, and he congratulated me like Andreas and even his parents did, and I started to feel like, <em>Wait.<br /><br />Is this more important than I think it is?  What have I gotten myself into?</em><br /><br />I am looking forward to it, though.  I hope that when I arrive at that first class, when I get my first homework assignment, that I feel like it&#8217;s a delight to do and not a chore.  What a novel thing, to be so excited about studying.</div>
