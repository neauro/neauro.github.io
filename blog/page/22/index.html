  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
For whatever reason, adding a model to a database in Rails took me forever to understand.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kellydunn">Kelly</a>, I now have model-making in Rails down to an art.<br /><br />Want to add a new table or a new column to your Rails application?  This is what you do!<br /><br /><br /><h3>1. Create a new .rb file for your model</h3>Let&#8217;s say that, just like me, you want to create a new database table in your application to keep track of information about dogs.  We (by virtue of the same logic which affords physics problems friction-less vacuums with which to work in) already have a couple tables in our database: one pertaining to users (breeders or owners of dogs), and one pertaining to breeds.  We will keep it simple for now; all we want to know about a dog object for now is what its name is, what user it belongs to, and what breed it is.<br /><br />To add a Dogs table, we first need to create a file which will describe its model.  Part of this is describing what the relationship of the new model is to existing models, like User and Breed.  From real-world experience, we know that a dog generally has one user/owner, and one breed.<br /><br />So, create a file in <strong>app/models/</strong> called <strong>dog.rb</strong>, and type in the following:<br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class Dog &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />  belongs_to :user<br />  belongs_to :breed<br />end<br /></pre>Dog inherits Active Record.  Active Record&#8217;s sole purpose of existence is to help create associations between different objects.  This code will later be macro&#8217;ed out by Active Record into something more lower-level to create the associations.<br /><br />The lines that start with <code>belongs_to</code> describe the relationship that this new model has to existing ones.  Basically, a dog belongs to one owner/user, and to one breed.  <br /><br />Rails also has another keyword called <code>has_one</code>, which at first might also seem like an okay association to make between dogs and users; after all, a dog <em>has_one</em> user, right?  <a href="http://duanesbrain.blogspot.com/2006/05/ruby-on-rails-hasone-versus-belongsto.html">But belongs_to is more correct, because has_one implies more of a one-to-one relationship</a>, where you might be doing something like creating a new user every time you create a new dog.  Since users may later obtain more dogs, <code>belongs_to</code> would be more appropriate in the case you want to attach a new dog to an existing user.  (Note: belongs_to also makes it so that the Dogs table will have to be responsible for its foreign key with Users, whereas it would be the opposite case for has_one.)<br /><br /><br /><h3>2. Change your existing models to reflect their relationship to the new model</h3>Because a User can have many dogs, and have many different breeds of dogs, User should now look like this: <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;acts_as_authentic<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :dogs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :breeds, :through =&gt; :dogs<br />end<br /></pre>And because many dogs can be of a certain breed, and breeds can be owned by multiple owners, Breeds will look the same &#8211; <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class Breed &lt; ActiveRecord::Base<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :dogs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;has_many :users, :through =&gt; :dogs<br />end<br /></pre><br /><br /><h3>3. Generate a new migration</h3>Now you have to create a migration which, when run, will create the relevant tables in a structured manner.  You could also be hipster about it and edit SQL on your database by hand, but then you&#8217;d would have to tell the other people you&#8217;re working with of what you&#8217;ve done if they have local databases, or else run the same SQL on production databases.  With migrations, you can make changes modular, and even roll back changes easily.<br /><br />Run <code>rails g migration create_dogs_table</code>.  This will create a file in <strong>db/migrate</strong> which will look something like this: <br /><blockquote><strong>20110807213821_create_dogs_table.rb</strong></blockquote>The numbers on the left are a timestamp, which is needed by Active Record so it will know what migrations that you haven&#8217;t yet run, so that it can run them for you.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>4. Edit the migration file to describe what tables or columns should be added to your database.</h3>Open your migration file and type in these things: <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class CreateDogTable &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration<br />  def self.up<br />  end<br /><br />  def self.down<br />  end<br />end<br /></pre><code>self.up</code> is executed when a database is updated; <code>self.down</code> is executed when a database is rolled back due to errors.  So, in <code>self.up</code> you want to create your new tables and columns; in <code>self.down</code> you want to define code to remove those tables and columns.  With dog objects, all we said we cared about earlier was the name, so let&#8217;s just make a table which will (automatically) contain a unique ID, a timestamp, and a string for each dog object.  <br /><pre class="brush: cpp">class CreateDog &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration<br />  def self.up<br />    create_table :dogs do | d |<br />      d.timestamps<br />      d.string :name<br />    end<br />  end<br /><br />  def self.down<br />    drop_table :dogs<br />  end<br />end<br /></pre><br /><br /><h3>5. Run the migration to create your table</h3>Run the migration by typing <code>rake db:migrate</code>.  Remember how the migration that we generated had a timestamp?  When you run <code>rake db:migrate</code>, Active Record can use those to figure out all the migrations that might have been added to your code base, which have not yet been run on a certain database (such as the one pertaining to production).  Also, because the code to create and drop data from a database is so high-level, it doesn&#8217;t really matter whether your actual code is in sqlite3 or in MySQL.  You can even use both depending on whether you&#8217;re in development or production stages.<br /><br />Hurray!  Now you have new tables and columns in your database!  <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><br />Sources: <br /><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kellydunn">Kelly</a></li><li><a href="http://ar.rubyonrails.org/">RubyonRails.org: Active Record</a></li><li><a href="http://duanesbrain.blogspot.com/2006/05/ruby-on-rails-hasone-versus-belongsto.html">Duane&#8217;s Brain: Ruby on Rails : Has_One versus Belongs_To</a></li></ul></div>

Kelly has been being really hipster and avoiding auto-generating files :P But thanks!  Now that I know how to create stuff &quot;model dog&quot; should be easier.  Also, &quot;change&quot; sounds definitely more convenient.  Thanks!</div>

If you do &quot;rails g model dog&quot;, the model, migration, tests and test helper files are automatically generated.  <br /><br />Also, in Rails 3.1, you don&#39;t have to define both up and down methods if down is obvious from what up is.  You can just define a method &quot;change&quot; with the contents of &quot;up&quot; would have been, and rails can figure out &quot;down&quot; by itself.<br /><br />The only caveat is that if change is drop_table, you have to use down and up, because rails can&#39;t figure out what columns to add back if you roll back the drop.</div>

It was for a position that I felt was made for me &#8211; involving writing, drawing, design, some management too.  (Managing soothes me because I feel like I have an eye on everything that&#8217;s going on.) Despite my enthusiasm I think I still wasn&#8217;t able to explain myself properly, and I blame it in some part on Skype.  I struggle with communicating effectively over electronic things like phones and video-chats.  People&#8217;s eyes don&#8217;t meet, there are no visual cues, they don&#8217;t see that I&#8217;m fiddling with the cork of this delicious Cupcake Red Velvet wine that I finished yesterday as I think.<br /><br />The internet connection is faulty.  Did they understand what I said?  Did I really understand what they said?  Am I being too silly?  <em>Are my feelings of pure love for video game design and story reaching you through these pixels?</em><br /><br />Man, I love the comfort of words that you can think through before you write, then think through after you write, then revise if necessary.<br /><br />One thing they asked was for further demonstration of my ability to sketch things out in perspective, or make layouts, so after RPG today (every Tuesday with the other interns) I drew out a short rendition of Little Red Riding Hood, the whole of which you can view <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/post/8727734003/sf-day-43-mondays-man-sf-day-44-had-an">on Tumblr</a>, where it looks much prettier, thanks to the whole <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/08/good-design-moves-tumblr-has-made.html">tiled photosets</a> thing.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve drawn things &#8220;with perspective&#8221; since the endless corridors of elementary school, but these were fun to do. :)</div>

There is one thing in particular that I wish Skype would change about its UI, and I think it&#8217;s mostly influenced by my experience using another <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/05/playerio-thoughts-on-bigdb.html">2.0-y bright blue user interface</a>.<br /><br />I&#8217;m talking about the little side menu that comes up over your chat messages, which offers you a variety of possible actions for that message.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sgPTg-1XhdE/TkNONrn37eI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/ejBSr5mVeLw/s1600/skype2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="116" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sgPTg-1XhdE/TkNONrn37eI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/ejBSr5mVeLw/s640/skype2.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">man, I should have taken a bigger screenshot</td></tr></tbody></table><br />When I am clicking on my own chat, these are the things that I probably want to do, in order:<br /><br /><ol><li><b>Edit </b>whatever foolish, silly thing I just wrote</li><li><b>Remove</b>&nbsp;whatever now-irrelevant thing I just wrote</li></ol><div><br /></div><div>I can only imagine <b>Copy</b>&nbsp;or <b>Quote</b>&nbsp;to be useful in cases when I want to be snarky. &nbsp;(<i>I already said that! &nbsp;Exactly 5 minutes and 3 seconds ago!</i>) Or maybe if I&#8217;m cross-posting between chats? &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know. &nbsp;I accept there is a use case that I haven&#8217;t encountered for those options.</div><div><br /></div><div>Nevertheless, <b>what I really wish I could do in Skype is click <i>anywhere</i>&nbsp;on a chat-message of mine and have it open up into something I could immediately edit</b>, much like Player.IO&#8217;s treatment of objects in its database. &nbsp;The menu could then be reserved for the lesser use cases of Removing, Copying, or Quoting.</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of the menu, could we also make that little arrow larger? &nbsp;The little arrow that opens that menu in the first place?</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V7fU6z-5WlI/TkNNvNn6bMI/AAAAAAAAAWI/3vOz8JgvCK8/s1600/2011-08-10_1256.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="120" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V7fU6z-5WlI/TkNNvNn6bMI/AAAAAAAAAWI/3vOz8JgvCK8/s640/2011-08-10_1256.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">do you see it?</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>Since there&#8217;s nothing usually relevant to the right side of the chat-message anyway, it would help a lot if the hitbox for the menu was larger. &nbsp;Also, if the menu opened up automatically, instead of me having to click it&#8230;!</div><div><br /></div><div>Just thinking about it is exciting. :D</div></div>

<strong>Tiled Photosets</strong><br />If you wanted to post more than one picture at a time on Tumblr, it used to be that the pictures would be placed into a little slideshow applet.  It was really elegant and cute; you would see one picture at a time, and could press a little rounded arrow to move on to the next picture.<br /><br />The problem is, no one would use it.  Or at least, if people did post this way, it didn&#8217;t get interacted with.  (At least, I didn&#8217;t, and the rare frequency with which I met up with a photoset on my dashboard makes me think that others didn&#8217;t really like this method of posting either.)  On Tumblr people just scroll, scroll, scroll.  Occasionally laugh.  And don&#8217;t stop for your dang photosets.<br /><br />Then, suddenly!  A tiled photoset appears!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CZrjAQAmsGI/TkCxzPGtDgI/AAAAAAAAAVg/78Ui_m8CiTk/s1600/photoset.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="526" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CZrjAQAmsGI/TkCxzPGtDgI/AAAAAAAAAVg/78Ui_m8CiTk/s640/photoset.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">with varied photo sizes, even!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />All of a sudden, you can see all the pictures in a photoset at once!  Plus the given layouts for different pictures make them all look really artsy, which Tumblr users love, because let&#8217;s be honest, over half of us are there just reblogging stuff.  Though another mark of how cool this feature is is how people have taken creative liberties with it, making sets of images like <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/8598587153/flashinglightsandecstasy-lol-xd">this</a>, or <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/8572474978">this</a>, or even <a href="http://natsura.tumblr.com/post/8436544789">this</a>.<br /><br />Making a feature which fits with how people actually use the product, and allows them to be creative?  ++!<br /><br /><br /><strong>Reblogging Tags</strong><br />I actually just noticed this today.  Never again will I have to repopulate the tags of something that I&#8217;m reblogging.  As an example, <a href="http://textless.tumblr.com/">textless.tumblr</a> is a great blog for macro photography of insects (and other animals), and the photographer always dutifully tags all of his posts with whatever is pictured.  <em>Wooly Aphid.  Larva.  Wasp Mimic. Secropia Silkmoth.</em>  (These tags often even get cut off in the dashboard post.  I can&#8217;t find an example now, but may later.)  In any case, though I love the accuracy of it, no way am I going to spend any time tagging these reblogs with anything more than &#8220;photo&#8221; and maybe &#8220;bug.&#8221;<br /><br />Fortunately, now tags also get reblogged!  So, now reblogging things can make you feel even more productive with even less energy. :)<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S_bvkOlgoOE/TkC4Lq-KX2I/AAAAAAAAAVo/bnrweSPmG8E/s1600/photoset2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="258" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S_bvkOlgoOE/TkC4Lq-KX2I/AAAAAAAAAVo/bnrweSPmG8E/s400/photoset2.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">thanks, tumblr. &nbsp;you the bomb</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><strong>Edit:</strong><br />Now if only tags were easier to remove than pressing that teensy little X beside every rounded-corner box.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oWzXOJfPEgI/TkNLEo_SODI/AAAAAAAAAV4/7vyWJbuxfDA/s1600/tumblr3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oWzXOJfPEgI/TkNLEo_SODI/AAAAAAAAAV4/7vyWJbuxfDA/s400/tumblr3.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Edit 2:</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This feature was eventually removed.

@jshou I was thinking about it!  I was thinking I could probably make a set of my favorites on Flickr and then randomly populate them everytime that page loads.</div>

I&#8217;ve always been more of a cat person, but recently I&#8217;ve been mad for shiba inu.  I found one in the FarmVille suite and it made my day.  I&#8217;m too shy to visit him all the time, but it&#8217;s enough to see him now and again.<br /><br />I found another shiba at the company meeting, and, typical of shiba aloofness with strangers, he did not care in the slightest that I adored him.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-74D_Hl1tbpk/Ti-wzOFiDcI/AAAAAAAAAUE/ZcMr3K-nsoc/s1600/DSC_0119%2B%25282%2529.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-74D_Hl1tbpk/Ti-wzOFiDcI/AAAAAAAAAUE/ZcMr3K-nsoc/s640/DSC_0119%2B%25282%2529.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh whoa i found a stick lol nom nom nom</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I cannot really explain why I started loving shiba inu with the abruptness and ferocity with which I did despite my general &#8220;:|&#8221; feeling about dogs, but it probably has something to do with this video, at least initially:<br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_uIshkpeXko" width="425"></iframe></center><br /><br />(More videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL957844FC81969564&amp;feature=mh_lolz">here</a>!)<br /><br />During breaks at work I&#8217;ve been searching for shiba inu-related stuff to read, and found <a href="http://juicybits.com/Shosha/_history.php">History and Tradition of the Japanese Shiba-Inu by Julia Cadwell</a>.  It goes,<br /><br /><blockquote>Today’s Shiba has been bred by careful mixing of many strains of small Japanese dogs.</blockquote><br />And then,<br /><br /><blockquote>The first impression the Japanese Shiba Dog creates is a lack of sophistication—a touch of nature that has escaped human forced breeding. Actually the Japanese Shiba Dog has escaped much artificiality that accompanies improvement and fixation of species.</blockquote><br /><em>lol wat</em><br /><br />In other news, this idea of shiba inu being attractive because they are in part so wild and &#8220;not completely obedient&#8221; reminds me intensely of tea ceremony aestheticism, of the beauty it finds in odd numbers, in asymmetrical and lumpy pottery, in things that are perfect because of their imperfection.<br /><br />Finding a job and then finding a shibanakama are some of the reasons why I am excited to return home. :3</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;ve done a lot of exploring in San Francisco this past weekend, as my more city-savvy friends have returned from Japan.  One of them lamented having not known about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format">raws</a> before going, and we had a conversation about it, with me mostly being like, <em>Dude, raw may make your pictures better but so does having the proper aperture, shutter speed, white balance, ISO,</em> etc.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve only tried shooting raw once, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=11378171@N02&amp;q=%22golden%20gardens%22">with somewhat non-exceptional results</a>.  The only thing that came out of this experience was that raws took forever to edit (on my poor, slow computer) and I didn&#8217;t really see much difference in quality.<br /><br />Fast forward to exploration weekend, wherein I decided I would give raws another shot (if you will) and then realized that <em>they are really cool</em>.  There are <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/u-raw-files.shtml">other places</a> where you can learn exactly what raws are, so I won&#8217;t go into that here, but rather just talk about my experiences.<br /><br />What I found really amazing about the raw images that I took was the capacity that I had to edit them.  With my normal fine jpegs, I pretty much just threw them into Photoshop, and adjusted the middle bar of Levels slightly to the right to get rid of some of the grays.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hQG8cREC90M/Ti5OEXhbfvI/AAAAAAAAATE/b3uwemzEG4g/s1600/lessgraylol.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="198" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hQG8cREC90M/Ti5OEXhbfvI/AAAAAAAAATE/b3uwemzEG4g/s320/lessgraylol.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">now it&#8217;s less gray lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And that was about the extent of my editing, unless I was trying to fix white balance or whatever.  Occasionally I would touch the other two bars, but pictures would inevitably look way too bright or way too dark afterward.  Plus, editing was pretty linear &#8211; stuff as a whole would just keep getting brighter (and way too bright), or else much darker.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7Cj8Myg8VI/Ti5Op5X5iGI/AAAAAAAAATM/37N4R2Ll0eQ/s1600/lessgraylol2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7Cj8Myg8VI/Ti5Op5X5iGI/AAAAAAAAATM/37N4R2Ll0eQ/s320/lessgraylol2.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">now it&#8217;s more white lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Enter raws, which are apparently just like having an undeveloped shot of film, in which all its possibilities of exposure are retained.  Also enter the Conservatory of Flowers, which is what I did in order to take tons of pictures of flowers, despite the fact that flower picture-taking is uber-typical.  Here is my original photo of a flower &#8211;<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yEDrWjcps4w/Ti5Pdj-LUQI/AAAAAAAAATU/j7XaEkY1-HI/s1600/sunday72.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yEDrWjcps4w/Ti5Pdj-LUQI/AAAAAAAAATU/j7XaEkY1-HI/s320/sunday72.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />And here are two edited versions &#8211;<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_oo9KWAgCFM/Ti5PmQ47RyI/AAAAAAAAATc/mlRl2t_CTTI/s1600/sunday71.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_oo9KWAgCFM/Ti5PmQ47RyI/AAAAAAAAATc/mlRl2t_CTTI/s320/sunday71.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EuepuPwp_e4/Ti5PqbMa1UI/AAAAAAAAATk/wph0yhVEmK4/s1600/sunday73.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EuepuPwp_e4/Ti5PqbMa1UI/AAAAAAAAATk/wph0yhVEmK4/s320/sunday73.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><em>Where did all that detail come from?!</em><br /><br />Had I been editing a jpeg from that original, I assure you that the only thing I would have known how to do is make that shit even whiter than it already was.  Or else make everything around it as black as my soul.  Though I have to admit that a likely cause of this is just the fact that using Photoshop tools is like reaching for something in a huge, bubbling cauldron and slapping it on your picture &#8211; you don&#8217;t really know what you&#8217;re doing and you&#8217;re never really quite sure what will happen.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dtsf4qr3b74/Ti5RtKqc6dI/AAAAAAAAATs/Mg_gfs-UtA0/s1600/lolol.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dtsf4qr3b74/Ti5RtKqc6dI/AAAAAAAAATs/Mg_gfs-UtA0/s320/lolol.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">what wait oh no why</td></tr></tbody></table><br />On the other hand, the workflow for editing a raw in the Mac that I&#8217;m borrowing is pretty self-explanatory.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HDutWQ33XJ4/Ti5T4iYqylI/AAAAAAAAAT8/eQy32YMjnrI/s1600/cameraraw.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="211" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HDutWQ33XJ4/Ti5T4iYqylI/AAAAAAAAAT8/eQy32YMjnrI/s320/cameraraw.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh, so those are the things i can do?<br />and i can see what changes they make to the picture immediately?<br />okay.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Anyway.  My notable observations on raw are as follows:<br /><br /><ul><li>Raw files take up too much dang space. &nbsp;My 4GB memory card can handle 1,500+ fine JPEGs like a badass. &nbsp;It can hold about 400 raws.</li><li>This means that my normal methods of &#8220;TAKE AS MANY PICTURES AS YOU CAN AND MAYBE THREE OF THEM WILL BE OKAY&#8221; won&#8217;t work here.</li><li>Then again, the reason why I had to take so many pictures was because so many of them turned out irreversibly poor. &nbsp;And if I could <i>edit </i>them&#8230;</li><li>Even though it sucks to have less space, I don&#8217;t actually mind it &#8211; throughout this past weekend I found myself being more thoughtful about what pictures to take, and being more vicious about which ones to immediately delete if I didn&#8217;t like them. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not just memory that I need to take into account &#8211; it&#8217;s the fact that every picture I save will require some minutes of editing, which, in my busy busy day is worth &nbsp; a ton. &nbsp;I&#8217;m already two days behind in my&nbsp;<a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/30_day_challenge">San Francisco Summer thing</a>&nbsp;I&#8217;m trying to do.</li><li>Being more thoughtful in the actual picture-taking process is, to me, a refreshing change.</li><li>Plus, in the actual editing I really feel more connected and appreciative of each picture, and thus more like I&#8217;ve actually accomplished something meaningful for myself, etc.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>That being said, aside from pictures which will be explicitly harvested for panorama purposes, I think I&#8217;m going to do my best to stick to raw file formats as a default from now on, the same way that I moved somewhat mysteriously from always-auto to always-manual settings. &nbsp;Still, I think it&#8217;s important to have a handle on aperture/shutter speed/ISO and all that, since a raw file format can&#8217;t fix blur. &nbsp;(That I know of.) &nbsp;And you know me, I&#8217;m liek totally super pro photog, so listen up.</div></div>

It was a pretty interesting ride, around 3 and a half hours by BART and bus from San Francisco to Antioch, though most of it was waiting for the buses on a Sunday, when transportation in general is sparse.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O4qVxi104B0/TiU5_GGVllI/AAAAAAAAAS8/8cyoXf1Q4D4/s1600/DSC_0158.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O4qVxi104B0/TiU5_GGVllI/AAAAAAAAAS8/8cyoXf1Q4D4/s640/DSC_0158.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">moar teams</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It&#8217;s fun to be in a place where people are so passionate about a game that was released <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Brothers_Melee">almost 10 years ago</a>.  I spent the winter of sophomore year rabidly playing this game, trying to perfect my Pikachu and never quite getting the hang of wavedashing.  Andou taught me about all the big names in Smash and I even got to see Axe, who I don&#8217;t really know or follow but admire because his Pikachu is really good.  I attempted to figure out why, and it seems that fairs and dairs are bad with Pikachu?  Who knew.  They were so satisfying in the first Smash Brothers. :x<br /><br />The only thing that dimmed me a bit is the fact that the group that organizes Genesis is called &#8220;DBR,&#8221; which one of my friends admitted to me stands for &#8220;Death By Rape.&#8221;<br /><br />~___~<br /><br />&#8220;They&#8217;re really nice people,&#8221; Andou told me, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s true &#8211; the tournament is well-attended and well-beloved, it seems that relatives staffed the counter where they sold food and people were shaken and concerned when it turned out a fellow Smasher had been robbed at gunpoint one night.  It&#8217;s just sad that a word that stands for so much violence and pain has become so normalized in this community.  Walk by any television and it&#8217;s a litany of, &#8221;<em>SUCK HIS DICK!  YEAH!  HE GOT SO RAPED!</em>&#8221;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tega4Fk7sUs/TiUs6hweEwI/AAAAAAAAASc/QRoM2zZrwnQ/s1600/tumblr_lokfhpSnl81qdycalo1_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tega4Fk7sUs/TiUs6hweEwI/AAAAAAAAASc/QRoM2zZrwnQ/s640/tumblr_lokfhpSnl81qdycalo1_1280.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">when really you were just beaten in a video game<br /><i>by a dr. mario</i>, sure, but still</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Why is there such a close seemingly natural link in this community and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men">In Real Life</a> between sex and utter pwning of something?<br /><br />I was catching up with a friend and we were discussing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_(season_5)">the latest season of Dexter</a>, which involves a particularly hideous plotline involving the torture and murder of several women.  My friend admitted that, despite his general lack of sensitivity to on-screen violence, the repeated rape scenes in Dexter made him squeamish, but when I asked about what he felt about the casual use of &#8220;rape&#8221; in games he pretty much shrugged it off.  It&#8217;s normal usage.  It&#8217;s not really thought of in <em>that way</em>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-om35AtlMmAY/TiUwzDP4HbI/AAAAAAAAASk/UJwt5liOFzE/s1600/tumblr_lokfhpSnl81qdycalo3_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-om35AtlMmAY/TiUwzDP4HbI/AAAAAAAAASk/UJwt5liOFzE/s640/tumblr_lokfhpSnl81qdycalo3_1280.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">he just got raped, dude.  that&#8217;s all</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I guess it&#8217;s nice to be able to just shrug off and trivialize <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2011/jul/15/democratic-congo-male-rape">traumatic injustices</a>.  It pains me that a group filled with genuinely nice people would work under such a name.  <em>Death By Being Physically Violated Until the Last Breath Leaves Your Body.</em><br /><br />I was discussing potential alternatives with Andou and this one is my favorite.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GgGFJxkoyZ0/TiU4uzUm--I/AAAAAAAAASs/CfkYfO5Z6iQ/s1600/dbr.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GgGFJxkoyZ0/TiU4uzUm--I/AAAAAAAAASs/CfkYfO5Z6iQ/s320/dbr.png" width="297" /></a></div></div>
