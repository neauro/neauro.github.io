<p>I can&rsquo;t really help being the type of person who would be totally satisfied for hours finding stuff to dig up and feed to digital creatures. That you get to do this in <a href="http://www.mightanddelight.com/index.php?page=shelter">Shelter</a> while waddling around as a squat creature, followed by five other smaller squat creatures, is an unexpectedly satisfying plus.</p>

<p>In Shelter, you play the role of a mother badger tasked with foraging and protecting five little badger babbus. Shelter is So Pretty, though the lack of contrast was occasionally hard on my eyes, and confused my gameplay. For example, since you are cued to hungry babbus by looking at which one is less saturated than the others, I think I ended up overfeeding the babbu with a pattern that consistently made it look pale/hungry, even when it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>[spoilers ahead]</p>

<p>I was determined to bring all my babbus through the game, but unfortunately lost one to the river, one to fire, and one to the hawk at the end. I wasn&rsquo;t too surprised by the game&rsquo;s bitterwsweet ending, but wish it had been performed differently — for one thing, I kept getting lost running back and forth between those final grasses — would it have been possible to do something like desaturate the direction from which you&rsquo;d come, to make the forest endgame more obvious and maybe even ~paradisical~?</p>

<p class="caption">so paradise</p>


<p>It was also a shame to be picked off &ldquo;against my will&rdquo; at the end — thinking about it now, it would have been cool to maybe hear a babbu shriek, and then look back to see that a hawk is struggling to carry it away. By the end of the game, the babbus are pretty heavy after all — maybe capable of giving a good thrash — and at that point you could make the choice to go back and try to fight the bird off, at which point it gives you a couple good swipes and then lifts you away to continue the circle of life.</p>

<p class="caption">good luck my sweets</p>


<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to Shelter 2, mostly because you&rsquo;ll be able to run without fear of leaving babbus behind to fend for themselves. Also, <em>those little mewling noises in the trailer</em>.</p>

<p>I played <a href="http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/">Monument Valley</a> carefully, slowly, with headphones, trying to savor it. It&rsquo;s tough with puzzle games, because if something takes you a little more effort than your flow state allows, your vision narrows, and it&rsquo;s tough to think about anything except stuff like <em>HOW DO I GET THROUGH THAT DOOR AUAUUGHHH</em></p>

<p>In Monument Valley, you lead (are?) Ida, a &ldquo;silent princess,&rdquo; through a geometrically implausible landscape. The game has very nice UI built in to facilitate you taking screenshots, which is a good feature for getting the word out. It&rsquo;s fairly innocuous, since you <em>do</em> start to feel like you want to share where you&rsquo;ve been in the game, even if it isn&rsquo;t the sort of thing used for making unique creations.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/monument2.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Monument Valley"/></p>

<p class="caption">here's another screenshot, because i took a lot of them and consider them all gorg</p>


<p>The screenshot feature has the added benefit of guiding your player into how they should feel about the game too. <em>This scene is pretty. Appreciate it!</em> Emails sent with screenshots are loaded with the message &ldquo;Wish you were here,&rdquo; which is pretty cute.</p>

<p>My favorite bits (with spoilers):</p>

<ul>
<li>The title card &ldquo;flavors,&rdquo; especially IN WHICH A THRONE LIES VACANT and IN WHICH THERE IS NOBODY LEFT TO FORGIVE US. These are the game&rsquo;s last-subtle aspects, and though I can&rsquo;t say with any specificity what they refer to (and would have preferred if I could), I like the poetry of them, and their ominousness.</li>
<li>Meeting your Yellow Block Friend. I loved how Ida would touch them when they were standing together. And I also loved watching them sink under the ocean, only to return later during the descent — so good! Their plodding after you until totally overtaken by watery vectors was pleasantly heartbreaking.</li>
<li>The whole &ldquo;music box&rdquo; level, as well as the levels in general where you start without knowing where Ida is. It makes the geometry of the game — and Ida&rsquo;s navigation through it — a little more &ldquo;impossible.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>The trailer was gorgeous and I&rsquo;m a sucker for both folklore and foxes, so I played <a href="http://neveralonegame.com/">Never Alone</a> this weekend. I started on my own and, after getting trapped in an area where character AI wasn&rsquo;t quite cutting it (and kept dropping me into an icy demise), I set up a controller so I could play with a human. (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1l21zb/playing_with_a_ps3_controller_on_pc_a_setup_guide">It&rsquo;s pretty easy, by the way!</a>)</p>

<p>It turned out to be fortunate trouble because the game is much more fun with someone else, though I admit that this could also be because I rarely play multi-player games nowadays and hugely prefer them to be cooperative when I do. The atmosphere and Iñupiaq narration were fantastic, and I loved the subtlety of certain details, such as the little halo of light that emerged from the fox&rsquo;s head whenever a spirit was near. Certain things didn&rsquo;t quite make sense — why do the spirits of the aurora fly away with you? If it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re doing something &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; what is that bad thing you&rsquo;re doing? — but it helps contributes to the surrealism that surrounds old stories.</p>

<p>I only wish the game was longer than the three hours it took us to complete it. Hopefully it&rsquo;s successful enough to warrant the creation of further chapters, and inspires others to find new ways to share their cultural stories as well. I know I&rsquo;d love to see a game with the Filipino pantheon, despite (or even because) of its incredible diversity and tension with Christianity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I always said before that I was busy with school but it doesn&rsquo;t compare at all to the amount of work I have now, just a couple weeks until graduation. AAAAHHH</p>

<p>Lots has been happening. Even so, I&rsquo;ve been posting pretty frequently on <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> (as it requires less effort and being able to arrange photos nicely is fun).</p>

<p>In particular I&rsquo;ve been working on my Capstone project, Bubble, an app to faciliate easier sharing of photos and messages between iPhone users using mesh networking (the same kind that <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/525921/the-latest-chat-app-for-iphone-needs-no-internet-connection/">Firechat</a> has been making use of). I&rsquo;ve been writing about my team&rsquo;s progress in our own <a href="http://hcdeevee.tumblr.com/">process blog</a>, and I&rsquo;ve also posted <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/code-eevee">in-progress stuff</a> about my own sketches and experiments with Sketch 3 and Flinto. Sketch 3 is fantastic, and I find myself opening it even when I just need to do a couple quick photo edits. Flinto is also great, though I&rsquo;m disappointed that I&rsquo;ll probably never &ldquo;really&rdquo; use it after my trial runs out, because $20 a month is a little much for someone who just wants to play with flows that I won&rsquo;t get paid for. I wish there was a way to pay up front and only have one active project or something. As it is, I&rsquo;m keeping an eye on <a href="http://proto.io/">Proto.io</a> and <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel App</a> for future playing. (Though I still loove <a href="https://popapp.in/">Pop App</a> right now for interactive paper prototyping.)</p>

<p>Other than capstone work, I&rsquo;ve also been working on a lot of fun design projects for my Interaction Design class this quarter, which I&rsquo;ll post about separately later.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been writing a ton! A month ago the &ldquo;Plague&rdquo; theme edition of <a href="http://strayingfromreality.wordpress.com/">AU</a> was released, which had my story <em>Iron &amp; Honey</em>. It&rsquo;s available currently at Bulldog News.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/ironandhoney.jpg" alt="The first page of 'Iron and Honey'"/></p>

<p class="caption">The first page of <em>Iron &amp; Honey</em></p>


<p>I&rsquo;ve also been working on my Big Story with greater headway than I have before by using the &ldquo;writing scene-by-scene&rdquo; technique which I read about in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=story+robert+mckee+&oq=story+robert+mckee+&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59l4j0.2336j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8"><em>Story</em> by Robert McKee</a>. The way that I’m executing is by writing out each scene with a “beginning state” of certain characters, their “ending” state, and the exposition or other “feeling” work that needs to also happen.</p>

<p>My problem with Big Story is that I love my world and my characters and I know what I want to say, but I have no idea how to say it, and no idea how to get from my known point A to point B. Hopefully working out each step like this will help me actually get somewhere. I’ve had problems dragging mindlessly from A to B with all my previous iterations, but with this kind of technique I can already feel myself becoming more conscious of how to make making meaningful things happen the whole way through.</p>

<p class="caption">yay! things happening!</p>


<p>The final major happening in my life is the release of <a href="http://supergiantgames.com/index.php/transistor/">Transistor</a>! (≧▽≦ I spent the Monday prior its release this week listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KudXO0DO04U&feature=youtu.be&t=5m42s">We All Become</a> on repeat, more of a fangirl about this than any other game than I can think of. I&rsquo;m about 4 hours in and have already had a heart-swelling experience that reduced me into a puddle of sap. I&rsquo;m not done yet but I love it I love it and it&rsquo;s incredibly inspiring. I can only hope the good feels stay until the end.</p>

<p><em>Thomas Was Alone</em> was super cute, if more ambiguous than I personally like. I liked the personality given to all the different shapes, though their common heroism and conceit got a little old as the game went on, which was why Laura&rsquo;s cynicism made her my favorite (though I felt compelled inexlicably to keep calling her &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo;). I loved that the levels were tilted, the play of light, the strange colors. (Though I wonder if any colorblind users had a hard time playing?)</p>

<p>One thing I think the game could have been improved was the game&rsquo;s sense of progression; though numbers ticked up each level, after a while they became meaningless, and now that the game is finished I&rsquo;m not totally sure what I would use them for. The introduction of each of the colored shapes, Thomas&rsquo;s &ldquo;death,&rdquo; and the era of the gray shapes seemed to be the largest movements in the story, and though each was accompanied with a fun snippet of &ldquo;The AIs are gaining sentience!&rdquo; flavor I didn&rsquo;t really have a sense that things were reaching their end until the end came suddenly to meet me. Some levels seemed like little &ldquo;drabbles&rdquo; and experiments, which I completed without much more effort than would take for me to click a cow in Farmville, and it would have been cool to see something else related to AIs breaking their previous ways of being. Breaking through the borders of levels — intentionally disobeying orders — something to add to the flavor text.</p>

<p>I played <em>Thomas Was Alone</em> on a projector and if you have the opportunity to do so yourself I recommend it. All those rectangles are like way better when they&rsquo;re as big as your face.</p>
