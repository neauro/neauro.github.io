  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<i>This quarter I am facilitating a game design class at Puget Sound Community School for fun and lols. &nbsp;This is my story.</i><br /><br /><i>Other weeks can be found <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">here</a>.</i><br /><br />First thing last Tuesday was going over last week&#8217;s assigned game, <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/586994">Pixel 2</a>, which has some marvelously colorful particle effects. &nbsp;Since we had talked a bit about <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/01/pscs-game-design-class-week-2.html">tutorials</a>&nbsp;in the past class, I had asked everybody to keep an eye on how Pixel 2 teaches you how to play the game, and it turns out it does so pretty bluntly.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ypu35aRRuI0/Tx4n4pMgrUI/AAAAAAAAAnM/XCTY9HfIHbE/s1600/pixel2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="468" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ypu35aRRuI0/Tx4n4pMgrUI/AAAAAAAAAnM/XCTY9HfIHbE/s640/pixel2.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">pixel 2 tutorial screenshot</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Everyone agreed that the game was &#8220;pretty fun,&#8221; mostly because it was very satisfying to collect the pixels, and people enjoyed the way that pixels were shot out at enemies anytime you collected pixels. &nbsp;We also discovered the &#8220;teleportation&#8221; aspect of the game, but were mixed about whether it added to the game or not. &nbsp;The player is moved around with the mouse, and can be held stationary with the space bar while the mouse moves the gun around, shooting at surrounding enemies; but if you release the space bar, the player will automatically &#8220;teleport&#8221; to the mouse&#8217;s present position.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t get that far in the game due to lack of time and the fact that all the particles make my laptop run slowly, but the students also pointed out that some of the upgrades obtained in the game later are unlabeled, so their function is hard to remember.<br /><br />After that, we moved on to the topic for the day, which was reward systems. &nbsp;I referenced a lot of <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2005/08/designing_rewar.html">this overview on reward types</a>, though the students were able to name off some rewards easily: leveling up, getting money, getting new items, getting to explore new places. &nbsp;I talked about schedules for rewards, as well as what I felt was a pretty interesting point from that article:<br /><br /><blockquote>If you have ever wondered why games with poor game mechanics can still entertain players, it is perhaps because many poorly designed games are at least easy to play - and if they provide rewards according to a reliable schedule, they will entertain&#8230;it is the delivery of rewards, and not the quality of the game mechanics, which maintains a player&#8217;s interest.</blockquote><br />Case in point: &nbsp;FarmVille, and other games nowadays like EA&#8217;s Theme Park which rely on people optimizing for rewards (described with a fair amount of pessimism in <a href="http://insertcredit.com/2011/09/22/who-killed-videogames-a-ghost-story/">who killed video games?</a>).<br /><br />The next thing I talked about was how the rewards mentioned above were all extrinsic motivations, contrasted with intrinsic motivations, detailed wonderfully in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">this TEDTalk about &#8220;the surprising science of motivation&#8221;</a>:<br /><br /><br /><center><object height="374" width="526"> <param name="movie" value="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf"> </param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /> <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/> <param name="wmode" value="transparent"> </param><param name="bgColor" value="#ffffff"> </param><param name="flashvars" value="vu=http://video.ted.com/talk/stream/2009G/Blank/DanielPink_2009G-320k.mp4&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/DanielPink-2009G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&vw=512&vh=288&ap=0&ti=618&lang=&introDuration=15330&adDuration=4000&postAdDuration=830&adKeys=talk=dan_pink_on_motivation;year=2009;theme=the_creative_spark;theme=not_business_as_usual;event=TEDGlobal+2009;tag=Business;tag=Science;tag=brain;tag=creativity;tag=social+change;tag=work;&preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;" /> <embed src="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" pluginspace="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" bgColor="#ffffff" width="526" height="374" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" flashvars="vu=http://video.ted.com/talk/stream/2009G/Blank/DanielPink_2009G-320k.mp4&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/DanielPink-2009G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&vw=512&vh=288&ap=0&ti=618&lang=&introDuration=15330&adDuration=4000&postAdDuration=830&adKeys=talk=dan_pink_on_motivation;year=2009;theme=the_creative_spark;theme=not_business_as_usual;event=TEDGlobal+2009;tag=Business;tag=Science;tag=brain;tag=creativity;tag=social+change;tag=work;&preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;"></embed> </object></center><br /><br />As soon as I described the candle problem one of the students yelled, &#8220;What?! &nbsp;But that&#8217;s easy!&#8221; right off the bat, so I guess it just goes to show you how they&#8217;ve already been brought up with fancy intrinsic motivations (or maybe it just proves that I shouldn&#8217;t have drawn the box first, and then the tacks inside the box).<br /><br />Last topic was goals, the discussion of which I also referenced <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2007/05/process_without.html">Only a Game</a>&nbsp;as well as relevant HCI/UX points like <i>Show your player how far they&#8217;ve gotten! &nbsp;Show them all the things they&#8217;ve done! &nbsp;Short-term goals and long-term goals and transparent progress, yeah!</i><br /><br />With most topics I usually stop to let everyone try and see what video games may exhibit characteristics of whatever I&#8217;m talking about, which leads inevitably to fun tangential discussion about WoW, about achievements, about gamification and whether it works or not. &nbsp;The only unfortunate thing is that I haven&#8217;t played most of the games that they have, since the only console I own that came out in the past seven years is the Wii. &nbsp;Even playing flash games stresses out the machines I own.<br /><br />Another thing I learned personally is this: even if the class is going to be mostly discussion and mostly me talking, even if there&#8217;s no formal note-taking or tests, it&#8217;s<i>&nbsp;good </i>to be writing stuff on the board. &nbsp;The moment I markered out &#8220;extrinsic&#8221; people looked up from their laptop screens. &nbsp;Hurray!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--czAH4cCqME/Tx5KxR4KxbI/AAAAAAAAAn0/cI6PcDeoEXI/s1600/goodreads.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--czAH4cCqME/Tx5KxR4KxbI/AAAAAAAAAn0/cI6PcDeoEXI/s1600/goodreads.jpg" /></a></div><br />I&#8217;ve been a member of it since 2008, but it wasn&#8217;t until recently that I found any affection for <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>, a social networking website based on readers and writers. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t been able to find many people to interact with on it; for me, the greatest value is simply in being able to keep a list of books that I&#8217;ve read, and how much I like them, based on a simple scale of 1 to 5 stars.<br /><br />A scale of 1 to 5 is pretty limited, but can still mean different things to everyone, which is why I like that Goodreads has a little dialog hover helpfully over the stars when you&#8217;re judging them. &nbsp;1 star, it says, stands for <i>I&nbsp;didn&#8217;t like it.</i>&nbsp; 2, for <i>It was OK. &nbsp;</i>3: <i>I liked it.</i>&nbsp; 4: <i>I really liked it.</i>&nbsp; And 5: <i>It was amazing.</i><br /><br />My personal rating system goes like this:<br /><br /><ul><li>1 &#8211; <i>I didn&#8217;t like it.</i> &nbsp;This book made me ill. &nbsp;Reading it may have caused my opinion of humanity to degrade. &nbsp;I would grimace when remembering it, and anti-recommend it, fiercely. &nbsp;Examples: <i>Wild Animus, Bloodborn, Hot Gimmick S.</i></li><li>2 &#8211; <i>It was okay.</i> &nbsp;I wouldn&#8217;t read it again or recommend it, but there was some slight redeeming quality about it, even if it was just that it featured a fetish motif (ex. shapeshifters). &nbsp;Examples: <i>Other, Abandoned, Dead Until Dark.</i></li><li>3 &#8211; <i>I liked</i>&nbsp;<i>it.</i>&nbsp; Reserved for books which kept me turning pages, but in the end were really just so-so. &nbsp;Examples: <i>Pants on Fire, A Lion Among Men, The Eye of the World.</i></li><li>4 &#8211; <i>I really liked it.</i>&nbsp; Given to books which kept me hungry for more, and<i>&nbsp;</i>were well-written, and had me sitting back dazed for a little after finishing.&nbsp;Examples:&nbsp;<i>Delirium, Wintergirls, The Alchemist.</i></li><li>5 &#8211; <i>It was amazing. </i>&nbsp;My label for books that <i>changed my life,</i>&nbsp;whether in terms of writing style, basic habits, or perceptions of morality/reality/x-ality. &nbsp;Examples being: <i>The Time-Traveler&#8217;s Wife, Perdido Street Station, The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma.</i></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>I read a quote somewhere I can&#8217;t find now; the point of it was that it is unproductive to read a book and then wonder to yourself whether you liked it or not. &nbsp;My takeaway from the idea was that judgment is less productive than analysis &#8211; that is, it&#8217;s infinitely better to say, <i>&#8220;I liked X for Y reasons,&#8221;</i>&nbsp;both for yourself and for the writer as well, since the writer is given the opportunity to improve. &nbsp;But as Goodreads is a social network not just for readers but for writers (with little qualifying labels next to their names), I hesitate at leaving qualitative feedback. &nbsp;Writers are real! &nbsp;And they have feelings! &nbsp;I don&#8217;t want to hurt those. &nbsp;Plus, popular books often have a multitude of reviews praising this or decrying that; I can&#8217;t see myself adding anything of value to the discussions, especially when ratings in these cases have usually fallen into an equilibrium rating of 4 or so.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll finish with a quote from <i>A Room of One&#8217;s Own</i>&nbsp;by Virginia Woolf:</div><blockquote>At any rate, where books are concerned, it is notoriously difficult to fix labels of merit in such a way that they do not come off.  Are not reviews of current literature a perpetual illustration of the difficulty of judgment?  &#8220;This great book,&#8221; &#8220;this worthless book,&#8221; the same book is called by both names.  Praise and blame alike mean nothing.  No, delightful as the pastime of measuring may be, it is the most futile of all occupations, and to submit to the decrees of the measurers the most servile of attitudes.  So long as you write what you wish to write, that is all that matters; and whether it matters for ages or only for hours, nobody can say.</blockquote></div>

Last Tuesday was day two of the <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">game design class</a> I&#8217;m facilitating at <a href="http://pscs.org/">PSCS</a>. Having no experience teaching game design, it&#8217;s mostly an experiment, an exercise in semi-public speaking, and a way for me to talk more about game design, which I really like.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yc0bvPPVwkE/TxJ3WaiffmI/AAAAAAAAAmk/xQZlYahQ7zg/s1600/five5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="322" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yc0bvPPVwkE/TxJ3WaiffmI/AAAAAAAAAmk/xQZlYahQ7zg/s640/five5.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/586264">five/5</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Last week I had the students watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAoW9fjKmo4">Wolfire&#8217;s design critique of World of Goo</a>, and then assigned everybody (including myself) to play ()<a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/586264">Five/5</a>, a game we chose at random from the front page of Newgrounds. We were all going to return and talk about it, and these were the major points we came up with about the game:<br /><br /><ul><li>the graphics and sound are nice</li><li>the mechanic was fun to figure out and work with</li><li>except the part where the background patterns (varied, moving, and eye-catching) mislead you in thinking they&#8217;re relevant, which they aren&#8217;t, in that some of us were able to finish without giving them a second thought</li><li>and, there was also a pretty high uncertainty about whether the game was fundamentally buggy.</li></ul><br />Apparently, even after thinking they&#8217;re uncovered the secret of the continuity mechanism, there were still times in which two pieces of perfectly-fitting-together map did not allow free passage between them. &nbsp;This suggests the game may have fared better with a little more feedback; that is, if it had somehow told you when you were doing things wrong (maybe by flashing that nice background), maybe you would be able to differentiate between when you were doing something wrong, or when you were doing something right and the game was messing up (unless the game was <i>really</i>&nbsp;buggy).<br /><br />The main idea I wanted to discuss this time was that you need to design for your players, so I also had them take the <a href="http://survey.ihobo.com/BrainHex/">Brainhex</a>&nbsp;questionnaire for funsies to see what type of gamer they were. &nbsp;Apparently this class is chock full of Mastermind/Conqueror/Achiever types, but someone pointed out quickly that they felt more like a Seeker, and we made a disassociation between identities and behaviors (i.e. it&#8217;s more important to design for an &#8220;Achiever behavior&#8221; rather than &#8220;an Achiever person,&#8221; since everyone may want different things at different times). &nbsp;We talked about AI difficulty and what types of behaviors it might please or not. &nbsp;For example, an AI in a racing game which slows down or speeds up depending on how well or poorly a player is doing would help a novice player because they wouldn&#8217;t feel so strongly the sting of defeat. &nbsp;Someone with Conqueror behavior, however, who loves epic wins, would find an AI that sticks close to her back bumper frustrating &#8211; she would only ever win by a hair. &nbsp;(I got this example from a website whose link I&#8217;ve misplaced, but I&#8217;ll credit it soon.)<br /><br />I also talked about PhotoCity (of course!) and the unexpected behaviors that may occur from players. &nbsp;Our game meant for casual crowdsourcing, became instead a tool for the hardcore player way into 3d building reconstruction. &nbsp;The &#8220;playtest&#8221; took the game to a place way different than we expected! &nbsp;Whoa! &nbsp;See all the amazing things that can happen after playtesting?<br /><br />At some point I ran out of things to talk about and had some minutes left so I talked about tutorials, heavily referencing <a href="http://www.auntiepixelante.com/?p=465">this</a>&nbsp;cool article. &nbsp;I first asked what the students knew about tutorials and they explained they didn&#8217;t have much need of them, since they already knew how to play games for the most part; when they got to a new one, they just clicked through.<br /><br />Me: &#8220;Well, there had to be a time when you <i>didn&#8217;t</i>&nbsp;know how to play games already. &nbsp;What was the first game you played?&#8221;<br /><br />One of them: &#8220;I think&#8230;yeah, it was Grand Theft Auto 3.&#8221;<br /><br />Oh&#8230;oh.<br /><br />&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you guys ever played Mario?!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;A little,&#8221; they admitted. &nbsp;&#8220;I haven&#8217;t beaten it.&#8221;<br /><br />I drew the first level of Mario on the board anyway and talked a little, and before I knew it, class was up.<br /><br />I still feel weird about this &#8211; I feel simultaneously like there&#8217;s not enough to talk about, or not enough interesting things to talk about which don&#8217;t involve flashing lights and nice graphics, which is untrue. &nbsp;At the same time, rather than talk about articles and writing, I wish that I could teach them about paper prototyping, or really try and design a game out that they could program. &nbsp;But I guess an hour a week for nine weeks has its limitations, and it&#8217;s good to start somewhere.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Last Saturday I played Arkham Horror for the first time.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cjGeAWMrb4k/TxJ9LLf6SoI/AAAAAAAAAms/Mc31jp8yRtU/s1600/5512bbd839a111e1abb01231381b65e3_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cjGeAWMrb4k/TxJ9LLf6SoI/AAAAAAAAAms/Mc31jp8yRtU/s320/5512bbd839a111e1abb01231381b65e3_7.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 13px;">i HAD to be the author</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I&#8217;ve heard that it&#8217;s a good game so it won&#8217;t be new to say that I enjoyed it. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t usually play board games, though when I think back on my elementary school days I remember that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSorry!_(game)&amp;ei=y30ST9KDJ6TfiALS59zADQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEA1221dP1EPMUJc6DFyN_TNh2Z5g&amp;sig2=81dpv9-O-QF5NsBTfHcYPQ">Sorry!</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMouse_Trap_(board_game)&amp;ei=s30ST8r4E-OjiQKjzoG7DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEagI_wcwiYKxMAIwenxQXTQy6W1A&amp;sig2=avE2_oH1q64NvDhdx6f9yg">Mouse Trap</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)">Uno</a> (which kinda counts, right?) took up the majority of my free time in Latchkey during the pre-Gameboy era. &nbsp;The most surprising thing about board games now, I have to say, is that the pieces are made of such sturdy material &#8211; layers of cardboard with this very pleasant hard matte/muslin texture. &nbsp;Then again, maybe it&#8217;s because this is a Grown Up&#8217;s game.<br /><br />Things I liked about Arkham Horror:<br /><br /><ul><li>Flavor! &nbsp;The names of places, what you could do in those places, the characters and their abilities, the subtle things written on the cards which explained just enough to chill your mind without sounding cheesy. &nbsp;<i>You suddenly realize the purpose of the sharp instrument. &nbsp;Shuddering, you place it back. &nbsp;Lose one Sanity Point and gain one Clue Token.</i></li><li>Cooperation &#8211; time has weakened my tolerance for competitive board games. &nbsp;Now I just love working together to achieve common goals.</li><li>Being able to change your character&#8217;s stats every upkeep &#8211; because it&#8217;s nice to not be totally locked into a build.</li><li>The possibility of (fun) epic failure &#8211; something that I think is way easier to accomplish in video games than in a board game. &nbsp;In video games, things can explode with flash and fluff when you miscalculate; in Arkham Horror, you&#8217;ve got the Ancient Ones and your imagination. &nbsp;And the fact that whatever Ancient One that awoke is now screwing everybody over immensely with negative buffs and Endless enemies.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>In general, the game had just the right amount of complexity &#8211; enough to keep you on your toes, not so much that you were glancing at the rulebook every time you wanted to do something (though we did reach for the rulebook a non-negligible number of times). &nbsp;</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
The field of Human-Computer Interaction started in the 1980s, borne of cognitive and computer science.  It started with the idea that humans and computers both have behaviors that are algorithmic, and at a human&#8217;s heart is a little processor chipping away at data and outputting actions accordingly.  Around this time, Xerox came out with The Graphical User Interface. &nbsp;It was a novel framework for user interaction, and people were like, &#8220;Whoa!&#8221; And thus was cognitive science applied to improving GUIs by the millions.<br /><br />Soon, however, people became dissatisfied.  HCI as it was, hand-in-hand with cognitive sciences, was as limited as a college girl off at Ivy League and still dating someone in senior year of high school.  They had a lot of good moments the past year, they had some times that were defining of each other&#8217;s identity, but in the end, HCI just needed to broaden out, because humans don&#8217;t have processor hearts.  Suchman (in <em>Plans and Situated Actions</em>) was arguing with AI researchers in the dorm hallway and HCI, having left her door open for potential visitors, overheard.<br /><br />&#8220;Human action is &#8216;situated,&#8217;&#8221; Suchman said.  Humans respond to opportunity when it knocks, and are flexible to a change in resources.  &#8220;Computer programs may follow algorithms, but people do not.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Just look,&#8221; Suchman said, &#8220;at all these people who struggled with the design of this photocopier (1987).  If people were <em>truly</em> algorithmic, they would have tried to solve their usability problems in the same way.&#8221; Alas, everyone found their way to hatred of this copy-machine in a multitude of ways.<br /><br />This idea, this <em>situatedness</em>, drew right from Ethnomethodology, the guy in the opposite hallway, who grew up with nice sociology parents but had somehow turned out to be unusually rebellious and anti-theoretical.  He was all about moment-by-moment actions analyzed as reponses to events in a &#8220;local scene of action.&#8221; He was all about figuring out what made you (or groups of you) tick, and making you efficient, consistent, coherent.  He was best friends with Anthropology, whose whole life was about having comprehensive knowledge about every acquaintance and passerby.<br /><br />Ethnomethodology was pretty cool, but his parents never got over it.  They couldn&#8217;t compromise.  They tried to keep other people away from him, and to this day Ethnomethodology remained relegated to &#8220;a radical antitheory position.&#8221;  His wish to work above generalization and abstraction were shoved into a corner, and eventually even Anthropology, once a wide-eyed fact-hoarder, left and became theoretical herself.<br /><br />It was alright.  Ethnomethodology continued.  He focused.  He loved conversation, eventually produced rules about it: &#8220;turn-taking,&#8221; &#8220;repair,&#8221; &#8220;back-channeling.&#8221; In doing so he embraced something his parents had always wanted: generalization.  Soon he was spouting things like &#8220;highlighting for perception&#8221; and &#8220;professional vision,&#8221; and every multi-syllable ambiguity sent him an inch further down &#8220;the slippery slope of theorizing.&#8221;<br /><br />But it wasn&#8217;t enough for the kind of foundational theory HCI was really looking for.  HCI hung out with him a couple times, but as the years went on their interactions degenerated from brief hellos, strained smalltalk, unanswered Facebook Event invites.  Ethnomethodology had an &#8220;attitude of indifference&#8221; which didn&#8217;t seem that stable.  HCI kept a memory of empirical studies, of software usage data, but eventually all those nights she spent with him underneath the moon, talking &#8211; just, <em>talking</em>, about anything &#8211; faded.<br /><br />HCI <i>needed</i> that foundational theory. &nbsp;She wanted to learn more, not just about herself and her many facets (Psychology, Sociology, Computer Science, and so on), but about what she wanted to <em>do</em> with her life.  It wasn&#8217;t so much about trying to make all these different parts of her speak on the same level, but more about having an understanding of her own identity above them all.  Without theory she couldn&#8217;t compare the past to the present, couldn&#8217;t learn about whether she was really becoming better.  She couldn&#8217;t know whether her next step forward was actually a step back.  She couldn&#8217;t know whether some pet peeve of hers was typical, couldn&#8217;t decide what was important.<br /><br />Without theory, she couldn&#8217;t be as good as Science, who was not useful because she was always real or always right, but because she was always helpful and wanted.  Science could stumble, could even make mistakes: but even those missteps led to progress.<br /><br /><br /><br />Source:<br />Kaptelini &amp; Nardi, <em>Acting with Technology: Activity Theory and Interaction Design.</em> 2009.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yesterday I facilitated my first class at the <a href="http://pscs.org/">Puget Sound Community School</a> (PSCS). The class is called &#8220;Make Games: Design,&#8221; and is a companion to Alex&#8217;s &#8220;Make Games: Programming,&#8221; previous iterations of which <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2010/10/teaching-flixel.html">written about before</a>.<br /><br />There are four boys in the class. I had been hoping to intrigue some girls into it, and during my pitch before the school kept eyeing the ones in the front row.  <i>Yeah!  Girls can play games too!  Check it ouuutt!  </i>In retrospect, I realize that I might have erred in my pitch by not mentioning that our discussions will not center around the intricacies of triple-A titles these girls may have never heard of, much less played. Saying that might have made the class seem more accessible. As it was, the kids that joined my class were all those that had been huddled in the back of the room on their laptops.<br /><br />Which isn&#8217;t a bad thing; it just makes me wince a little to see a group of laptop kids completely girl-less.  Then again, girls don&#8217;t all have to like computers.<br /><br />Anyway, the class was off to a good start.  My four students are incredibly bright and eager to participate in a way that&#8217;s refreshing and relieving &#8211; after all, I&#8217;ve myself been a part of a wordless classroom a teacher is trying to engage.  After introductions, I asked what everyone&#8217;s favorite games were, and why.  By the end, we had talked about Portal 2, WoW, Skyrim, Skyward Sword, The Darkness, and they all had good keywords to say about the games &#8211; things like, <i>This game was good because of its goals &#8211; because of its progression &#8211; because there&#8217;s always brand new content &#8211; because of good feedback&#8230;</i><br /><br />And, inversely, <i>This game [Skyward Sword] was bad because they had this whole world you could explore, except not really because all you could find were these treasure chests you couldn&#8217;t even interact with&#8230;</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />Something that I heard too often for my taste were things like <i>This game is just AWESOME!</i>  Somehow one of them had convinced me to watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AtM3PGyiQUc">the trailer for Metal Gear Solid 5</a> and I watched them salivate with a sort of horror.  Really?  <em>Really?</em><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8rlbB9C4rJk/TwvDScY1OII/AAAAAAAAAl8/dZI4u-KteLQ/s1600/mgs5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="174" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8rlbB9C4rJk/TwvDScY1OII/AAAAAAAAAl8/dZI4u-KteLQ/s320/mgs5.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this silver-haired bishounen is holding up a freshly-extracted spinal column</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My head resonates with<i> </i>something that sounds disturbingly like <i>Kids these days!  </i>But I can&#8217;t let my heavy cynicism and bitter boredom with big-budget graphics-intensive gaming get in the way of talking about core design.  Which, though I only have about 9 hours to do it over the course of the next 9 weeks, I definitely want to do &#8211; and if at the end of it these people appreciate games not just for their diamond fluff, but <i>also </i>because they understand their design and creation, I&#8217;ll consider this experiment in facilitating a success.</div>

I tend to go on and off with photography in general (though associating my taking pictures with &#8220;photography&#8221; and its professional air still makes me wince), but I can tie my decrease in photo-taking activity to some specific things this time, namely:<br /><ol><li>The purse that I am currently using for everything, a shoulder-bag Haiku that&#8217;s lightweight and perfect for notebooks but bulges with a D40 in it;</li><li>My lack of personal computer with which to edit <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/raws-vs-jpeg-fine.html">raws</a>&nbsp;<raws>&#8211; my main computer broke after coming back from San Francisco, and I&#8217;ve been subsisting off Andou&#8217;s desktop and my work computer ever since.</raws></li></ol>As a result, I&#8217;ve been spending most of my time tinkering around with my iPod for photo-taking purposes. The picture quality, compared to my beloved 35mm lens, is obscene, but challenging. How do I get a good picture despite the gross noise and relative inability to get close to a subject?<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been cheating with <a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a><instagram>, which I initially despised as hipster filter city, but now enjoy, mainly because<br /><ol><li>I&#8217;m over the arguments of what constitutes &#8220;real&#8221; photography, and</li><li>&#8220;It&#8217;s just what it is &#8211; pictures from your phone.&#8221; Nothing more, nothing less. Thus was the revelation of <a href="http://www.nclrmrz.com/">Nicole</a><nicole>, my old roommate.</nicole></li></ol>The filters aren&#8217;t perfect (who would ever use Kelvin? I mean, really) and the faux tilt-shift filter can also look pretty fauxlty (ohoho). But I like my 24/7 shiba inu photo stream and the silent camaraderie of people liking your photos, somehow more earnest and without the nuance of self-interest on Tumblr. Plus, the constraints are a fun challenge.<div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lHIdZ8TQmJQ/Twe-DQv9bBI/AAAAAAAAAlc/tsmOcA24sGg/s1600/176997d4362711e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lHIdZ8TQmJQ/Twe-DQv9bBI/AAAAAAAAAlc/tsmOcA24sGg/s320/176997d4362711e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">how do i take a picture that will not suck?</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
