  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Ever since my old roommate Molly made butternut squash a couple years ago, I&#8217;ve really wanted to try making it myself. My first experience with it was like <i>whoa</i>. Who knew such decadence could some from such an unassuming squash?<br /><br />I found <a href="http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/detail.asp?docid=31244">a recipe from the online version of Cook&#8217;s Illustrated</a>&nbsp;to try out, since other recipes I found toss in tons of cream and recommend roasting the squash to dehydrate it and bring out its flavor, and I didn&#8217;t want to go through the extra effort and ingredients.&nbsp;What no one mentions, however, is that the most time-consuming part of cooking butternut squash soup is actually processing the squash in the first place. I tried three different knives to peel and cube this thing, each less sufficient than the last.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q435kdunnFQ/UI2gz-YbrdI/AAAAAAAACu8/EBkYIteOgnQ/s1600/butternut1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="380" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q435kdunnFQ/UI2gz-YbrdI/AAAAAAAACu8/EBkYIteOgnQ/s640/butternut1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">@_____@</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The next obstacle was my lack of a Dutch oven, which is what the recipe suggests you cook everything in. An internet search seemed to suggest that any old pot with some foil put over the top of it would suffice, so I tried that, but then came across Problem #2: my pot was way too small to fit all the squash and leeks, much less another four cups of vegetable broth. So, I decided to cook two halves of the soon-to-be-soup separately, except probably this pot was really not the best pot to use in the first place, because it became severely burnt.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fhks8KwDpiw/UI2g1EliJVI/AAAAAAAACvM/XUevdLW3rIU/s1600/butternut3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fhks8KwDpiw/UI2g1EliJVI/AAAAAAAACvM/XUevdLW3rIU/s640/butternut3.jpg" width="562" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i really doubt this is the &#8220;fond&#8221; that&#8217;s supposed to form at the pot&#8217;s bottom</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I moved to a shallower pan and that seemed to work.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eqJHjzzHAvA/UI2g1prxHEI/AAAAAAAACvU/Tr74gpu-aKU/s1600/butternut4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eqJHjzzHAvA/UI2g1prxHEI/AAAAAAAACvU/Tr74gpu-aKU/s640/butternut4.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">&#8230;maybe?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />By the time all of the squash had been boiled down, it still wasn&#8217;t quite&#8230;soupy.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5MAPtVEXTYQ/UI2g2U-TAHI/AAAAAAAACvc/b5e8R9SW08Q/s1600/butternut5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5MAPtVEXTYQ/UI2g2U-TAHI/AAAAAAAACvc/b5e8R9SW08Q/s640/butternut5.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">:C</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I thought I would be okay without a blender, but the soup at this stage was very fibrous and chunky and unappealing. Enter Problem #3: I have no food processor!<br /><br />Luckily the neighbors do, so we ran over there just to make use of their Vitamix.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QVtCSxR0fMc/UI2g2-VznJI/AAAAAAAACvk/l749c7wmNw4/s1600/butternut6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QVtCSxR0fMc/UI2g2-VznJI/AAAAAAAACvk/l749c7wmNw4/s640/butternut6.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">YES. IT LOOKS LIKE SOUP. YESSS</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Final touch: a swirl of sour cream, which sounded questionable but actually complemented the flavors very well.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jpH3ScABd-4/UI2g3UUSZ1I/AAAAAAAACvs/WihZfU0D9SY/s1600/butternut7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jpH3ScABd-4/UI2g3UUSZ1I/AAAAAAAACvs/WihZfU0D9SY/s640/butternut7.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">woo!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It was delicious! Hopefully I&#8217;ll have the chance to make this recipe again before the season&#8217;s out.</div>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xSI1kxNjyrE/UInbLHcxoNI/AAAAAAAACts/BUBOZJ90rx0/s1600/Wither_by_Lauren_DeStefano_cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xSI1kxNjyrE/UInbLHcxoNI/AAAAAAAACts/BUBOZJ90rx0/s320/Wither_by_Lauren_DeStefano_cover.jpg" width="213" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wither_(DeStefano_novel)">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was surprised to see so many scathing <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8525590-wither">reviews of Wither</a> on Goodreads, as I felt it (as a semi-romantic dystopian YA novel) would gather an inevitable flock of praise.<br /><br />[ spoilers ahead ]<br /><br />Firstly, I felt the writing itself did a good job of being both eerie and beautiful, which fit the atmosphere perfectly.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The bodice has big translucent butterfly wings in back that seem to be hemorrhaging glitter&#8230;</i></blockquote><br />I liked the characterization of the sister wives as well. Their personalities clash and contrast in a way that&#8217;s fun to read, and their personalities also reflect the basic &#8220;archetypes&#8221; of this future world: people who are excited to buy in (Cecily), people who want to fight the supposed inevitable (Rhine), and people who just want &#8220;a luxurious place to die&#8221; (Jenna). Each character has their their own talents and even&nbsp;<i>use</i>&nbsp;them for things relevant to character emotion/development, for example Cecily knocking out furious symphonies on the piano when Jenna dies.<br /><br />In contrast, none of the male characters are that interesting. Linden, the grieving and oblivious head of house, is predictable and boring in his fumbling and innocent adoration of Rhine. The dark secrets of his wives (that they were abducted for his pleasure, that Jenna&#8217;s sisters were murdered when Jenna was taken) are kept from him, and I wish that he <i>had</i>&nbsp;learned of them, just to stir things up.&nbsp;Gabriel, a servant who is Rhine&#8217;s secret (and inevitable) love interest, is kinda cute in his sneaking candy to Rhine beneath breakfast pancakes, but isn&#8217;t anything more than a blue-eyed guy who is described to like ships. Ordinarily I would appreciate that Gabriel liked <i>something</i>, but unlike the girls having a talent and executing on it, Gabriel does little to prove he likes boats other than talk about it sometimes. I guess I would better appreciate ships being really integral to him &#8211; not just something in the side &#8211; I wish he looked out hazy-eyed as if to an ocean, I wish when he made pancakes for Rhine he shaped them not like towers but like ships. When he told Rhine she was named after a river I wish he hadn&#8217;t learned randomly, but that he had seen it because he was looking at rivers, imagining how he would sail them.<br /><br />I won&#8217;t go into too much detail of the flawed plot and world-building since other reviews do that quite well already, in particular <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/117137212">this one</a>, which points out that hurricanes can&#8217;t happen in a world where there are no more continents except North America. It also notes that if the polar ice caps had really melted in Rhine&#8217;s world, then very little of Florida, the book&#8217;s main setting, would be above water. I personally don&#8217;t mind if books are not scientifically plausible &#8211; it&#8217;s fiction! &#8211; but it did grate on me when Rhine, the main character, started learning about Christopher Columbus.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>I educate myself on the polar ice caps, vaporized long ago by warfare, and an explorer named Christopher Columbus who proved the earth was round.</i></blockquote><br />I guess it just figures that the world would be completely destroyed but the myth of Columbus would still somehow be perpetuated above anything else that&#8217;s ever happened in thousands of years of human history. Also uncomfortable is the ethnocentrism of North America being the only continent &#8220;technologically advanced&#8221; enough to escape world war as anything other than a tiny landmass invisible from space. I mean, you know other countries have technology too, right? People from other countries even <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/year/">win Nobel Prizes</a>!<br /><br />It also figures that memories of Asian countries of the future would be condensed into exotic caricatures, that Japan is nothing more than cherry blossoms and geishas, and India is nothing more than saris and bindis that the characters emulate by pressing stickers on their foreheads. This <i>isn&#8217;t</i>&nbsp;cultural appreciation; it&#8217;s an erasure of the fact that Japanese and Indian people are more than just neat costumes you wish you had.</div>

I have to admit that I was <em>really</em> pessimistic about <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/10/things-sprouting-acidic-soil.html">those seeds</a>, but they have been growing well! I even found <a href="http://www.17apart.com/2012/01/how-to-plant-seeds-using-eggshells.html">someone growing seedlings in eggshells</a> and decided to try this out too, leaving out some swiss chard seeds in potting mix on the back steps and covering them with some plastic to emulate the humidity that I hear encourages plants to sprout. And they are sprouting!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dd_h0gIkF20/UInYtu72KvI/AAAAAAAACsc/yF-bDSsXYmo/s1600/eggchard.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dd_h0gIkF20/UInYtu72KvI/AAAAAAAACsc/yF-bDSsXYmo/s640/eggchard.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">little things~</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t very scientific about my observations, so I don&#8217;t know if they sprouted faster than the chard planted straight into the ground.

Your photos in this post are lovely and they blended in seamlessly with the Flickr blog posts that are also in my feed (as well as a photo-heavy blog about fostering kittens). I have a tiny epiphite like in the last photo there&#8230; except it has mysteriously disappeared from GRAIL! Oh no! </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
One of my favorite manga short stories, <i>Hotarubi no Mori e</i>&nbsp;by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Midorikawa">Yuki&nbsp;</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Midorikawa">Midorikawa</a>, was just made into an anime film! I&nbsp;cried after reading the story, and I cried after the&nbsp;animated film ended too. One would think that already&nbsp;knowing the ending would have removed the emotion from&nbsp;the film, but I guess not.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9xC2N3Su410/UIXweCUhwMI/AAAAAAAACq4/dbbR2tLSPQg/s1600/hotarubi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9xC2N3Su410/UIXweCUhwMI/AAAAAAAACq4/dbbR2tLSPQg/s400/hotarubi.jpg" width="282" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">tears everywhere, seriously (<a href="https://minniemeorange.wordpress.com/2012/03/04/anime-movie-review-hotarubi-no-mori-e/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />[spoilers ahead]<br /><br />I haven&#8217;t read much manga recently, but what stories&nbsp;I&#8217;ve read from Midorikawa still remain glowing in my&nbsp;memory. She always takes a single, strange premise &#8211; <a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=11498">a criminal investigator that can make people do as he says</a>, <a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=6781">a boy who inherits his grandmother&#8217;s &#8220;book of names&#8221; of spirits</a> &#8211; and uses story to cast light into the unique possibilities given by that premise, really stretches and shines it out to its full potential.<br /><i><br /></i><i>Hotarubi no&nbsp;</i><i>Mori e</i> in particular is my favorite of hers, because it&#8217;s so wonderfully concise, whole, and  focused. A human and a spirit meet and become friends, despite a peculiar limitation: if the spirit ever encounters human touch, he will vanish from the world.<br /><br />Significant events and points of growth in the characters&#8217; relationship revolve around the problem of contact. When the two first meet, they carry a stick between them to hold hands. One day, when the human falls from a tree, the spirit races to catch her &#8211; before pulling back at the last moment to let her crash. Afterward, she weeps &#8211; &#8220;Never touch me, ever!&#8221; &#8211; and those different facets of the premise sparkle to light. You understand it without the burden of over-narration; you understand simply, just as it happens. <i>He can&#8217;t protect her. He can&#8217;t even comfort her</i>. You watch her sob and sob and the spirit sits close by, face hidden by his mask.<br /><br />When people say that they just <i>had</i>&nbsp;to keep reading/watching/consuming because they want to see what will happen &#8211; this story really dazed me with that desperation. The conflict seems so <i>impossible</i>&nbsp;&#8211; you know what&#8217;s going to happen, what <i>must</i>&nbsp;happen &#8211; but does it? Is there any other way that this story could end?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and find out! :)</div>

By that point, each unnamed ‘brat’ has trained into one of three groups–Breeders, Builders, or Hunters, identifiable by the number of scars they bear on their arms. Deuce has wanted to be a Huntress for as long as she can remember.<br /><br />As a Huntress, her purpose is clear—to brave the dangerous tunnels outside the enclave and bring back meat to feed the group while evading ferocious monsters known as Freaks. She’s worked toward this goal her whole life, and nothing’s going to stop her, not even a beautiful, brooding Hunter named Fade. When the mysterious boy becomes her partner, Deuce’s troubles are just beginning.<br /><br />When she and Fade discover that the neighboring enclave has been destroyed by Freaks, who seem to be growing more organized, the elders refuse to listen to their warnings and exile Deuce and Fade. As t he two are guided out of the dead city by Fade&#8217;s long-ago memories, they face dangers, and feelings, unlike any they&#8217;ve ever known.</em></blockquote><br />I had to admit that I read Enclave just for something simple and easy to gnaw at&nbsp;between textbooks. It contains (what is inexplicably) my favorite male character&nbsp;stereotype, The Dark Loner with Mysterious/Potentially Tortured Past. What can I&nbsp;say? Some people chill out with chocolate or a reality TV show; I do it with the&nbsp;darkest, most tormented love interest I can find.<br /><br />Enclave was at first satisfying as far as &#8220;chill out&#8221; reading goes, but halfway through pivots, sheds or destroys almost all of the character relationships and world that it constructed, and goes running off haphazardly in a completely new and bewildering direction. The book, which had started in the underground ruins of New York, expels Deuce and Fade to the sunlit &#8220;Topside&#8221; at the drop of a hat, due to a conspiracy which had never before been mentioned but which Deuce suddenly realizes has been exposing itself in the form of innocents exiled to the &#8220;Topside&#8221; every once in a while.<br /><br />Deuce&#8217;s two best friends since childhood betray her, throwing away pages of friendship-building for no conceivable reason. A resistance to the enclave&#8217;s evil leadership, newly uncovered and heated in the ominous death of a well-beloved character, becomes irrelevant.<br /><br />Once on Topside, which turns out to be Fade&#8217;s original home, Fade motivates their progression northward, following a dream of better land that I have no idea why he didn&#8217;t follow before he was led underground. Deuce at some point is captured by Topside gangers, and meets Tegan, &#8220;liberally covered in bruises&#8221; and obviously lacking status amidst &#8220;the males&#8221; around her:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>She left my hands tied. </i>Smart girl. Well, relatively.<i style="font-style: italic;"> </i><i style="font-style: italic;">She couldn&#8217;t be too </i><i>smart if she took those bruises without complaining, but as I knew, you could used to anything.</i></blockquote><br />Wait, huh? How do you know she&#8217;s not complaining? Is she not smart because she&#8217;s being <i>abused?</i><br /><i><br /></i> Later, Tegan admits,<br /><br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost two cubs in the last year. The last time, I almost died. That was when I decided, if I ever got a chance to run, I&#8217;d take it. So I bided my time.&#8221;</i></blockquote><br />Okay, so Teagan has been likely made to have sex and children against her will, likely taken in a raid for &#8220;Breeders&#8221; by Stalker. Do you feel sympathy now, Deuce?<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Stalker shrugged, as though [Teagan&#8217;s] opinion didn&#8217;t matter to him. I understood, I thought. He could respect Fade and me because we&#8217;d fought. Because she hadn&#8217;t, Tegan might never gain full value in his eyes.</i></blockquote><i><br /></i><i>No. I cannot even marginally respect that Deuce can &#8220;understand&#8221; why Tegan may not have &#8220;full value.&#8221;</i>&nbsp;Depicting a possible rape victim as a weakling who isn&#8217;t respected because she didn&#8217;t&nbsp;<em>fight until she died</em>&nbsp;is not okay, not even in a fictional universe, because no universe born from a mind raised in this one is free from the influences of a society where rape is still something people joke about, trivialize, and often blame on the survivor.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t think the problematic elements of this story could get any more ridiculous until the character that had held Tegan captive, the aforementioned Stalker, became a love interest. Though Tegan is considered to be a friend by Deuce, there&#8217;s still a sense that Stalker, the abuser, is more easily forgiven and respected than Tegan, the abused. How can this be even partially attractive?<br /><br />In the end, I can&#8217;t appreciate a book that takes heavy concepts like patriarchy and sexual abuse and, rather than examining them critically, only perpetuates them.</div>

Escape from slaver&nbsp;Darwin West and his cruel Overseers. Escape from the backbreaking work of&nbsp;gathering Water. Escape from living as if it is still 1812, the year they were&nbsp;all enslaved.<br /><br />When Ruby meets Ford—an irresistible, kind, forbidden new Overseer—she longs to&nbsp;run away with him to the modern world where she could live a normal teenage&nbsp;life. Escape with Ford would be so simple.<br /><br />But if Ruby leaves, her community is condemned to certain death. She, alone,&nbsp;possesses the secret ingredient that makes the Water so special — her blood —&nbsp;and it’s the one thing that the Congregation cannot live without.<br /><br />Drought is the haunting story of one community’s thirst for life, and the&nbsp;dangerous struggle of the only girl who can grant it.</em></blockquote><br />Drought was okay. Ultimately I felt the really compelling ideas in the story &#8211;&nbsp;the life-giving blood, the 200-year-old-plus members of the capital-C Congregation &#8211; were never&nbsp;given enough room to become really magical. Though she struggles with how to&nbsp;lead and sustain her community, the 200-year-old Ruby doesn&#8217;t act or think like&nbsp;anything other than a suppressed teenager from any other YA novel. Does 200 years&nbsp;mean so little?<br /><br />Ruby&#8217;s blood has the power to heal wounds and grant&nbsp;longevity&nbsp;to its drinkers,&nbsp;because she is the daughter of a man, Otto, who had the same. Ruby sneaks her blood into the Congregation&#8217;s life-giving Water, which she and her Congregation gather under the chain whips of Darwin West. No one knows that the only active ingredient in Water is Ruby&#8217;s blood. At some point in the past Otto left for some reason, and the Congregation&nbsp;and Ruby spend the entire novel praising and waiting for Otto to deliver&nbsp;them from their slavery. Spoilers: he does not. From whence did Otto come, to&nbsp;where did he go? Why does he have magical blood? Spoilers: you never learn.<br /><br />That you never learn who Otto is or why he and Ruby have magical blood feels unfair. The mystery and suspense of the entire book deflates anti-climatically with Ruby&nbsp;and Ford fleeing out to live their presumably superhuman-long lives&nbsp;together, since it&#8217;s hinted that Ford, engorged with Ruby-blooded Water, might&nbsp;just match Ruby lifespan-wise. Even this might have been satisfying if Ruby had&nbsp;spared some thought to the effect of &#8220;I don&#8217;t know who Otto is and I don&#8217;t care,&nbsp;because I am done hinging my life on a person who hasn&#8217;t existed in it since I&nbsp;was born 200 years ago.&#8221;<br /><br />Ruby and Ford&#8217;s romance was also a shrug for me, a love-at-first-sight that never grows into any deeper chemistry. They have a simple growing lust for one another, and Ford makes promises to Ruby that he&#8217;ll give her everything she wants, which at first iteration involves popcorn and warm spaghetti. Ford plays a blue-eyed teenager who pulls on an Overseer&#8217;s tormentor mask so as to earn health insurance for his mother, who is apparently dying of cancer. Can Ruby&#8217;s magical blood cure Ford&#8217;s mother? Spoilers: this isn&#8217;t something discussed in the novel, though I really wish it was. Imagine if the conflict in this book involved Ruby considering giving Ford her blood, torn between wanting to keep her healing blood a secret and wanting to help Ford, torn between wanting him happy and wanting him to stay even if his mother were well&#8230;something like this might have more tightly bound the themes of &#8220;healing blood&#8221; and &#8220;young/first love,&#8221; maybe, shrug.<br /><br />One thing that I really loved about this book were its antagonists, which at first numbered Darwin, head exploiter of the Congregation, whose whip comes out at the least provocation and results in the frequent bloody beating of Ruby&#8217;s mother. Darwin comes up with a variety of ways to torture the Congregation, each more frustrating to read about than the last. Ruby&#8217;s mother is the other antagonist, at first a supportive figure whose unending mantra to &#8221;<em>sustain</em>&#8221; the Congregation, rather than break free, becomes absolutely infuriating after a while (in a good, &#8220;This character is making me have feelings! Whoa, look at the conflict!&#8221; way).</div>

Blueberry plant also got some peat moss to keep it healthy, since the pH tester registered a perfect neutral for the soil that it was in.<br /><br />I also discovered a lime tree on sale at the grocery store, and placed it to live near the indoor herbs currently hanging out on the dryer. The herbs are a thai basil and a stevia, both gifted to me from a &#8220;free&#8221; bin at the farmer&#8217;s market. I&#8217;m not really sure what I&#8217;ll do with either of them yet, particularly since I think the thai basil is about to flower and die soon.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L_zeF7hF-uM/UHIIWJIsM_I/AAAAAAAACnE/EhMxMb8bS8s/s1600/limetreestevia.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="446" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L_zeF7hF-uM/UHIIWJIsM_I/AAAAAAAACnE/EhMxMb8bS8s/s640/limetreestevia.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">indoor homies</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The stevia is getting pretty tall so I may try and <a href="http://www.stevia.com/Stevia_article/Growing_Your_Own_Stevia/8077">cut it back as suggested</a>, though my inner novice worries that an entire plant might just go belly up after being nipped.</div>
