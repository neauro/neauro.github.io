The exception is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/dragon-flight/id530610467?mt=8">Dragon Flight</a> by Next Floor, a simple dragon-themed shooter. Long story short: put your finger over the character, swipe left and right to eliminate rows of evil/cute monsters, collect the coins and jewels upon expelled upon monsters&#8217; expiration.<br /><br />Coins gathered mid-fray can be used to purchase increasingly expensive upgrades, which make your bullets cooler-looking and faster at killing things, which is nice. The system is clean-cut: farm dragons, upgrade to farm dragons better, farm more dragons. In the background is a high score based on how many meters you were able to cross before dying, which provides a pretty sensible long-term goal in each individual, short game. There are also power-ups you can collect mid-fray (&#8220;shoot twice as many bullets;&#8221; &#8220;become invincible and shoot forward for two seconds or so;&#8221; etc.) which mix things up a little.<br /><br />About the only bewildering thing to me is the other score system, which allots you points based on the types of dragons you killed, white dragons yielding like 100 points and tougher, yellow ones yielding 500 (or something). And sometimes when you kill a dragon a &#8220;2x&#8221; or &#8220;3x&#8221; or something pops up overhead? I&#8217;m still not sure what this means, though presumably it rewards the player for going on streaks of killing only a certain color of dragon, which is difficult to plan out when rows of randomly-arranged dragons appear and rush away in the space of seconds. I&#8217;ve been musing about what purpose having both a score based on &#8220;This is how far you went!&#8221; and a &#8220;This is how many points you won!&#8221; score might serve. For example, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris#Scoring">Tetris</a>,&nbsp;clearing lines as soon as possible help you stay in the game longer (and keeps your stress level low), whereas making a &#8220;tetris&#8221; or clearing four lines at once rewards more points.<br /><br />Anyway, I haven&#8217;t found my answer yet, but it may be because all I care about is farming dragons (<i>give me that 8000 coin dragon egg dammit omg</i>).<br /><br />Other slightly annoying thing: placing your finger directly over the player-character to navigate her obstructs her from view, which means it can be hard to catch falling treasure. Because the screen reads movement no matter where your finger is, I experimented with navigating the player-character while holding my finger near the top of the screen, but then I couldn&#8217;t see where I was shooting. I haven&#8217;t thought of any possible alternatives yet for this, other than tilt-based controlling, which seems like it would be too slow for twitchy treasure-catching.<br /><br />Anyway~ Dragon Flight is a simple and satisfying time-waster, but I can&#8217;t wait until I can replace it with gardening and Return to Ravnica :D</div>

Now award-winning author Mark Kurlansky tells the remarkable story of New York by following the trajectory of one of its most fascinating inhabitants &#8211; the oyster, whose influence on the great metropolis remains unparalleled.<br /><br />For centuries New York was famous for its oysters, which until the early 1900s played such a dominant role in the city&#8217;s economy, gastronomy, and ecology that the abundant bivalves were Gotham&#8217;s most celebrated export, a staple food for the wealthy, the poor, and tourists alike, and the primary natural defense against pollution for the city&#8217;s congested waterways.<br /><br />Filled with cultural, historical, and culinary insight &#8211; along with historic recipes, maps, drawings, and photos &#8211; this dynamic narrative sweeps readers from the island hunting ground of the Lenape Indians to the death of the oyster beds at the rise of America&#8217;s environmentalist movement, from the oyster cellars of the rough-and-tumble Five Points slums to Manhattan&#8217;s poshest Gilded Age dining chambers.</i></blockquote><br />Reading history in general is a lot more palatable to me when it anchors itself on a single thing, especially if that thing is a food item (haha?). As such, I picked up&nbsp;<i>The Big Oyster:</i>&nbsp;a history of New York that revolves around a bivalve that apparently was once so populous there that people were like, &#8220;Oh, well, if poor people can&#8217;t afford to buy food, at least they can just dredge up oysters to eat!&#8221;<br /><br />It&#8217;s a book that made me wince at every page with the sheer amount of environmental pollution that people are willing to inflict on their environments, especially when the feedback of such destructive actions isn&#8217;t clear enough (like if all your sewage sinks into the bay, below sight&#8230;and right on the oyster beds). Consider &#8220;the Collect:&#8221;<br /><br /><blockquote><i>This pond where the Lenape [Native Americans] once fished, where the Dutch picnicked on an adjacent hill to have a view of it, was becoming a mucky, malarial swamp, strewn with trash and festering with disease.</i></blockquote><br />Or the quality of water in Manhattan:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Also, the city was running out of fresh water. The drinking water came from local wells that caught the rainwater that washed down the foul streets. By midcentury, the quality of Manhattan water had become so bad that out-of-town horses refused to drink it.</i></blockquote><br />Or what happened after the American Revolution:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Discarded trash would start to fill in around the piers and merchants, rather than cleaning it out, would extend the docks farther out and finish filling in the trash area with landfill until they had added several blocks to lower Manhattan at the expense of the East River, the harbor, and the Hudson.</i></blockquote><br />AAAAHHHH ;____;<br /><br />Something else that I appreciated about the book was that it didn&#8217;t stick strictly to the history of white settlers to New York, but also discussed the activities of people of color.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The first black in Manhattan was an explorer named Jan Rodrigues who came on a Dutch ship in 1613 [&#8230;] By the 1630s, a free black community had been established north of the pond. By 1750, Manhattan was 18 percent black, comparable to today&#8217;s ratio.</i></blockquote><br />And, did you know about Thomas Downing, who owned the Downing&#8217;s restaurant from 1830 to 1860, New York&#8217;s &#8220;most celebrated oyster cellar,&#8221; which catered Charles Dickens&#8217; visit to the United States? Downing also sent oysters to Queen Victoria, which she repaid by giving him a gold watch. Pretty cooool.<br /><br />There&#8217;s also notes made of women; here&#8217;s one concerning the opening of the Delmonica cafe, around 1824:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>For Americans, the initial curiosity of was the first female cashier they had ever seen, a new concept, entrusting women with money.</i></blockquote><br />That&#8217;s less than <i>200 years ago</i>. Also happening around this time: not women, but men doing grocery shopping and bringing the bags home. Because, as one man put it, &#8220;The man who was ashamed to carry home his dinner didn&#8217;t deserve any.&#8221; (Also, I guess men could more easily wade through the filth of the marketplaces, as they are socialized to wear trousers rather than long dresses. See how sexism hurts everybody?)<br /><br />There are, of course, a fair share of interesting oyster tidbits:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Producers discovered that oysters are educable. The grower would choose plump, large oysters and replant them closer to shore where they would be exposed for a few hours a day in low tide. After a few days, they would move the oysters a little farther up so that they were exposed for a few minutes longer in low tides. [&#8230;] The oysters learned to take a long hard drink before the water retreated and eventually would hold the water the entire time they were exposed.</i></blockquote>In conclusion: fun, easy to read, informative, inclusive.</div>

But beauty comes with a hidden price tag. Is Sara willing to pay?</i></blockquote><br />I was happy to rediscover Sara&#8217;s Face in one of my tubs of books in the garage. It&#8217;s a book that I scavenged from some many hundreds expelled from the city library, and I decided it was mine after I read the words <i>face transplant</i>.<br /><br />The book is written as if by a novelist playing the role of a journalist. He or she dissects the grosteque and still-mysterious events surrounding Jonathan Heat, an aging rockstar invested in his looks, and Sara Carter, a 17-year-old girl who wants to become famous, in a Manic-Pixie-Dream-Girl sort of way. <br /><br /><blockquote><i>It&#8217;s like, when people look at you and think, </i>Oh, she&#8217;s smaller than in real life,<i> because, see, actually, you&#8217;re not real life. It&#8217;s when people start talking to you in the street or on the bus because they think they know you, but they never even met you, or like you&#8217;ve got some secret they want to know but they never can. Like you&#8217;re a blessing. There&#8217;s something about you that inspires them to be more than themselves. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s what I want to be. Just like that.</i></blockquote><br />The book is written as if the event&#8217;s conclusion has already been well-disseminated amongst its fictional UK populace, and in some ways, you as the reader can have some very well-founded suspicions of What Happens at the End as well. Does that mean that the book isn&#8217;t exciting? I once read a blog post about writing (which I can&#8217;t find at the moment) which stated that, No, just knowing the ending isn&#8217;t enough to spoil the story; and in fact, sometimes knowing it full-out keeps you crawling toward it like a desperate person. &#8220;Have you ever heard of the time that I got shot?&#8221; Person X might say, and upon you replying, <i>No! Tell me about it,</i> Person X might answer, &#8220;Well, I wasn&#8217;t actually shot, but I certainly got you interested.&#8221;<br /><br />So &#8211; you kinda sorta maybe know what&#8217;s going to happen &#8211; kinda sorta? Maybe? Even so, I was engrossed in the proceedings as if they were happening &#8220;now,&#8221; as if the characters recounting their actions still had no idea what was going to happen. Every character offered in the story is meaningful, and full of motivation, action, and regret. The writing is easy to digest, straightforward, and full of punch. It takes only a couple sentences to understand who a character is.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>I need new tits. I need a whole new body, actually. I tell you, I get fatter when I&#8217;m dieting. I get fat just by breathing. I can turn air into fat. It&#8217;s a gift I have.</i></blockquote><br />Though the book is supposed to have been written by &#8220;a journalist,&#8221; occasionally things are portrayed with novelist-like omniscience:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>There was another huge bang, a bellow as if the Minotaur himself was coming, and then a man&#8217;s voice speaking out urgently but low, the words too blurred to make out. Then, there came the sound of a girl suddenly screaming in pain. It was truly dreadful, a cawing, screeching noise that [Sara] understood was coming from a pretty young throat.</i></blockquote><br />In this scene, only Sara is able to hear the screaming, and Sara hasn&#8217;t told her story to the journalist yet at this point; so why does the journalist detail it? For me, these small strangenesses were only very small bumps in the road; overall the book kept me ravenous to learn What Happens Next, and it was only grudgingly that I put it away to get some sleep, only to pick it up again at 6am to finish it.</div>

<br />Now that I&#8217;m moving into a place with a yard (!!), I&#8217;ve been eagerly making lists of easy and functional plants to attempt raising, such as rosemary, lavender, and mint. But then I saw blueberry plants at the farmer&#8217;s market! And I remembered that a blueberry bush subsists in my childhood home, which means it&#8217;s grown and borne fruit despite being under the care of a family with only a mildly green (like let&#8217;s say <span style="color: #78ab46;">#78AB46</span>) thumb.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-afLO_FHRiSE/UEUCkMAIZ-I/AAAAAAAACXg/aG6dEvq1rhs/s1600/blueberry.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-afLO_FHRiSE/UEUCkMAIZ-I/AAAAAAAACXg/aG6dEvq1rhs/s640/blueberry.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">blueberryyyy</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This is what I&#8217;ve learned thus far about blueberry plant care from the farmer who sold me the plant, as well as a variety of internet sources:<br /><ol><li>Fertilizer meant for azaleas and rhododendrons is best for blueberries, presumably because it is acidic, and acidity is what blueberries like. Also good: peat moss.</li><li>No chicken manure! (&#8220;It&#8217;s too sweet for them.&#8221;)</li><li>Blueberries like their soil kept moist, and like at least 1&#8221; of water a week. Water is important for fruit growth.</li><li>They prefer 6-8 hours of sun.</li><li>Pruning is recommended in winter, for good air circulation and generally healthy plant growth.</li><li>When pruning, don&#8217;t let branches crisscross; this helps the plant get good air circulation.</li><li>The particular breed I bought (&#8220;Jersey northern highbush&#8221;) yields blueberries late in the year (as in, around now, instead of July through August.)</li><li>The particular variety I got is also self-pollinating, but also appreciates bees visiting from other blueberry plants.</li><li>Blueberries can propagate from cuttings! Not sure if I&#8217;ll try this out immediately, though.</li></ol><div>Something else I&#8217;ve learned, unspecific to blueberries, is that I should really research plant care before purchase. The blueberry plant I bought has a lot of crisscrossing branches already, and some branches that droop so low they touch the ground&#8230;I&#8217;m sure I could have picked a better one if I knew what to look for.</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
When A and I <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/07/a-guide-to-some-touristy-things-of-oahu.html">visited Hawaii last month</a>, we had arranged for SpeediShuttle to pick us up on the 7th of July. We waited until about an hour before our flight before we quit calling their unresponsive hotline for reasons why they hadn&#8217;t shown up yet, and called a taxi instead.<br /><br />Well, last weekend we finally heard back from them &#8211; more than seven weeks after we arranged from them to pick us up. It turns out that someone had taken in our information and mis-typed it, somehow taking our request for a July 7th pick-up and noting it as&nbsp;<i>Pick these people up on August 30th.</i><br /><i><br /></i>Though it was a stressful situation at the time, to be honest, after seven weeks it&#8217;s hard to grasp at even a semblance of bitterness. Mistakes happen. Even so, the SpeediShuttle people we spoke to were very kind and offered us a refund, which was great! :) That at least pays for (most of) the taxi fare, haha.<br /><br />To be honest, the thing I&#8217;m most curious about now is how the mistake was made. No matter how I look at the keypad, it seems far-fetched to mis-type <i>8/30</i>&nbsp;instead of <i>7/7</i>&#8230;was the person who made the appointment maybe using an HTML-style form with drop-downs&#8230;even on drop-downs, &#8220;30&#8221; is pretty far from &#8220;7&#8221;&#8230;I mean, if someone&#8217;s just inputting data into a computer, then maybe you could just have users fill in the data themselves, right? Rather than calling a human being to input pickup data for them, and then have no confirmation that the input data was correct?<br /><br />Furthermore, the fact that someone may miss their flight out when their system fails is a pretty serious consequence, one that may warrant at least one person manning their hotline at all times. Or if the hotline could at least take messages when no one&#8217;s there?<br /><br />Shrug.</div>

For example, the following is wrong:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: html"><script src="game.js"></script> <!-- "WHERE IS #CANVAS" --><br /><canvas id="canvas"></canvas><br /></pre><br />In trying to do collision stuff, I also ran into a curious problem where the following did not work:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">if ( ((that.X-that.radius) &lt;= (player.X+player.width)) &amp;&amp;<br />(that.Y &gt;= player.Y) &amp;&amp;<br />(that.Y &lt; (player.y+player.height)))<br />collided = PADDLE;<br /></pre><br />But this <em>did</em>:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">var hit_paddle_side = beneath_paddle_top = above_paddle_bottom = false;<br /><br />if (((that.X-that.radius) &lt;= (player.X+player.width))) hit_paddle_side = true;                 if ((that.Y &gt;= player.Y)) beneath_paddle_top = true;<br />if ((that.Y &lt; (player.Y+player.height))) above_paddle_bottom = true;<br /><br />if (hit_paddle_side &amp;&amp; beneath_paddle_top &amp;&amp; above_paddle_bottom)<br />    collided = PADDLE;<br /></pre><br />Not sure why yet.<br /><br />All the code is <a href="https://github.com/neauro/html5pong">on my Github</a> for now.</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6uhzfNkxVpA/UDJowEbNE1I/AAAAAAAACRE/Lzzro_g4iDs/s1600/DSC_0001_08172012.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6uhzfNkxVpA/UDJowEbNE1I/AAAAAAAACRE/Lzzro_g4iDs/s640/DSC_0001_08172012.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />The other day HC came over and we decided to make cupcakes. Given my limited store of ingredients, we went with cheesecake, that being the type of cupcake that requires little investment in terms of icing and ingredients that I didn&#8217;t posses.<br /><br />The recipe is sourced from what I now realize is <a href="http://www.kraftrecipes.com/recipes/paula-deens-easy-cheesecake-120241.aspx">Kraft&#8217;s Recipes</a>. We changed the butter extract to vanilla extract. The recipe is for 12 cupcakes, but we ended up making around 18. Also, we ended up not putting any jam or anything on the cupcakes, but they were quite sweet on their own.<br /><br /><b>Ingredients</b><br /><ol><li>2 pkg. (8 oz. each) cream cheese, softened</li><li>1 cup granulated sugar</li><li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li><li>2 &nbsp;eggs</li><li>12 vanilla wafers</li><li>1 cup seedless raspberry jam</li><li>1pt. fresh raspberries</li><li>2 tbsp. powdered sugar for dusting</li></ol><div><br /></div><div><b>Instructions</b></div><div><div><ol><li>Place a paper cupcake liner in each of 18 muffin cups.</li><li>Beat cream cheese until fluffy. Add granulated sugar and butter extract, beating well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li><li>Place a vanilla wafer, flat-side down, in each muffin cup. Spoon cream cheese mixture over wafers, until paper lining is about 3/4ths filled. Bake for 20 minutes.</li><li>Allow tarts to cool completely. When cool, top each cheesecake cupcake with 1/2 Tbsp. of raspberry jam and fresh raspberries. Dust with powdered sugar.</li></ol><br />Since the vanilla wafers we bought were a little too small for the paper liner, we experimented with making half the liners filled with whole wafers, and half with crushed. (By the way &#8211; vanilla wafers are easily crushed by placing them inside a glass mixing bowl, and mashing them with the flat bottom of another glass.)</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Unu9_hZ3afA/UDJpVbnjmSI/AAAAAAAACRQ/6U1WFs44JZ8/s1600/DSC_0002%2B%25282%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Unu9_hZ3afA/UDJpVbnjmSI/AAAAAAAACRQ/6U1WFs44JZ8/s640/DSC_0002%2B%25282%2529.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />In the end, the crushed wafers ended up quite crumbly, so whole wafers really are probably the way to go.</div></div>
