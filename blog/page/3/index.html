<p><em>Thomas Was Alone</em> was super cute, if more ambiguous than I personally like. I liked the personality given to all the different shapes, though their common heroism and conceit got a little old as the game went on, which was why Laura&rsquo;s cynicism made her my favorite (though I felt compelled inexlicably to keep calling her &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo;). I loved that the levels were tilted, the play of light, the strange colors. (Though I wonder if any colorblind users had a hard time playing?)</p>

<p>One thing I think the game could have been improved was the game&rsquo;s sense of progression; though numbers ticked up each level, after a while they became meaningless, and now that the game is finished I&rsquo;m not totally sure what I would use them for. The introduction of each of the colored shapes, Thomas&rsquo;s &ldquo;death,&rdquo; and the era of the gray shapes seemed to be the largest movements in the story, and though each was accompanied with a fun snippet of &ldquo;The AIs are gaining sentience!&rdquo; flavor I didn&rsquo;t really have a sense that things were reaching their end until the end came suddenly to meet me. Some levels seemed like little &ldquo;drabbles&rdquo; and experiments, which I completed without much more effort than would take for me to click a cow in Farmville, and it would have been cool to see something else related to AIs breaking their previous ways of being. Breaking through the borders of levels — intentionally disobeying orders — something to add to the flavor text.</p>

<p>I played <em>Thomas Was Alone</em> on a projector and if you have the opportunity to do so yourself I recommend it. All those rectangles are like way better when they&rsquo;re as big as your face.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been putting off getting a virtual machine running on the Mac computer I use for work, mostly because I wanted to forget the existence of &lt;IE9 browsers entirely. Unfortunately, the visual bugs accumulating across my projects were starting to get a little ridiculous.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/proleft.png" alt="Screenshot of IE8 errors"/></p>

<p class="caption">omg why</p>


<p>After some hours of searching and fiddling, I discovered my favorite solution for running IE on a Mac. It goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the relevant/recent version of Oracle&#8217;s <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>.</li>
<li>Use the Terminal and and run <code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | env IEVMS_VERSIONS="8 9" bash</code> to download 2 virtual machines; one that can run IE8, and one that can run IE9.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s it! Once that&rsquo;s finished, you can open VirtualBox and you&rsquo;ll see your boxes all ready to go.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/virtualbox.png" alt="Screenshot of IE8 in VirtualBox"/></p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/09/04/internet-explorer-for-mac-ie7-ie8-ie-9-free/">OSXDaily</a> for the post that led me to finding <a href="https://github.com/xdissent">xdissent</a>&rsquo;s awesome installations.</p>

<p>Other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>border-radius</code>, <code>rem</code>, and <code>opacity</code> are some of the many words not recognized by IE8.</li>
<li>PressF12 to open up IE8&#8217;s Developer Tools.</li>

<p>For whatever reason, <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> is becoming my social media site of choice, probably because its humor appeals to me so much. I also love that it supports people easily creating blogs that cater to specific topics &mdash; like <a href="http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/">people of color in medieval art</a>, or <a href="http://moviecode.tumblr.com/">source code in TV and films</a>, or <a href="http://tabcloseddidntread.com/">intrusive pop-ups</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve made my own tumblr for gathering examples of <a href="http//delightful-ux.tumblr.com">delightful user experience</a>, which is my main interest when it comes to the wide world of human-centered design. Even though I love it, I&rsquo;m still muddy on what comprises a delightful user experience, and thus far have tossed in examples of <a href="http://adobe.breach.il.ly/#/about">useful websites with friendly wording</a>, as well as <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/post/71660750263/hells-pizza-coffin-box-new-zealand-based-hell">pizza box designs with unnecessary but awesome utility</A>, and <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/post/71681828062/australian-sharks-send-tweets-to-warn-swimmers">sharks with Twitter accounts</a>.</p>

<p>For now, when deciding whether to add an example, I ask myself, &ldquo;Could this Thing accomplish what it currently accomplishes, but in a more boring way?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Does this Thing solve for an action that is not-that-fun to do?&rdquo; And if the answer to either is &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; — lo, thusly do I deem it delightful.</p>

<p>I understand that second question might still catch Things that are not entirely playful — but I&rsquo;m not going to stress out about differentiating between design that&rsquo;s good and design that fulfills some nebulously defined good feel.</p>

<p>If you have encountered a good feel recently yourself, feel free to <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/submit">submit</a>!</p>

<p>After NaNoWriMo finished, my pastime of choice during my commute became playing through <em>Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies</em>.</p>

<p>[ spoilers ahead ]</p>

<p>Athena was a cool protagonist, though scenes where she was relegated to &ldquo;cyncial dude&rsquo;s naive, enthusiastic female sidekick&rdquo; were yawny. (Come on! Maya and Trucy are already these characters, we don&rsquo;t need more of them.) Ultimately it&rsquo;s nice to see that Athena has her own reasons for entering the attourneyforce, and though they were man-centered they were also totally platonic, which was nice. Athena&rsquo;s devoting to &ldquo;saving&rdquo; Blackquill also mirrored her desire to save her best friend, Juniper Woods, which meant her dramatic, heroic tendencies at least were in character.</p>

<p>Mostly I was happy to see old characters again, even Apollo Justice, who I disliked before but liked in <em>Dual Destinies</em>, probably because he was now a familiar face, haha. What I wanted most out of this game was to see Maya again, but I guess a note from her will do in lieu of <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>I also liked <em>Dual Destinies</em>&lsquo; execution of &ldquo;telling the end at the beginning.&rdquo; One of my favorite parts was realizing that Apollo had had an eyepatch over his eye even <em>before the courtroom explosion</em> — it was a fun/cute manipulation of the audience&rsquo;s assumptions that that particular bandage was just part of his injuries.</p>

<p>Good examples of &ldquo;the end at the beginning&rdquo; does <em>not</em>, however, include all the times that the game felt obliged to either tell you who the antagonist was, or make it clearly obvious, and PWDD&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&comic=123013">serious case of the hand-holdies</a>&rdquo; led to me to really only loving the game&rsquo;s final case, and feeling shruggy about the others. It would have been nice if each case had contributed more to each character&rsquo;s development as well; &ldquo;Ninetails Vale&rdquo; in particular didn&rsquo;t feel tied to anything in the larger story, and as a standalone wasn&rsquo;t terribly interesting to me either.</p>

<p>Documentaries are my whitenoise of choice. Due to studying, I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot more of them on Netflix.</p>

<p>More recently, I&rsquo;ve two documentaries about orcas: <em>Killer Whales</em> by the Discovery Channel, about the behavior of killer whales in the wild; and <em>Blackfish</em>, about orcas held in captivity. They&rsquo;re both pretty incredible; I&rsquo;m shocked at how much footage there is of killer whales doing things, whether it&rsquo;s hunting poisonous sting rays in New Zealand or yanking human beings into pools by their ankles.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hilarious to watch the footage of killer whales hunting seals in the first documentary, with a voiceover of a man marveling at their intelligence; and to watch this footage again in the second, where the background noise is preserved, and a woman is panicking, &ldquo;Oh no! Oh no! <em>On noooo</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Blackfish</em> also connected nicely with the last essay in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Science-Nature-Writing/dp/0547350635">The Best American Science and Nature Writing (2011)</a>, though the writer states there that one of the orca trainers was pulled by her hair into the water, whereas trainers in the <em>Blackfish</em> movie argue that this is a lie, another way to &ldquo;blame the victim&rdquo; of the orca attack, rather than the orca itself and the poor treatment that drove it to &ldquo;psychopathy.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/frozen-poster.jpg" alt="Frozen poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=109012">via</a>)</p>


<p>A and I went to see <em>Frozen</em>, a movie I had very little interest in seeing until I realized Idina Menzel was voicing a main character. There&rsquo;s been a lot said already for the lack of diversity amongst the characters (regarding both <a href="">race</a>, as well as <a href="http://sapphicdalliances.tumblr.com/post/68881922280">the representation of women</a>) and my disappointment about these issues in <em>Frozen</em> has exhausted me utterly. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it. Instead, I want to note aspects of the overall story that A and I discussed after the movie.</p>

<p>[ spoilers ahead ]</p>

<h2><em>Frozen</em> is about Elsa and Anna</h2>

<p>This is great. From the trailers, there was almost no indication that the story&rsquo;s main conflict involved the relationship between two women. Anna struggles somewhat with the men in the story, and though she desires &ldquo;true love&rdquo; at its beginning, lovers never usurp her existing relationship with her sister. At the end, Anna even plays the main role in saving both Elsa and herself, through the power of ~<em>True Love</em>~! Hurray!</p>

<h2>But what does <em>Frozen</em> do with &ldquo;True Love&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>&ldquo;True Love&rdquo; seems to be Frozen&rsquo;s main theme. Elsa&rsquo;s version of True Love is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t harm those who you love,&rdquo; and requires her to isolate herself as a precaution to harming her sister; the fact that doing so makes both her and Anna unhappy are not as important as Anna&rsquo;s safety. At the end of the movie, Elsa realizes (somewhat abruptly) that her version of True Love is flawed, presumably because it&rsquo;s more about fearing herself, rather than loving someone else. (…right? This actually happened so suddenly that I&rsquo;m just going to believe that this is the case.)</p>

<p>In contrast, Anna&rsquo;s version of true love — which could be described as &ldquo;Always believe in someone that you love&rdquo; — has absolutely no fear involved. Despite everyone&rsquo;s warnings and panic, Anna continues to believe the best of Elsa, even when Elsa actually <em>does</em> harm her.</p>

<p>I like how Elsa and Anna&rsquo;s interpretations of love clash in this movie, but one thing I don&rsquo;t like is that, though Elsa&rsquo;s view of love evolves by the end of the movie, Anna&rsquo;s view remains static. From the beginning Anna is the same &ldquo;open to loving people!&rdquo; character that she&rsquo;s shown to be from the beginning, despite events that show people can harm her: Elsa ostracizes her, Love Interest #1 (Hans) betrays her. That these events don&rsquo;t change her outlook on life feels like a waste; rather than actively choosing to love people, for Anna it&rsquo;s just a given, and this takes away from her complexity and agency as a character.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that the events of the movie are put into motion by Elsa&rsquo;s fear that she might kill Anna, and by the end of the movie, it&rsquo;s revealed that there was no way that Elsa could have ever killed Anna at all. The entire time, Anna had a magical understanding of &ldquo;True Love&rdquo; that could have <em>always</em> saved her from Elsa&rsquo;s power, which makes the entire plot somewhat of a non-issue.</p>

<h2>And what did the other characters do?</h2>

<p>Given that the movie&rsquo;s main conflict is Elsa and Anna&rsquo;s relationship, and true love, the other major characters — Kristoff, Olaf, and Hans — all felt thrown in. I would have loved to see them all focused to serve the &ldquo;true love&rdquo; theme by addressing love in different ways. Treated differently, Kristoff could have been a great catalyst for Anna&rsquo;s development of her version of love. I&rsquo;m inagining him, a character distrusting of other humans, teaching her about the horrible things humans do; she fights it (&ldquo;No way, humans are inherently Lawful Good!&rdquo;); Kristoff then points out that her sister is laying waste to their kingdom and also has been pretty mean in general to people; Anna cracks a bit; and then, right on cue, Anna is betrayed again by Hans.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/anna.jpg" alt="Frozen poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">omg will she now become totally jaded? or will she still choose looove? (<A href="http://turntherightcorner.com/2013/09/27/movie-trailer-for-disneys-frozen/disneys-frozen-2013-screenshot-princess-anna/">via</a>)</p>


<p>Kristoff&rsquo;s dislike of humans is played up without explanation of how it came to be, as if he had simply dropped out of the sky as a perfectly-formed gruff male love interest. I would have loved to see more time spent on him and his relationship with Sven and the snow trolls, rather than other seemingly extraneous details of his character. For example, why is it important that Kristoff is an ice merchant, and what was the point of the opening scene that is dedicated to showing his childlike failure at selling ice? You learn later that Kristoff was adopted by the trolls, and distrusts other humans; so if Kristoff was actually homeless at the beginning of the movie, why did he have a sled and ice-harvesting tools at his disposal? (Or was he not homeless? Are we just supposed to be okay with his abduction?) My headcanon involves Kristoff having saved Sven from the cruelties of humans in his life — meeting the trolls — realizing that they&rsquo;re way better.</p>

<p>Olaf was a character I grimaced at in the movie trailers and ended up being pleasantly entertained by.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/olaf.gif" alt="Frozen poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">oh youu (<A href="http://worldbuiltfor2.tumblr.com/post/69015715475/when-someone-emotionally-hurts-you-but-you-have-to">via</a>)</p>


<p>Even though his main purpose is comedic entertainment, it would have been nice to see more about what he means to Anna and Elsa&rsquo;s relationship. He&rsquo;s their precious childhood snowman, and is really the only indication Anna has that Elsa still treasures her after years of being isolated.</p>

<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/olaf.jpg" alt="Frozen poster"/></p>

<p class="caption">love again, anna! do iiit! (<A href="http://www.rotoscopers.com/2013/09/27/ten-things-we-loved-about-the-new-frozen-trailer/">via</a>)</p>


<p>As for the last major-ish character, Hans: I wasn&rsquo;t too interested in him, and wish that all the time devoted to him was given to the other characters instead. Hans is too flat, an antagonist that comes out of nowhere, affects no one uniquely, and isn&rsquo;t redeemed. Anna could have been betrayed by any other person; Kristoff could have found any other, more character-specific reason to back off from being with Anna.</p>

<h2>In conclusion</h2>

<p>I had a lot of fun watching <em>Frozen</em>, particularly with the ~<em>twist</em>~ of Anna saving herself. And her kiss at the end with Kristoff was such consensual wow! Also, the particle effects were great.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is not a peaceful time in the Dells. The young King Nash clings to his throne while rebel lords in the north and south build armies to unseat him. The mountains and forests are filled with spies and thieves and lawless men.</p>

<p>This is where Fire lives. With a wild, irresistible appearance and hair the color of flame, Fire is the last remaining human monster. Equally hated and adored, she had the unique ability to control minds, but she guards her power, unwilling to steal the secrets of innocent people. Especially when she has so many of her own.</p>

<p>Then Prince Brigan comes to bring her to King City, The royal family needs her help to uncover the plot against the king. Far away from home, Fire begins to realize there&#8217;s more to her power than she ever dreamed. Her power could save the kingdom.</p>

<p>If only she weren&#8217;t afraid of becoming the monster her father was.</p></blockquote>


<p>[spoilers below]</p>

<p><em>Fire</em> was alright. I liked the strangeness of monsters and their many colors; I liked all the politics, the twist that Fire had killed her own father and the general confusion of royal bloodlines. As in <em><a href="/blog/2013/12/16/graceling/"/>Graceling</a></em>, the non-drama of sexual relationships is a relief. While reading, I hated Archer for being a posessive male character that we are meant to sympathize with; but thinking back, I don&rsquo;t think that his possessive behavior was ever excused by the story&hellip;except, I guess, for Fire&rsquo;s musing about how her innate monster beauty may have compelled Archer to become as horribly possessive as he was. This is uncomfortable because of its similarity to modern &ldquo;victim-blaming&rdquo; narratives, even if <em>Fire</em> explores Fire&rsquo;s strange ability to compel all humans when they look at her, not just men. It&rsquo;s also nice to see a romance not totally typical of YA: a non-virgin woman who falls in love with a man who already has a child.</p>

<p>One downside is that the voice of Fire herself doesn&rsquo;t differ too much from Katsa&rsquo;s in <em>Graceling</em>. Fire feels like a parallel universe Katsa, whose story ultimately isn&rsquo;t as interesting. One of the main reasons I was so attracted to the <em>Graceling</em> was — well — the Graces — and since the Dell doesn&rsquo;t have them, and since Katsa&rsquo;s world doesn&rsquo;t have monsters, this book feels like it&rsquo;s set in an entirely different universe. There&rsquo;s none of the excitement of familiarity, the fun of adding to the breadth and meaning of <em>Graceling</em>&rsquo;s world. The one connection between <em>Graceling</em> and <em>Fire</em> is Leck, but we barely know him from the first book, and I&rsquo;m not interested in any mysteries about how he came to be, since by the end of <em>Graceling</em> he&rsquo;s already dead. Leck&rsquo;s descent into sadism in <em>Fire</em> isn&rsquo;t particularly complex, either; he is shown to be a sociopath from the very beginning, and all interactions that he has with Fire feel tacked on and separate from Fire&rsquo;s own character growth. Had there been more of a commonality with <em>Graceling</em>, <em>Fire</em> would have been more of a hit with me.</p>

<blockquote><p>Katsa has been able to kill a man with her bare hands since she was eight - she&#8217;s a Graceling, one of the rare people in her land born with an extreme skill. As niece of the king, she should be able to live a life of privilege, but Graced as she is with killing, she is forced to work as the king&#8217;s thug.</p>

<p>When she first meets Prince Po, Graced with combat skills, Katsa has no hint of how her life is about to change.</p>

<p>She never expects to become Po&#8217;s friend.</p>

<p>She never expects to learn a new truth about her own Grace - or about a terrible secret that lies hidden far away&#8230;</p></blockquote>


<p>[spoilers below]</p>

<p>I finished <em>Graceling</em> and its companions in less than a week. I liked them — I liked the fairytale-ish turn of phrases (&ldquo;she had one eye blue and one eye green&rdquo;), the strangeness and OPness of Graces, the nondrama of sexual relationships. In <em>Graceling</em>, I can see how Katsa comes to like Po, and how her attraction to him is unique to her and her situation — being unable to trust that she wouldn&rsquo;t hurt anyone, he gives her a situation in which she can finally be herself.</p>

<p>The pacing was a little strange. One chapter near the beginning is devoted to exposition about the world, and is incredibly difficult to read through: there are so many new names to remember, so much information that gets in the way of the action I wanted to return to. The ending of the story drops suddenly as well: after Katsa primes the pirates to be ready for Leck&rsquo;s possible attack, it turns out Leck has already arrived at her supposed safehaven. Some of the motivations were tough for me to understand as well. How did Katsa and Po know so abruptly that Bitterblue was to be protected, at the cost of their own life? If Katsa was so adamant about not having children, why did she feel so strongly protective of Bitterblue? (I understand that you can not want to have children, and still like them; but there wasn&rsquo;t much other evidence for why Katsa would take to Bitterblue so strongly, especially given the distance with which she seemed to hold other acquaintances.) Why was Po ashamed of being blind? In fact, what was the purpose of those chapters at the end where the main Leck-related conflict has already been resolved, and all that&rsquo;s left is to angst about Po&rsquo;s blindness?</p>

<p>Overall <em>Graceling</em> was an entertaining read, and all the more fun because Katsa&rsquo;s &ldquo;true&rdquo; Grace was hinted at pretty well and it was fun to figure out for yourself what her talent actually was. I&rsquo;m also a fan of how she worked out what sort of relationship that she wanted with Po in the end, though, like with Brave, I felt a little dissonance with what she perceived marriage to be. It&rsquo;s strange to read fantasy and sit tight for explanations of multiple kingdoms and magic powers — and yet never be told why there are such conservative constructions of marriage, and why they have remained unchallenged. The limitations that we have in Real Life — patriarchy, religious morals — aren&rsquo;t elaborated on in <em>Graceling</em> and some other fantasy novels. It&rsquo;s strange to read books where misogyny exists because that&rsquo;s &ldquo;just the the way it is,&rdquo; even if characters challenge it later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After eight years using Blogger, I&rsquo;ve finally decided to move away. One of the first reasons I first started using it in high school was because Blogger was one of the only free hosting services I knew where I could also control the styling; but after several Blogger updates, and several years of telling myself I&rsquo;d eventually learn Blogger syntax well enough to style as I like, I&rsquo;ve given up. I have other things I&rsquo;d rather do than invest time parsing Blogger, and Octopres offers more built-in tools <em>and</em> flexibility: I can have <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/code/">nice code snippets</a> and have whatever extra scripts I&rsquo;d like without worrying they&rsquo;d interfere with Blogger esoterica. Additionally, after reading <a href="https://medium.com/p/c7cc156bc5d9">this article</a> I&rsquo;ve been a little more wary of data ownership, and with Octopress, I can host on Github where I know everything is mine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been eyeing <a href="https://ghost.org/">ghost</a> recently and though it looks awesome, I decided against it for now for several reasons. Currently, there&rsquo;s no easy way to import posts from Blogger, and I didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the extra overhead of figuring out where to host. A couple days ago I received access to Ghost&rsquo;s subscription hosting, but I don&rsquo;t want to commit to paying money when this blog is mostly for lolzy purposes.</p>

<p>So, this is how I got my blog set up again:</p>

<h2>Get Octopress Up and Running</h2>


<p>To actually figure out how to get Octopress running, I referenced several tutorials:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">Octopress: Blogging Basics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/applications/getting-started-with-octopress/">Webdesign Tuts+: Getting started with Octopress</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/22/goodbye-blogger-hello-octopress/">iAlja&#8217;s Blog: Goodbye Blogger, Hello Octopress!</a></li>
</ol>




<h2>Convert Old Blogger Posts to Be Octopress-Readable</h2>


<p>
From one of the previous links, I learned how to convert all my old posts to a form Octopress could work with. To do it, open up your old blog in blogger, then go to <code>Settings &gt; Other &gt; Export</code> to download your blog as an XML file. Then, I used <a href="https://gist.github.com/juniorz/1564581">this script</a> to run the conversion.</p>

<p>I ran into some issues here, mostly with titles that contained quotation marks or tags that contained colons; whenever this happened I went through the XML and just removed the symbols that were causing things to explode.</p>

<h2>Deploy to Github Pages</h2>


<p>Finally, I followed <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">these instructions</a> to deploy my blog for free to Github Pages. I still ran into some problems here — when I deployed, the online version of the blog on Github lacked all styles and scripts — this requried a change to the <code>root</code> in config.yml to be <code>/liwanag</code>, since on Github the blog is acccessed through the URL <a href="http://neauro.github.io/liwanag.">http://neauro.github.io/liwanag.</a> Making this change to root upsets the styles and scripts linking locally, though&hellip;so I&rsquo;ve still got to iron this out and find the magical tweaks that will allow one root value to work both locally and online. There&rsquo;s also the matter that my blog is big enough that running &ldquo;rake generate&rdquo; takes a minute or so to run&hellip;but I&rsquo;m willing to accept that for now.</p>

<h2>That&#8217;s it!</h2>


<p>As one final change, I&rsquo;ve changed the name of this blog. Previously, it was &ldquo;nuubu&rdquo; — a romanization of &ldquo;noob&rdquo; spelled in Japanese, chosen offhandedly because I originally intended this blog to be my corner for new things I&rsquo;ve learned. Because &ldquo;nuubu&rdquo; may be appropriative, and because I don&rsquo;t feel particularly strongly about clinging to the identity of &ldquo;noob&rdquo; anyway, I&rsquo;ve now named it &ldquo;liwanag,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;light&rdquo; in Tagalog. To be honest, I couldn&rsquo;t really think of another name at the time, and &ldquo;liwanag&rdquo; just sounds nice and makes me think of how blog-writing (that is, writing for an unknwon audience, or &ldquo;bringing things to light&rdquo;) helps me think more clearly.</p>

<p><a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com">nuubu</a> remains active, because many of the images linked to here point to where they&rsquo;ve been uploaded on Blogger, and because I don&rsquo;t want to lose what little bit of popularity those posts have accumulated (specifically, the Rosetta Stone error, and Alpacasso). But overall I&rsquo;m excited and happy for this bright new world. ✧ʕ̢̣̣̣̣̩̩̩̩·͡˔·ོɁ̡̣̣̣̣̩̩̩̩✧</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well! It&rsquo;s over.</p>

<p>I download <em>Allegiant</em> from the Seattle Public Library&rsquo;s eBook collection as soon as it became available, and read it over the course of a couple days, despite the looming presence of NaNoWriMo (which I&rsquo;ve been keeping track of in <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/nnwm2013">my Tumblr</a>).</p>

<p>[spoilers ahead]</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t have much to say about it. The writing wasn&rsquo;t that interesting. There are a smattering of issues that other reviews have already discussed — such as how Tris and Four&rsquo;s voices were barely distinguishable from each other, something especially tough to deal with when reading on a Kindle. In some places <em>Allegiant</em> felt repetitive. Tris was repeatedly described as either &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;pale,&rdquo; and it felt like eyes carried many of the discussions in this book. (Though I admit I&rsquo;m not overly fond in the first place of eyes described as communicating incredibly detailed emotions.)</p>

<blockquote>Now she looks pale and small, but her eyes make me think of wide-open skies that I have never actually seen, only dreamed of.</blockquote>




<blockquote>There is a wavering expression in her eyes, like she is a heap of leaves about to be scattered by the wind.</blockquote>




<blockquote>He has kept his eyes averted since I sat in the chair and they cut the strip of plastic binding my wrists together. For just for a moment, his eyes touch mine, and I know it’s time to start lying.</blockquote>




<blockquote>Her fingers are on his throat, taking his pulse, and her eyes are wide and empty. […] Her dark eyes are wide with fear as she says, “Are you hurt?”</blockquote>




<blockquote>She looks up at me, her eyes clear and eager.</blockquote>




<blockquote>She smiles, but her eyes are glassy, like a dormant part of her is fighting its way out and spilling over.</blockquote>


<p>I wasn&rsquo;t too interested in the big reveal of genetic tampering. Because it was just barely related to any events or concepts introduced in earlier books, it felt totally out of the blue. I could force a connection if I tried hard enough — maybe all the genetic stuff plays into the significance in earlier books about how &ldquo;one choice can define you&rdquo; —  but ultimately the genetic experiments felt unpleasantly disconnected and abrupt. Reveals are exciting and fun when you anticipate them, when you look back and realize that all the signs pointed toward them; not when they just slap you in the face under the guise of being totally mind-blowing.</p>

<p>I was also disappointed that two of the more obvious characters of color — Tori Wu, and Uriah — were killed off. Uriah&rsquo;s death acted solely as a catalyst for more of Four&rsquo;s angst, which he had enough of already, between worrying about his parents and worrying about his genetic purity. Tori&rsquo;s death accomplished nothing but the sorrow of a secondary character I hardly knew. Their deaths felt like a lazy way to get a rise out of the reader by taking away characters that had always been &ldquo;good people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the way that I feel about Tris&rsquo;s death as well. Her final reason for sacrificing herself wasn&rsquo;t related to anything else that she desired so desperately in the book: for her community to not die, for her to be with Four. I do like the twist in her character — how she first chose Dauntless, and then, in the end, chose again to be selfless Abegnation — but because I didn&rsquo;t see how it fit into an overall theme for the third book, this too felt like a cheap way to get me to have emotions about what was going on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried a couple times now to explain more about why the ending of Allegiant was so disappointing to me, but I&rsquo;ve found <a href="http://myallegiantreview.blogspot.com/2013/11/breaking-down-ending-to-allegiant.html">this blog post</a> that has already done all of the (super comprehensive) work.</p>

<p>The fact that this ending has, for many readers, &ldquo;ruined the entire series&rdquo; also reminds me of <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_kahneman_the_riddle_of_experience_vs_memory.html">this TED Talk</a>, in which the speaker talks about how the end of an experience can ruin the entire thing.</p>

<blockquote>But now there is another question: &#8220;How much did these patients think they suffered?&#8221; And here is a surprise. The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B. The stories of the colonoscopies were different, and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great &#8211; but one of them is this distinct &#8230; (Laughter) but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end; it&#8217;s a bad story. How do we know that? Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy, and much later, too, &#8220;How bad was the whole thing, in total?&#8221; And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.</blockquote>
