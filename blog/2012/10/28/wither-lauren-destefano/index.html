Their personalities clash and contrast in a way that&#8217;s fun to read, and their personalities also reflect the basic &#8220;archetypes&#8221; of this future world: people who are excited to buy in (Cecily), people who want to fight the supposed inevitable (Rhine), and people who just want &#8220;a luxurious place to die&#8221; (Jenna). Each character has their their own talents and even&nbsp;<i>use</i>&nbsp;them for things relevant to character emotion/development, for example Cecily knocking out furious symphonies on the piano when Jenna dies.<br /><br />In contrast, none of the male characters are that interesting. Linden, the grieving and oblivious head of house, is predictable and boring in his fumbling and innocent adoration of Rhine. The dark secrets of his wives (that they were abducted for his pleasure, that Jenna&#8217;s sisters were murdered when Jenna was taken) are kept from him, and I wish that he <i>had</i>&nbsp;learned of them, just to stir things up.&nbsp;Gabriel, a servant who is Rhine&#8217;s secret (and inevitable) love interest, is kinda cute in his sneaking candy to Rhine beneath breakfast pancakes, but isn&#8217;t anything more than a blue-eyed guy who is described to like ships. Ordinarily I would appreciate that Gabriel liked <i>something</i>, but unlike the girls having a talent and executing on it, Gabriel does little to prove he likes boats other than talk about it sometimes. I guess I would better appreciate ships being really integral to him &#8211; not just something in the side &#8211; I wish he looked out hazy-eyed as if to an ocean, I wish when he made pancakes for Rhine he shaped them not like towers but like ships. When he told Rhine she was named after a river I wish he hadn&#8217;t learned randomly, but that he had seen it because he was looking at rivers, imagining how he would sail them.<br /><br />I won&#8217;t go into too much detail of the flawed plot and world-building since other reviews do that quite well already, in particular <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/117137212">this one</a>, which points out that hurricanes can&#8217;t happen in a world where there are no more continents except North America. It also notes that if the polar ice caps had really melted in Rhine&#8217;s world, then very little of Florida, the book&#8217;s main setting, would be above water. I personally don&#8217;t mind if books are not scientifically plausible &#8211; it&#8217;s fiction! &#8211; but it did grate on me when Rhine, the main character, started learning about Christopher Columbus.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>I educate myself on the polar ice caps, vaporized long ago by warfare, and an explorer named Christopher Columbus who proved the earth was round.</i></blockquote><br />I guess it just figures that the world would be completely destroyed but the myth of Columbus would still somehow be perpetuated above anything else that&#8217;s ever happened in thousands of years of human history. Also uncomfortable is the ethnocentrism of North America being the only continent &#8220;technologically advanced&#8221; enough to escape world war as anything other than a tiny landmass invisible from space. I mean, you know other countries have technology too, right? People from other countries even <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/year/">win Nobel Prizes</a>!<br /><br />It also figures that memories of Asian countries of the future would be condensed into exotic caricatures, that Japan is nothing more than cherry blossoms and geishas, and India is nothing more than saris and bindis that the characters emulate by pressing stickers on their foreheads. This <i>isn&#8217;t</i>&nbsp;cultural appreciation; it&#8217;s an erasure of the fact that Japanese and Indian people are more than just neat costumes you wish you had.</div>
