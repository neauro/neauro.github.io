    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting <em>really</em> into anime and manga again, which happens occasionally. The last time this happened was with <a href="http://blog.neauro.com/2012-11-14-sword-art-online-so-pretty">Sword Art Online</a>, an anime I loved until the second season, which led the story down into an incestuous love triangle and a hideous, totally unncessary sexual assault scene.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an overview of some anime/manga I&rsquo;ve found recently.</p>

<h2>Anime: Kuragehime / 海月姫 / Princess Jellyfish</h2>

<blockquote>Amamizukan is an apartment complex where no boys are allowed. Tsukimi, a girl who adores jellyfish, lives there happily with her friends who all have nerdy obsessions of their own. Their peaceful lives gradually start to change when a beautiful woman helps Tsukimi out of a pinch. She stays overnight at the apartments—but it turns out "she" is really a "he". (<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=11282">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>Status: Complete. Genre: Jousei/Romance/Comedy.</p>

<p>H has been heavily encouraging me to watch this series for years and I finally set aside time for it after finding it on Netflix!</p>

<p>Reasons why you should watch it:</p>

<ul><li>It's legitimately hilarious. Even A, who generally despises anime, enjoyed it. <em>This is really saying something.</em></li>
<li>There are varied female characters! With varied appearances and varied interests!</li>
<li>Kuranosuke's crossdressing/femme presentation isn't used by the main cast as something to belittle him.</li>
<li>Surprisingly, it's the only story I've ever consumed where I didn't really mind the love triangle and felt like I was rooting for both sides of it.</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul> <li>The ending is pretty sudden.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Manga: Kuragehime / 海月姫 / Princess Jellyfish, HIGASHIMURA Akiko</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/animango/kuragehime_manga.jpg" alt="Picture from Kuragehime manga"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.mangareader.net/kuragehime">via</a>)</p>




<blockquote>Kuragehime follows Tsukimi Kurashita, an 18-year-old who moved from Kagoshima to Tokyo to become an illustrator. Tsukimi is a jellyfish otaku who comes to live in a shared bath and toilet, women-only apartment, Amamizukan. Other tenants include fujoshi, NEETs and others who consider fashion their natural enemy, calling themselves "Amars". One day, Tsukimi meets a fashionable and beautiful girl, Kuranosuke Koibuchi, who saves a jellyfish that is about to die at a pet shop. She later discovers that Kuranosuke is merely cross-dressing in order to evade inheritance of his father's occupation as a politician. (<a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=38146">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>Status: Ongoing. Genre: Jousei/Romance/Comedy.</p>

<p>Being dissatisfied with the anime&rsquo;s ending, I chased up the manga.</p>

<p>Reasons why you should read it:</p>

<ul><li>Though the rendering of events isn't as funny as in the anime, it's still pretty cute.</li>
<li>(spoilers) <span class="spoiler">The manga doesn't make it look as if Shuu is falling in love with the woman sexually blackmailing him, which is good.</span></li>
<li>The author also has short manga detailing events in her own life, and they're *such funny wow*.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Manga: Dengeki Daisy / 電撃デイジー, MOTOMI Kyousuke</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/animango/dengeki_daisy.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Kuragehime anime"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://dengekidaisy.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Chapters">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>After orphan Teru Kurebayashi loses her beloved older brother, she finds solace in the messages she exchanges with Daisy, an enigmatic figure who can only be reached through the cell phone her brother left her. Meanwhile, Teru meets and forms a strange friendship with mysterious Tasuku Kurosaki, her school's janitor. For some reason, Kurosaki always seems to be around whenever Teru needs help which leads Teru to wonder: Could Daisy be a lot closer than she thinks?</br></br>

As the mystery of Daisy unfolds, Teru also discovers that there may have been a lot more to the life and death of her brother than she ever dreamed...and that the man she thought was her friend just might have all the answers.(<a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=13582">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>Status: Ongoing. Genre: Shoujo/Romance/Comedy.</p>

<p>This was recommended to me by Tumblr friends.</p>

<p>Reasons why you should read it:</p>

<ul><li>It's <em>so cute wow</em>. If you need a heavy dose of thick, syrupy shoujo, this is it. <em>This is it.</em></li>
<li>Teru The Protagonist is an awesome female lead, and though there are some "damsel" moments, she mostly has impressive/fun moments where she saves herself and the entire day just when the author leads you to expect the opposite. (Wow such subversive!)</li>
<li>Teru also has friendships with other girls, both of whom she confides in and supports throughout the series.</li>
<li>There's a girl who could totally be slut-shamed, <em>and she isn't</em>.</li>
<li>This series is the first I've seen to depict a relationship growing significantly through communicating with each other digitally, which is pretty tight.</li>
<li>The main male lead is a HACKER! :'D</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul><li>It's really cheesy. <em>Really cheesy</em>. When you're not getting cavities, you're drowning in cheese. Though really, depending on your mood, this is kind of a plus.</li></ul>




<h2>Manga: Kamisama Hajimemashia | 神様はじめました / Kamisama Kiss, SUZUKI Julietta</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/animango/kh_manga.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Kuragehime anime"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.zerochan.net/1311703">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote> Momozono Nanami’s dad, a man with a penchant for gambling, disappeared after accumulating a huge amount of debt. Thus, she was chased out of her house by the debt collectors. When she met a timid guy being chased by a dog, he told her that he’d give her his house. She believed his persuasive talk, but when she went to his house… it turned out to be a shrine. Moreover, a guy with fox ears appeared, which made Nanami even more confused. What will become of homeless and confused Nanami? (<a href="http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=24388">via</a>) </blockquote>


<p>Status: Ongoing. Genre: Shoujo/Supernatural/Romance/Comedy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve actually been reading this for a while, but it&rsquo;s worth another shout-out because I&rsquo;ve been re-reading it and it&rsquo;s one of my favorite series to date, right up there with <em>Full Metal Panic!</em>.</p>

<p>Reasons why you should read it:</p>

<ul><li>The supernatural premise is fun, and the majority of the characters have a lot of charm. (The only one I can't totally get behind is Mizuki, mostly because he seems the most unnecessary to the plot.)</li>
<li>Nanami The Protagonist gets stuff done! Woo!</li>
<li>Tomoe is a well-developed male lead. He has bangs, a dark past, animal ears, cooking skills — everything you could ever possibly desire on this imperfect earth.</li>
<li>I really love Suzuki-sensei's unconventional-looking art style.</li>
<li>*Time paradox!*</li></ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul><li>Recent chapters (specifically, 92 and 107) have had some uncomfortable dubcon scenes. Ultimately Suzuki-sensei has handled these scenes in an <em>alright</em> way...but I wish she'd have her characters call out and condemn the problematic aspects head-on.</li>
<li>The story recently has also been slowing down and felt uncomfortably off-pace, though I'm not giving up on it just yet.</li></ul>




<h2>Anime: Kamisama Hajimemashita / 神様はじめました / Kamisama Kiss</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/animango/kh_anime.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Kuragehime anime"/></p>

<blockquote>After her father having run away due to gambling debts, and being evicted from her apartment, Nanami meets Mikage, a strange man who is afraid of dogs. Nanami "saves" Mikage from a dog and tells him her story. He gives Nanami his house as a thank you for saving him. Nanami accepts the offer, due to having nowhere else to go. Mikage draws her up a map showing her where to go. Upon arriving, she finds that it is a rundown shrine. Nanami is then almost killed by Tomoe, who was expecting Mikage to finally return after his 20 year absence. She is then greeted by both Onikiri and Kotetsu, as the new land god of the shrine. Unable to accept Nanami as the new land god, Tomoe mocks her then leaves the shrine, which, without Tomoe's power transforms back into a run-down state. Not wanting to rob Tomoe of his home and realizing that her powers as a god are too weak anyway Nanami leaves, but eventually is brought back by Tomoe after she seals a contract with him, making him her familiar.

<p>
Status: Complete. Genre: Shoujo/Supernatural/Romance/Comedy.</p>

<p>Reasons why you should watch it:</p>

<ul><li>Nanami's voice actress is perfectly casted. <em>Perfectly.</em></li>
<li>If you enjoyed the manga, you'd probably also enjoy seeing some of the scenes animated?</li></ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul><li>Nanami has less agency in the anime, and I don't Recent chapters (specifically, 92 and 107) have had some uncomfortable dubcon scenes. Ultimately Suzuki-sensei has handled these scenes in an <em>alright</em> way...but I wish she'd have her characters call out and condemn the problematic aspects head-on.</li>

<h2>Anime: Free! Iwatobi Swim Club</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/animango/free.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Kuragehime anime"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/09/25-1/second-season-of-free-anime-teased">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>Four boys named Haruka, Makoto, Nagisa and Rin all participated in a swimming tournament shortly before graduating elementary school and later parted ways. Years later, they reunite when Rin challenges Haruka to a race and wins. Not wanting to be defeated so easily, Haruka gathers Makoto and Nagisa and a new recruit named Rei to form the Iwatobi High School Swimming Club. (<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=15291">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>Status: Complete. Genre: Comedy/Sports&hellip;?</p>

<p>How could I not watch this? After all, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/swimming-anime"><em>the series that Tumblr made</em></a>.</p>

<p>Reasons why you should watch it:</p>

<ul><li>The animation is pretty. I even read on Tumblr that the actual swimming movements were pretty accurate. <em>Neat</em>.</li></ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul><li>The story is just alright.</li>
<li>Queer-baiting (used extensively here) is boring.</li></ul>




<h2>Anime: Kyoukai no Kanata / 境界の彼方 / Beyond the Boundary</h2>


<p><img class="book-cover" src="/images/animango/knk.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Kuragehime anime"/></p>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.zerochan.net/1570806">via</a>)</p>


<blockquote>Akihito Kanbara is a high school sophomore in the literature club who believes himself to be a "Meganest", and although he appears to be human, he is actually half Yōmu, which makes him invulnerable to wounds, due to the fact that he can heal so quickly, and also immortal. One day, Akihito meets freshman Mirai Kuriyama when it appears as if she is about to attempt suicide by jumping off of the school rooftop. Mirai is isolated because of her ability to manipulate blood, which is considered heresy even among other members of the underworld, so she is shunned. Soon after Akihito saves Mirai, disturbing events begin to arise. (<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=15546">via</a>)</blockquote>


<p>Status: Complete. Genre: Action/Romance/Comedy/Fantasy.</p>

<p>I was lured into watching this anime because of the gorgeous animation and my instant affinity for the main character, who has red glasses not totally unlike my own. Also, &ldquo;meganest&rdquo; in the description above stands for the fact that Akihito is really into women who wear glasses.</p>

<p>Reasons why you should watch it:</p>

<ul><li>Like <em>Free!</em>, also by Kyoto Animation, the animation (especially with the fight scenes) is gorgeous.</li>
<li>If, like me, you are a sucker for the forbidden romance between a "demon-type person" and "demon-slayer-type person" — well, here it is.</li>
<li>I love the ending song, which is Stereo Dive Foundation's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaHx6oENn9s">Daisy</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://seventhstyle.com/2013/08/10/kyoukai-no-kanata-goes-moeblob-in-anime-pv/">The moeblob is strong with this one.</a></li>
<li>The ending was rushed and I...still don't really get what happened.</li>
<li>The two main male characters are overly obsesssed with their fetishes. It's annoying at least and disturbing at worst, especially since the girl characters they're focusing their fetishes on are clearly uncomfortable.</li>
<li>To be honest, this series as a whole fell flat for me, but the eyecandy was quite filling.</li></ul>

<p class="caption">(<A href="http://www.magpictures.com/blackfish/">via</a>)</p>


<p>Documentaries are my whitenoise of choice. Due to studying, I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot more of them on Netflix.</p>

<p>More recently, I&rsquo;ve two documentaries about orcas: <em>Killer Whales</em> by the Discovery Channel, about the behavior of killer whales in the wild; and <em>Blackfish</em>, about orcas held in captivity. They&rsquo;re both pretty incredible; I&rsquo;m shocked at how much footage there is of killer whales doing things, whether it&rsquo;s hunting poisonous sting rays in New Zealand or yanking human beings into pools by their ankles.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hilarious to watch the footage of killer whales hunting seals in the first documentary, with a voiceover of a man marveling at their intelligence; and to watch this footage again in the second, where the background noise is preserved, and a woman is panicking, &ldquo;Oh no! Oh no! <em>On noooo</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Blackfish</em> also connected nicely with the last essay in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Science-Nature-Writing/dp/0547350635">The Best American Science and Nature Writing (2011)</a>, though the writer states there that one of the orca trainers was pulled by her hair into the water, whereas trainers in the <em>Blackfish</em> movie argue that this is a lie, another way to &ldquo;blame the victim&rdquo; of the orca attack, rather than the orca itself and the poor treatment that drove it to &ldquo;psychopathy.&rdquo;</p>

    <link href="http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2011/09/01/dogs-decoded-nova/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.neauro.com/blog/2011/09/01/dogs-decoded-nova</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I've been really into dogs recently (it goes with the whole <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/shiba-inu-musings.html">shiba inu thing</a>, I guess), so last night when I found a new documentary on dogs I jumped on it.  I've already watched a couple dog-related documentaries but this one still turned out to have some new information.  For one, the documentary pointed out that human emotions are not distributed evenly across the face.  If you were to split a person's face in half, and then mirror it to itself to get a complete human face, you'd end up getting two faces that have somewhat different "feelings" expressed in them.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W6UVeeNQG1k/Tl-opC3JTCI/AAAAAAAAAY8/pPXobU5YKGA/s1600/rightleft.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="353" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W6UVeeNQG1k/Tl-opC3JTCI/AAAAAAAAAY8/pPXobU5YKGA/s640/rightleft.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">to me, Right seems more confident; Left, benevolent</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There's also a theory that emotions are more faithfully represented in the right side of the face, which is, coincidentally, the side of the face that we as humans tend to look at first when examining a face.  They showed a study which showed this, outlining human gazes with lasers and showing that people generally looked at another person's right eye first, then the left -- but to me this kind of seems typical of how I would look at anything first.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4jjhTZGEbCE/Tl-o2rdlFaI/AAAAAAAAAZE/PNoP9qalNys/s1600/heatmap.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="530" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4jjhTZGEbCE/Tl-o2rdlFaI/AAAAAAAAAZE/PNoP9qalNys/s640/heatmap.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">for example. (<a href="http://www.t3node.com/blog/tiny-introduction-to-heatmaps/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I wonder if this still holds true for humans whose language reads from right to left.  Though, I guess regardless of whether the "leftward gaze" does hold true for humans, it does seem to hold true for dogs, who would also look to the right side of a human's face first.  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hLDQ9b7SEoc/Tl-o7mYOAqI/AAAAAAAAAZM/1z_ZFyI-09A/s1600/dogleft.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hLDQ9b7SEoc/Tl-o7mYOAqI/AAAAAAAAAZM/1z_ZFyI-09A/s640/dogleft.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">puppy dog eyes</td></tr></tbody></table><br />No other animals interact this way with humans, and no other dogs do this with other dogs.  It is almost as if <em>dogs have a special relationship to humans.  Whoa.</em><br /><br />Another special thing that dogs do: bark.  Wolves don't bark at all, but domesticated dogs have a variety of noises, which their owenrs can often interpret as <em>wanting to play</em>, <em>angry I hate strangers!</em>, etc.  In general, people tend to forget on how humans and dogs must have evolved together; in fact, when we think of how humans evolve we tend to look at primates like chimpanzees, but it turns out that chimps, like many other animals, don't understand the human gesture of pointing.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m_Kln1ikwHo/Tl-pACDW2wI/AAAAAAAAAZU/qdnphWcM6z4/s1600/chimppoint.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="356" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m_Kln1ikwHo/Tl-pACDW2wI/AAAAAAAAAZU/qdnphWcM6z4/s640/chimppoint.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wat lol give me food</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Pointing is a human gesture that is informative in nature, and helping someone to get food by pointing is something that seems to be pretty unique to humans/humans or humans/dogs.  Chimps in the wild would apparently never run into a situation where they would point at a banana to indicate its presence to another chimp, though wow, I would be really surprised if this were true.  Still, dogs' ability to read humans is so good that they not only follow pointing, they can follow human <em>gazes</em>.  Human eyes, by the way, are pretty easily followed, what with the white sclera and dark iris, and it may have evolved to be this way because it facilitated better communication.  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LRJ1GdKEpA0/Tl-pEETl7EI/AAAAAAAAAZc/cyv_gTGPB2o/s1600/eyes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="222" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LRJ1GdKEpA0/Tl-pEETl7EI/AAAAAAAAAZc/cyv_gTGPB2o/s400/eyes.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">o___o</td></tr></tbody></table><br />As for the evolution of dogs, genetic testing seems to prove that they undeniably came from wolves, and not any other dog-like creature like coyotes or foxes.  Dogs and wolves can even interbreed; but wolf cubs raised as closely with humans as puppies still don't grow up domesticated.  They don't react to the pointing thing, they aren't interested in hanging out for lols, etc.  So the domestication of dogs is definitely <em>nature</em> versus <em>nuture</em>.  In fact, some people in Russia made up an experiment in which they bred domestication into a species of silver fox, by allowing breeding between foxes only if they were not vicious toward the handlers.  Within six generations, researchers had some really adorable, tame foxes.  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_aeyZhUKHIQ/Tl-pHsY5-iI/AAAAAAAAAZk/NR2eB15DE6E/s1600/tamefox.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_aeyZhUKHIQ/Tl-pHsY5-iI/AAAAAAAAAZk/NR2eB15DE6E/s400/tamefox.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I can hear Tumblr crying out</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Though it turned out, that, the more domesticated silver foxes became...  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L5OMP-H1zPk/Tl-pKpzSWUI/AAAAAAAAAZs/9dj_OUMgZxw/s1600/fluffy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="179" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L5OMP-H1zPk/Tl-pKpzSWUI/AAAAAAAAAZs/9dj_OUMgZxw/s320/fluffy.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">unnff so fluffy</td></tr></tbody></table><br />...the more their physical appearance changed.

I am excited to go back home and stop programming (on others' whims) for a while, though one semi-sad thing I must accept is that I will probably have to wait a while to have a stable living situation and stable amount of money before getting the shiba inu that's been keeping me going all summer. &nbsp;It'll just be too hard to manage rent, tuition, <i>and</i>&nbsp;a dog, at least for a while.</div>

&quot;wat lol give me food&quot; is an impulse that I&#39;m starting to realize is really hard to get rid of in general.  Free food at work all the time == me overeating all the time.  It&#39;s so delicious and so painful</div>
