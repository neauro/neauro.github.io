<p>Documentaries are my whitenoise of choice. Due to studying, I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot more of them on Netflix.</p>

<p>More recently, I&rsquo;ve two documentaries about orcas: <em>Killer Whales</em> by the Discovery Channel, about the behavior of killer whales in the wild; and <em>Blackfish</em>, about orcas held in captivity. They&rsquo;re both pretty incredible; I&rsquo;m shocked at how much footage there is of killer whales doing things, whether it&rsquo;s hunting poisonous sting rays in New Zealand or yanking human beings into pools by their ankles.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hilarious to watch the footage of killer whales hunting seals in the first documentary, with a voiceover of a man marveling at their intelligence; and to watch this footage again in the second, where the background noise is preserved, and a woman is panicking, &ldquo;Oh no! Oh no! <em>On noooo</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Blackfish</em> also connected nicely with the last essay in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Science-Nature-Writing/dp/0547350635">The Best American Science and Nature Writing (2011)</a>, though the writer states there that one of the orca trainers was pulled by her hair into the water, whereas trainers in the <em>Blackfish</em> movie argue that this is a lie, another way to &ldquo;blame the victim&rdquo; of the orca attack, rather than the orca itself and the poor treatment that drove it to &ldquo;psychopathy.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I've been really into dogs recently (it goes with the whole <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/shiba-inu-musings.html">shiba inu thing</a>, I guess), so last night when I found a new documentary on dogs I jumped on it.  I've already watched a couple dog-related documentaries but this one still turned out to have some new information.  For one, the documentary pointed out that human emotions are not distributed evenly across the face.  If you were to split a person's face in half, and then mirror it to itself to get a complete human face, you'd end up getting two faces that have somewhat different "feelings" expressed in them.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W6UVeeNQG1k/Tl-opC3JTCI/AAAAAAAAAY8/pPXobU5YKGA/s1600/rightleft.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="353" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W6UVeeNQG1k/Tl-opC3JTCI/AAAAAAAAAY8/pPXobU5YKGA/s640/rightleft.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">to me, Right seems more confident; Left, benevolent</td></tr></tbody></table><br />There's also a theory that emotions are more faithfully represented in the right side of the face, which is, coincidentally, the side of the face that we as humans tend to look at first when examining a face.  They showed a study which showed this, outlining human gazes with lasers and showing that people generally looked at another person's right eye first, then the left -- but to me this kind of seems typical of how I would look at anything first.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4jjhTZGEbCE/Tl-o2rdlFaI/AAAAAAAAAZE/PNoP9qalNys/s1600/heatmap.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="530" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4jjhTZGEbCE/Tl-o2rdlFaI/AAAAAAAAAZE/PNoP9qalNys/s640/heatmap.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">for example. (<a href="http://www.t3node.com/blog/tiny-introduction-to-heatmaps/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I wonder if this still holds true for humans whose language reads from right to left.  Though, I guess regardless of whether the "leftward gaze" does hold true for humans, it does seem to hold true for dogs, who would also look to the right side of a human's face first.  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hLDQ9b7SEoc/Tl-o7mYOAqI/AAAAAAAAAZM/1z_ZFyI-09A/s1600/dogleft.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hLDQ9b7SEoc/Tl-o7mYOAqI/AAAAAAAAAZM/1z_ZFyI-09A/s640/dogleft.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">puppy dog eyes</td></tr></tbody></table><br />No other animals interact this way with humans, and no other dogs do this with other dogs.  It is almost as if <em>dogs have a special relationship to humans.  Whoa.</em><br /><br />Another special thing that dogs do: bark.  Wolves don't bark at all, but domesticated dogs have a variety of noises, which their owenrs can often interpret as <em>wanting to play</em>, <em>angry I hate strangers!</em>, etc.  In general, people tend to forget on how humans and dogs must have evolved together; in fact, when we think of how humans evolve we tend to look at primates like chimpanzees, but it turns out that chimps, like many other animals, don't understand the human gesture of pointing.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m_Kln1ikwHo/Tl-pACDW2wI/AAAAAAAAAZU/qdnphWcM6z4/s1600/chimppoint.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="356" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m_Kln1ikwHo/Tl-pACDW2wI/AAAAAAAAAZU/qdnphWcM6z4/s640/chimppoint.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wat lol give me food</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Pointing is a human gesture that is informative in nature, and helping someone to get food by pointing is something that seems to be pretty unique to humans/humans or humans/dogs.  Chimps in the wild would apparently never run into a situation where they would point at a banana to indicate its presence to another chimp, though wow, I would be really surprised if this were true.  Still, dogs' ability to read humans is so good that they not only follow pointing, they can follow human <em>gazes</em>.  Human eyes, by the way, are pretty easily followed, what with the white sclera and dark iris, and it may have evolved to be this way because it facilitated better communication.  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LRJ1GdKEpA0/Tl-pEETl7EI/AAAAAAAAAZc/cyv_gTGPB2o/s1600/eyes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="222" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LRJ1GdKEpA0/Tl-pEETl7EI/AAAAAAAAAZc/cyv_gTGPB2o/s400/eyes.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">o___o</td></tr></tbody></table><br />As for the evolution of dogs, genetic testing seems to prove that they undeniably came from wolves, and not any other dog-like creature like coyotes or foxes.  Dogs and wolves can even interbreed; but wolf cubs raised as closely with humans as puppies still don't grow up domesticated.  They don't react to the pointing thing, they aren't interested in hanging out for lols, etc.  So the domestication of dogs is definitely <em>nature</em> versus <em>nuture</em>.  In fact, some people in Russia made up an experiment in which they bred domestication into a species of silver fox, by allowing breeding between foxes only if they were not vicious toward the handlers.  Within six generations, researchers had some really adorable, tame foxes.  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_aeyZhUKHIQ/Tl-pHsY5-iI/AAAAAAAAAZk/NR2eB15DE6E/s1600/tamefox.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_aeyZhUKHIQ/Tl-pHsY5-iI/AAAAAAAAAZk/NR2eB15DE6E/s400/tamefox.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I can hear Tumblr crying out</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Though it turned out, that, the more domesticated silver foxes became...  <br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L5OMP-H1zPk/Tl-pKpzSWUI/AAAAAAAAAZs/9dj_OUMgZxw/s1600/fluffy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="179" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L5OMP-H1zPk/Tl-pKpzSWUI/AAAAAAAAAZs/9dj_OUMgZxw/s320/fluffy.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">unnff so fluffy</td></tr></tbody></table><br />...the more their physical appearance changed.  For example, their their coloring became lighter...  <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-itzWdcevWGE/Tl-pNlPqiWI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/wozMLjX4Vao/s1600/whitefox.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-itzWdcevWGE/Tl-pNlPqiWI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/wozMLjX4Vao/s320/whitefox.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>...their ears started to maintain floppiness, and their tails started to curl.  <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FdyF-rXYbxk/Tl-pQlJyUyI/AAAAAAAAAZ8/Pq36dCDLrS8/s1600/curltail.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="179" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FdyF-rXYbxk/Tl-pQlJyUyI/AAAAAAAAAZ8/Pq36dCDLrS8/s320/curltail.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>In fact, they started looking like DOGS.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zjgis5aZH8A/UCLxkBHzs-I/AAAAAAAAB-g/rFyETu3-yOw/s1600/4115686100_fb46a52000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="264" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zjgis5aZH8A/UCLxkBHzs-I/AAAAAAAAB-g/rFyETu3-yOw/s320/4115686100_fb46a52000.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/salty_soul/4115686100/">Jason Hargrove</a>, used under CC</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Meaning basically that, if you select for tameness in a wild kinda-dog-like creature, you'll end up selecting for physically dog-like qualities.<br /><br />In other news, I got a job as a game designer! &nbsp;(I guess I didn't do as bad as <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/08/on-speaking-through-wires.html">I thought</a>.) I am excited to go back home and stop programming (on others' whims) for a while, though one semi-sad thing I must accept is that I will probably have to wait a while to have a stable living situation and stable amount of money before getting the shiba inu that's been keeping me going all summer. &nbsp;It'll just be too hard to manage rent, tuition, <i>and</i>&nbsp;a dog, at least for a while.</div>

&quot;wat lol give me food&quot; is an impulse that I&#39;m starting to realize is really hard to get rid of in general.  Free food at work all the time == me overeating all the time.  It&#39;s so delicious and so painful</div>

Wat lol give me food - applies to undergraduates doing research studies too, not just dogs. :)</div>
