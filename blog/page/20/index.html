Man, that jumping mechanic was hard to get the hang of.<br /><br />From the beginning I had a definite <em>Ender&#8217;s Game</em>-y feeling that my mission (something to the effect of &#8220;Go to an alien planet to disarm a bomb pointing at the earth!&#8221;) was not what it seemed.  Sober, slow piano does not exciting background music to alien killing make.  The hint/instruction system, in the form of your commander in the top-left corner, also plays its part distributing uneasy feelings: though the earth is in imminent danger, the commander does not worry about its people but rather spends time giving you instruction, praising you when you launch yourself aggressively at alien ships (<em>&#8220;Nice shot!&#8221;</em>), and grumbling when you reach new sectors in the alien world (e.g. <em>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never understand this place.</em>&#8221;).<br /><br />Still, I move on.  Why?  Because it&#8217;s a game, I guess.  It&#8217;s a challenge.  There are glowing things in the environment, that&#8217;s pretty nice.  Someone is telling me to press on.  It&#8217;s not quite the same as <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> where I can see my goal (sleeping there peacefully in the big main shrine), but as per your usual game, all you can do within its realm is move forward.<br /><br />The game rewards you at the end with a poem or song which speaks about how <em>sacrifice will always be remembered</em>, and it reminds me of <a href="http://gawker.com/5847338/steve-jobs-was-not-god">this article</a>&nbsp;on Gawker, about Steve Jobs&#8217; death:<br /><br /><blockquote>Real outpourings of public grief should be reserved for those people who lived life so heroically and selflessly that they stand as shining examples of love for all of humanity. People like, for example, the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, who—along with his family—was bombed, beaten, and stabbed during his years of principled activism in the US civil rights movement. Shuttlesworth died yesterday, the same day as Steve Jobs. He did not die a billionaire.<br /><br />All deaths are sad for the living. Everyone deserves to be mourned, and well-known people will inevitably be mourned more loudly than others. But it is actually important to keep our grief in perspective. When we start mourning technocrats as idols, we cheapen the lives of those who have sacrificed more for their fellow man.</blockquote><br />For me, there&#8217;s no constructive thought to be had in playing obituary olympics, but it does make me think more about what it means to &#8220;cheapen&#8221; someone&#8217;s life.  Is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Shuttlesworth">Reverend Shuttlesworth</a> cheapened because no one laid iPad candles on his grave?  In contrast, is Jobs&#8217; life posthumously enriched by the Tweets of gadget-wielding strangers?<br /><br />If life can be viewed as a brief (normal, chemical) candle flame, I think that the best way to cheapen it, to waste someone&#8217;s &#8220;sacrifice,&#8221; would be to let that person&#8217;s flame die out without ever touching yours.  It&#8217;s hard to imagine what I, as a Filipino girl, can do to feel or express what I would feel comfortable calling &#8220;true reverence&#8221; for the death of a black man activist minister who lived so far away.  Shuttlesworth&#8217;s (and Job&#8217;s) work might not have been done; but we continue it in doing the best by others, and by our selves.  All we can do is move forward.</div>

I&#8217;m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.  You&#8217;ve got to find what you love, and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers.  Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.  And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.  If you haven&#8217;t found it yet, keep looking, and don&#8217;t settle.  As with all matters of the heart, you&#8217;ll know when you find it.  And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.  So keep looking.  Don&#8217;t settle.<br /><br />Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.  You are already naked.  There is no reason not to follow your heart.</blockquote><br /><br />My first class this week for my HCDE program started with the usual ice breakers, and led eventually to our professor hauling out dozens of <em>Wired</em> magazines from the early 90s, just as oddly textured and bright neon as the <em>Wired</em> magazines of present day.  One of the first things that I saw in my Septemer 1998 issue was an advertisement for FAT32, Microsoft&#8217;s newest, fastest and most efficient file system.  One of the main features of this particular issue was Furby, and there was also a smaller article whose intent was to &#8220;debunk memes;&#8221; Bluetooth, it said, was estimated to be a hot topic for about the next 24 months, and would only really be marketable once portable devices like PDAs came to be everywhere.  <em>And even then, people looking to move data between gadgets might find it hard to sever their emotional connection to the entrenched wireline option.</em><br /><br />We started sharing articles.  Someone mentioned that in his issue, Apple was bringing back Steve Jobs as a consultant, and our professor said, &#8220;And that pretty much saved the company, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221;<br /><br />I guess it&#8217;s strange to think that this history of &#8220;silly technology&#8221; &#8211; digital cameras boasting a whole three feet of electrical cord, failed internet &#8220;walled gardens&#8221; like AOL and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)">Prodigy</a> &#8211; is really quite young.  The Macintosh computer (pitched to shareholders in 1984) was the first commercially successful computer with a graphical user interface, and that computer, for me, is the cornerstone of what I&#8217;m studying now.  Human-Computer Interaction is not only my academic focus but something that permeates <em>my life</em>; I am at a computer or interacting with things thanks to computers throughout my day more often than I am not.  Working, writing papers for class, corresponding, paying bills, learning about health insurance and oppression and red spider lilies&#8230;<br /><br />COOL MAN, STEVE.  I&#8217;m glad that technology&#8217;s history (and future?) is marked not with <em>Let&#8217;s use this to get all the money</em>, but rather with, <em>Let&#8217;s do this because this is what we love.</em></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<br />I&#8217;ve recently come into the bittersweet situation in which I am too busy actually doing things to write about them.<br /><br />In particular, since my new job at Fugazo reimbursed me for an iPod Touch, I have been playing tons of games on it, as well as exploring this previously mysterious world of being able to take pictures or video of whatever I want to on the fly.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OMKiFF1sHwg/ToecxPNVHVI/AAAAAAAAAdc/SSzbWDm5rh0/s1600/tumblr_ls8ry5Bjz11qdycalo1_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OMKiFF1sHwg/ToecxPNVHVI/AAAAAAAAAdc/SSzbWDm5rh0/s320/tumblr_ls8ry5Bjz11qdycalo1_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">not that my iPod is as good as my 35mm</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><h3>Hot Springs Story</h3>The first game that I ended up actually purchasing was <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id408854559">Hot Springs Story</a> (or, &#8220;SpaVille,&#8221; according to Andou).  It was developed by Kairosoft, which also made <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/game-dev-story/id396085661?mt=8">Game Dev Story</a>, beloved by so many real game developers.  I didn&#8217;t like Game Dev Story too much, but was immediately hooked by Hot Springs Story, due in the majority to this screenshot from <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2011/03/03/hot-springs-story-review/">Touch Arcade</a><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SscUwZBoLSE/ToefLRaWnTI/AAAAAAAAAdk/OWbpgtd5Vz0/s1600/mzl.pniydziy.320x480-75.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SscUwZBoLSE/ToefLRaWnTI/AAAAAAAAAdk/OWbpgtd5Vz0/s320/mzl.pniydziy.320x480-75.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://toucharcade.com/2011/03/03/hot-springs-story-review/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In Game Dev Story, you start out in a full, gray, square office.  In Hot Springs Story, you start out in this hardwood- and tatami-floor building which is both surrounded and filled by all these trees and blossoming plants which change their appearance throughout the season.  It&#8217;s also, to me, filled with less complexity in the beginning of the game; in GDS you&#8217;re immediately given all these options about what programmer to hire for your project, and all the potential programmers have all these different skills, and it&#8217;s so confusing.  What do these skills even mean yet?!<br /><br />HSS is pretty similar &#8211; a lot of the small icons aren&#8217;t understandable and a lot of the mechanics are something you grow into or discover later in game (for example, what &#8220;compatible facilities&#8221; are and what they do), but in HSS it felt a little more forgiving to make mistakes in the beginning.  The feeling of productivity also came more easily in HSS; you could set down trees and see the happy little &#8220;Scenery increased!&#8221; pop-ups, or else see people come in and level up in satisfaction, and so forth.<br /><br />I also started giving Pocket Academy a try today, but like GDS it has such a variety of options and &#8220;chances of messing up&#8221; from the very beginning that it almost stresses me out to play. Thanks to HSS, though, I think I&#8217;m getting the hang of Pocket Academy&#8217;s rules more easily, and I do like that Pocket Academy allows you to have a more personal connection with gameworld entities.  In HSS every guest is a faceless instance of a catergory of customers &#8211; a &#8220;Hiker,&#8221; a &#8220;Young Couple&#8221; &#8211; but in Pocket Academy every student and teacher has a name and a set of strengths and weaknesses which are all level-up-able.  You can even see which students are friends with which!  It&#8217;s a veritable Dwarf Fortress.<br /><br /><br /><h3>The Secret of Chateau de Moreau</h3><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mgiYp9F5XNs/Toer10BUzVI/AAAAAAAAAds/LP1UbeMdSVo/s1600/Chateau-De-Moreau1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="142" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mgiYp9F5XNs/Toer10BUzVI/AAAAAAAAAds/LP1UbeMdSVo/s320/Chateau-De-Moreau1.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://ifanzine.com/the-secret-of-chateau-de-moreau-giveaway-2-10-itunes-gift-cards-up-for-grabs">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Chateau de Moreau went on sale recently and after seeing something in a review to the effect of &#8220;this game is like Phoenix Wright&#8221; I grabbed it immediately.  It&#8217;s essentially an adventure game wrapped around a mystery.  The Count, your adoptive father, is dead; can you prove that you, the apparent inheritor of all his wealth, didn&#8217;t murder him?  It&#8217;s quite like Phoenix Wright in the conversations you get to have with characters and the dinner scenes each night, which are like the court scenes in Ace Attorney.  The characters are interesting to get to know, clichéd as some of them are (The Responsible Eldest Son, The Cheerful/Ditzy Maid).  My only problem with it thus far is that it&#8217;s too hard to move around the chateau using a touchscreen &#8211; I wish I could just click rooms and head directly to them, instead of clumsily moving the character through this sparse black-and-white overhead map step by step.  In fact, why does there need to be a map in the first place?  In the two hours that I&#8217;ve played the game thus far I can&#8217;t think of one instance in which I thought, <em>Wow, this is a great use of an overhead map that is nothing but white lines and text on a black background.</em><br /><br />The mansion has a ton of rooms, but only a subset of them are unlocked and actually visit-able in each chapter.  So why even show those other rooms?  Is the sense of the largeness of the chateau worth conveying hand-in-hand with the frustration that comes when all but four of the rooms of that huge chateau are inexplicably locked?<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>Sword and Sworcery</h3><br /><br /><center><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="265" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/10066962?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="400"></iframe><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/10066962">Walk in the Woods</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/sworcery">Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery </a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a></center><br /><br /><a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/">Alex</a> has been encouraging me to play this game for its <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/brainhex/seeker.html">Seeker</a> quality unusual to iOS games.  It is the type of game that is fun to just &#8221;<em>be</em> in&#8221; &#8211; to look at that calm forest all pixelated and yet somehow filled with so much depth.  The dialogue and world-building is also hilarious at times.  Scythians, dude.  They hate those rainbows.</div>

<center><iframe width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VZAuKkv4eZE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br /><br /><em>[Spoiler warning.]</em><br /><br />When Kelly first showed me the trailer for <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/107100/">Bastion on Steam</a>, I was skeptical &#8211; mostly because of the rough old Western voice, the mention of a distillery.  It&#8217;s the sort of thing that a girl like me hears and thinks, <em>This game was not made with me in mind.  Not sure I&#8217;m really feeling this one.</em><br /><br />But the trailer absolutely hooked me, precisely at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZAuKkv4eZE&feature=youtu.be&t=2m33s">this part.</a><br /><br /><em>Wait.  Wait.  There&#8217;s a STORY.</em><br /><br />I finished it over the course of two days, though admittedly I didn&#8217;t farm as much as I could have; I focused my attentions on the War Machete and Scrap Musket, and then later, the Galleon Mortar, which is awesome because it can <em>go over walls</em>.  Besides the gorgeous graphics, voice acting, and storytelling, I realized that what makes Bastion super special is its logistical gameplay, which I learned about recently from <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2010/03/flydrill-and-logistical-gameplay.html">Alex</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote><strong>Logistical gameplay</strong> revolves around choosing how to allocate your resources - which upgrades to invest in, how much to spend, how much to save, and how to manage your time and effort effectively for the greatest payoff. The pleasure of Logistical gameplay is not in simply doing something, but in doing it well - optimizing it to perfection. This is why achievements are so important. They give the player a reason to excel.</blockquote><br />Logistical gameplay, according to <em>21st Century Game Design</em>, is preferred by 50% of the US population (pg. 910), which makes it special and important.  (Though this same book has statements like &#8220;Often, little thought is given to players who are trying to play [a] game for short, intermittent periods of time,&#8221; which is something that definitely gets more attention now thanks to Facebook and smartphone games.)<br /><br />So why is Bastion so logistical?<br /><br /><h3>There are a variety of ways to pair your weapons (and magic spell thing),</h3>all of which lead you to interact with the game world in different ways.  I am a sucker for fast, DPS-y weapons, so as soon as I discovered the War Machete I stuck with it all the way, but Andou apparently farmed the heck out of this game and discovered things like if you pair the Fang Repeater and Dual Pistols, you can shoot fast by alternating shots, and when reloading one gun you end up reloading both.  Wat!<br /><br />Passive abilities obtained by equipping distillery drinks also increases the amount that you can optimize your strategies and play.<br /><br /><h3>There are a variety of ways to upgrade each weapon;</h3>for example, you can choose to make War Machete have intense critical hit damage, give it the ability to poison enemies to kill them over time, or double up on the damage it could make if thrown as a range weapon.  With the Scrap Musket, you could choose to increase its dealt damage or else its spread or throwback.  So, the same two weapons can now be used in a variety of strategies &#8211;<br /><ul><li>Musket to throw back enemies, then throw Machete to poison and eliminate at a distance</li><li>use Machete to deal a lot of damage to enemies in a close area, then use Musket to finish up</li><li>use Machete to poison a ton of enemies in a close area, then use Musket to throw them back</li><li>etc.</li></ul><br /><h3>Upgrading your weapons to the max doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;ll be too over-powered to play the game</h3>because in Bastion you can use the idols of gods to make your enemies more resilient.  Hense (Goddess of Pain and Pleasure) will make enemies more aggressive in general, whereas Yudrig (God of Impulse and Bravery) make enemies cause damage on contact; other idols can make enemies drop live grenades when killed, or else make them <em>never</em> drop anything (including potions to replenish life and magic)&#8230;<br /><br />I remember really liking this balancing mechanism in <em>The World Ends With You</em> as well; even if you farm out all the enemies in the area, you could go into the menu and increase the enemies&#8217; strength for bigger payout in experience, money, and items.  But, bonus points to Bastion for making all the idols interesting to discover and see, and making them (and all the weapons, actually) relevant to the story as well.  Plus, since you can actually control the ways in which enemies become more powerful, you can change The Kid&#8217;s equipment and passive abilities up to optimally address whatever constraints you decided to invoke.<br /><br />So, hurray for Bastion: a happy, focused marriage of strong gameplay and storytelling.</div>

Yay, you wrote a blog post kind of about something I told you about! Cool! :D<br /><br />It&#39;s funny, reading all these details about the weapon system in Bastion makes me realize that I&#39;ve *never* played a game that involves logistical gameplay to this extent. At least, outside of strategy games, which is a different sort of thing. I&#39;ve never played a game where I was really using logistical skills or choices in weapons and items I used. Actually, looking at all the types, whether tactical or strategic or diplomatic or whatever, it&#39;s amazing how little I understand in terms of concrete specifics. My understanding is so vague and academic, it&#39;s funny. :p<br /><br />PS - there&#39;s a typo in the title! Log(t)istical?</div>

I&#8217;m finding myself making sure that locations on Padmapper are near bus lines by typing in addresses into Google Maps, and I did this too when trying to find a place to live in San Francisco this summer.<br /><br />Actually, even listing &#8220;nearby bus lines&#8221; would just be helpful.  (Though not as helpful if you&#8217;re not familiar with a city&#8217;s public transportation, as was the case with me, SF, and BART.)<br /><br />That being said, using Padmapper thus far instead of just scrolling text ads on Craigslist has made apartment hunting a little more fun.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
So much (mostly online) research on shiba inu has gotten dog-related information spilling out of my ears, so I decided to keep it all <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApA7ip7Sl9C8dC1uM0V3TEQ5R19pVmVGNjRSZjkyeEE&amp;hl=en_US">organized</a>.<br /><br />Here are the more interesting things I learned, which may only be interesting and novel because I have never owned a dog before:<br /><br /><br /><h3>There is such a thing as a raw food diet for pets.</h3>The diet has you feeding your dog raw meat &#8211; chicken, beef, pork, deer.  There is also a &#8220;prey model&#8221; variation in which meat is fed to an animal in the same proportions and states that it would obtain in natural settings.  (To illustrate, there&#8217;s a weirdly endearing photo of a kitten feasting on a cottontail rabbit on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_feeding#Prey_model">wikipedia page</a>.)<br /><br />In addition to raw food research, I was surprised to learn that some pet foods like Purina, which always seemed pretty classy, is apparently <a href="http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/purina-dog-chow/">really bad</a>.<br /><br />To me, the take-aways of a raw diet are as follows:<br /><br /><ul><li>Dogs are carnivores.  Eating raw meat, along with loving you, is what it has evolved to do.</li><li>Some kibble is highly processed and contains questionable items like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omnivore%27s_Dilemma">corn and soy</a>.</li><li>The <a href="http://truthaboutpetfood.com/articles/they-talk-but-can-they-give-answers.html">advertising</a> and studies behind pet food can also be questionable, as someone discovered when she called pet food companies to ask about the content of the food and how it was made.</li><li>Raw meat and meaty bones (RMBs) scrub a dog&#8217;s mouth more effectively than kibble or even kibble specialized to brush your dog&#8217;s teeth.  Also, raw diets may lead to a dog smelling better, being more energetic and obedient, and feeling nicer to the touch.</li><li>Though there is bacteria and parasites in raw meat, there are things you can do to lessen the chance of infection in your dog, and in general dogs are pretty well-built to withstand the stuff that they put in their mouths.</li></ul><br />I&#8217;ve looked at a lot of sites about this topic, some that speak <a href="http://rawfed.com/myths/">more strongly</a> than others, and though the overall consensus is that there is &#8220;no data&#8221; for whether a raw food diet is noticeably better for your dog or not, I&#8217;m more inclined treat the food industry with suspicion concerning the questionable things it already does to humans.  That being said, I would feel torn feeding a shiba something like beef knowing that cows are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAFO">raised so badly</a> anyway.<br /><br />Still, the idea of feeding a shiba inu a nice fresh fish makes me happy.  Also, now that I think about it, my old cat Dusty didn&#8217;t subsist completely on pet food either; he had dry kibble and also human tuna, which we started feeding him once a day (and which he loved) after he got urinary tract infection and had to have surgery.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/4137744452/in/photostream" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0R0GvnE5Yyw/TmcXLLVI-0I/AAAAAAAAAc8/YBSoh4SQMl4/s640/4137744452_149316bb07.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">if my lola&#8217;s cats can handle this, i&#8217;m sure US cats can too</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />As a note, I found <a href="http://rawfeddogs.net/Recipes/">a website with a variety of raw food recipes</a> &#8211; though I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was expecting when I started browsing it, hahaha.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>Raw bones are okay to give to a dog; cooked bones aren&#8217;t.</h3>Cooking makes bones brittle and easily splintered, which is not good.<br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/t10yEI64nzc" width="560"></iframe></center><br /><br /><br /><h3>Dog-training is like programming.</h3>Someone on the Shiba Inu Forum <a href="http://www.shibainuforum.org/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=8321">complained that her puppy was &#8220;stealth peeing,&#8221;</a> saying, &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t give any warning when she pees on the carpet - she&#8217;ll be sitting and she&#8217;ll stand up and pee. No sound, no movement around looking for a place to go. Just up and squat, done in a second.  Generally, we try to grab her and take her outside as soon as we see it, but she&#8217;s usually done before we can grab her&#8230;&#8221;<br /><br />To which someone replied, &#8220;This may be a habit she has picked up. She may have learned that if she pees a little bit, you will take her outside to pee.&#8221;<br /><br />And for some reason this amazed me.  Dogs are <em>literal</em>.  Quite computer-like.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>Dogs become easily hydrated, but are also easily over-watered,</h3>which can lead to messes.  Who knew?  When I had Dusty, I just allowed him to have access to water all day.  I guess when you have puppies, it&#8217;s a good idea to give them water and monitor them and make sure you can take them outside when you can.<br /><br /><br /><br />To conclude, here is another shiba inu video that Kelly showed me, to remind me of what the point of all this trouble is.<br /><br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hwvCDA5CuEc" width="420"></iframe></center></div>

For some reason what I really want to feed a dog is fish!  Raw fish, or maybe little fish snacks.  Hopefully I can find ones with no added salt once the time comes!</div>

Just make sure you don&#39;t feed your dog overly-seasoned foods (salty, etc) or feed them off the table. The former is unhealthy and the latter will teach them bad manners, even though their adorable behavior may make you want to give in :P</div>

Nowadays I get easily frustrated by movies.  The last straw was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Perfect_(1997_film)">Picture Perfect</a>.  The main character, a woman, decides to focus on her career instead of on men, and succeeds in her work so drastically that her male boss is threatened by her, and passes her over for a promotion until she proves her &#8220;stability&#8221; to him be being in a relationship.<br /><br />Cool.  Thanks, romance movies.<br /><br />In any case, nowdays it&#8217;s easier to stomach documentaries, particularly nature-related ones like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Planet">The Blue Planet</a>.  Which is amazing!  I can&#8217;t even imagine how they could have gotten some of this footage.<br /><br />The following are things that blew my mind the most.<br /><br /><br /><h3>There is life on earth that does not depend on the sun.</h3><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9Mt-1cxO72w/TmURm86YtoI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/pNVUZ_bmbr8/s1600/deepseavolcano.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="488" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9Mt-1cxO72w/TmURm86YtoI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/pNVUZ_bmbr8/s640/deepseavolcano.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a colony beyond sunlight</td></tr></tbody></table><br />White crabs, fish, 2-meter long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii_worm">Pompei worms</a>, and hundreds of other species live near underwater volcanic vents, completely independent from the sun.  Their survival instead depends on bacteria that can derive sulfides from the vent, and are to these creatures what plants are to us.  Volcanic vents like these are also often only active for a couple decades or so.<br /><br /><br /><h3>Shearwater birds can dive down to a depth of several meters.</h3><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uEs0yq0SkPM/TmUPzv9nenI/AAAAAAAAAbA/Khxv6vVLvJc/s1600/dolphinsandbirds.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="478" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uEs0yq0SkPM/TmUPzv9nenI/AAAAAAAAAbA/Khxv6vVLvJc/s640/dolphinsandbirds.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dolphins and shearwaters underwater</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I mean, puffins can dive as well but I guess I was just shocked to see birds and dolphins swimming and eating <em>together</em>.  In this part of the documentary, a school of mackerel were cornered from above by the shearwaters and from below by the dolphins, and then later were set upon by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowfin_tuna">yellowfin tuna</a> (i.e. albacore).<br /><br /><br /><h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_squid">Firefly squid</a> have photophores not only on their tentacles, but over their entire body.</h3><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F37c8zxsaOQ/TmUQ9RmhHQI/AAAAAAAAAbI/G4DNX-JI23k/s1600/fireflysquid.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="488" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F37c8zxsaOQ/TmUQ9RmhHQI/AAAAAAAAAbI/G4DNX-JI23k/s640/fireflysquid.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">pretty!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This was in the episode titled &#8220;The Deep&#8221; which in general was full of beautiful luminescent stuff, including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vM1KhgloUA">Sea Gooseberries</a>, which I saw for the first time at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.<br /><br /><br /><h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capelin">Capelin</a> fish lay their eggs on beaches.</h3><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xc2iwaQqZtU/TmUTyjIiANI/AAAAAAAAAbY/kZ3Fgwns7eU/s1600/fishfish.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="482" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xc2iwaQqZtU/TmUTyjIiANI/AAAAAAAAAbY/kZ3Fgwns7eU/s640/fishfish.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">omg so many of them</td></tr></tbody></table><br />At the end of June/early July, capelin beach themselves to lay and fertilize their eggs.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;ve spent most of the weekend playing hidden object games to try and understand them better.  The only one I&#8217;d been familiar with before was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Interactive#Nancy_Drew_Dossier"><em>Nancy Drew Dossier</em></a> series, which I&#8217;d hesitate to call a &#8220;hidden object game&#8221; because it feels like it contains more small puzzles than actual &#8220;hidden object scenes&#8221; where you&#8217;re given a I-Spy list of things to spot.  Then again, most hidden object games also have small puzzles, so the whole &#8220;hidden object&#8221; genre in general seems pretty fluid.  And I think I ended up playing some games which, like NDD, seem to be general puzzle-solving adventures.<br /><br />My intention in playing these was to investigate and note what I felt were good and bad design choices, and in general to try and get a grip of what people expect hidden object games to offer.  I played all the games for at least an hour.  Spoilers may follow.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Drawn: Dark Flight</h2><em>Drawn: Dark Flight</em> is the sequel to <em>Drawn: Painted Tower</em>, and the premise of the game is to light beacons in order to help a young woman become the Queen of Stonebriar.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GNFAGWpWiIM/TmVvGlWpz3I/AAAAAAAAAbo/HFuaZLF0Kis/s1600/29csw1y.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GNFAGWpWiIM/TmVvGlWpz3I/AAAAAAAAAbo/HFuaZLF0Kis/s320/29csw1y.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://luv-of-mylife.blogspot.com/2010/09/adventure-games-drawn-dark-flight.html">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><h3>Things I Liked:</h3><ul><li>The art is beautiful.  I&#8217;m a sucker for dust motes (which seem to be a common theme of most hidden object environments), and the mostly-somber painted style was also very beautiful to look at.</li><li>I like the subtlety of hints &#8211; for instance, the hint <em>You can climb up a paper-thin rope</em> cluing me into using the fact that I had to use my &#8220;Sketch of A Rope&#8221; object.  Haha it&#8217;s a dead giveaway, but better than a completely dead giveaway, you know?  You still feel kinda smart solving it.</li><li>The use of the &#8220;drawn stuff/paper/sketches&#8221; theme and the variety of puzzles yielded by it was also pretty cool.</li></ul><br /><h3>Things I Didn&#8217;t Like:</h3><ul><li>Whenever I try to navigate backwards, I keep accidentally hitting the inventory box at the bottom of the screen. This is because your inventory resides at the bottom of the screen, and also near the bottom of the screen is an invisible hitbox you click in order to navigate backward.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kq-05kOuSss/TmV-I_0nqhI/AAAAAAAAAcA/0sOM5n6ajaA/s1600/hitbox1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kq-05kOuSss/TmV-I_0nqhI/AAAAAAAAAcA/0sOM5n6ajaA/s320/hitbox1.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dang you, invisible hitbox</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This was an annoyance across most games that I played.  This is related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law">Fitts&#8217;s Law</a>, which is a model of human movement that basically says, <em>The bigger the button is, the easier it is to point at it.</em>  With computers, the edges and corners of a screen are easy to point at, because the mouse cursor remains at the edge or corner of a screen regardless of how much further you move it &#8211; thus, I personally found it annoying to want to move &#8220;back&#8221; and having to restrain myself from going all the way to the bottom of the screen.  I suspect (though do not know) that the act of moving backward is more common than looking at your inventory item, so I think that whole lower area of the screen should be reserved for navigation.</li><li>When you pick up an item, it goes straight to your inventory, and you don&#8217;t really have a chance to examine it, much less know what it is that you now have in your inventory.  Maybe it&#8217;s Zelda that&#8217;s made me feel like I should be rewarded/acknowledged every time I come into possession of something, but when you grab something and it spontaneously goes into your pocket before you&#8217;re even sure what it is, it feels a little forced.</li><li>Wait, so who am I again?  And why do I care about this girl I don&#8217;t know becoming the queen?  I know it&#8217;s a sequel but it would have been nice to have a little more intrigue. I didn&#8217;t play the entire game, though, so maybe there&#8217;s more interestingness in the plot later.</li></ul><br /><br /><br /><h2>Shiver: Vanishing Hitchhiker</h2>You pick up a hitch hiker.  As you drop her off in a small town, you realize she left something behind.  It&#8217;s a teddy bear&#8230;from your childhood!  This hidden object game has a horror/scary flavor to it.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AuKGZza-Myc/TmV1RuKrcTI/AAAAAAAAAbw/NGw9feKdBPQ/s1600/Shiver-Vanishing-Hitchhiker.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AuKGZza-Myc/TmV1RuKrcTI/AAAAAAAAAbw/NGw9feKdBPQ/s320/Shiver-Vanishing-Hitchhiker.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://www.downloadall.in/download-shiver-vanishing-hitchhiker-collectors-edition/shiver-vanishing-hitchhiker/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><h3>Things I Liked:</h3><ul><li>The hidden object scenes were slightly different &#8211; rather than just searching the scene, to find some objects, you had to manipulate the environment in some way.  For example, some objects would be hidden in a box you&#8217;d have to open, or you might have to put together a photograph&#8217;s torn edges in order to really &#8220;find&#8221; the photograph.</li><li>I liked the use of the flashlight to illuminate only some parts of a hidden object scene as you were searching, and also as a method of exploring the environment; at one point in the basement area my flashlight fell onto a bright-eyed rat and I jumped in my seat, haha.  Limiting a player&#8217;s view = good shock/scare value.</li><li>Speaking of good shock/scare values, this game did a good job with creepy things, for example that one hidden object scene where you had to find a hand, and the hand was a plastic doll&#8217;s hand in a meat grinder.</li><li>The environment would also move on its own sometimes, with shadows in the windows or eyes at the keyhole &#8211; cool stuff like that.</li><li>When I was trying to reconstruct steps in the basement and was failing, the main character himself said, &#8220;I have to go from the lowest step.&#8221; I like that the character himself said something, rather than the game putting up a dialog for me to follow &#8211; it&#8217;s a little more natural-feeling.  On the other hand, I guess this too can have <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ptitlez17dr6puup2l">its pitfalls</a>.</li><li>The story started becoming really, really intriguing after a while, and I really want to play more to see what&#8217;s actually happening in this strange little town!</li></ul><br /><h3>Things I Didn&#8217;t Like:</h3><ul><li>Again, objects that you picked up abruptly went into your inventory without announcement or examination.</li><li>And again with that &#8220;let&#8217;s reserve the bottom of the screen for the inventory&#8221; thing.</li><li>Something else this game does that seems common to hidden object games &#8211; <em>really</em> abrupt hidden object scenes.  Like, you approach a desk, and click it, and without warning there&#8217;s a list of objects at the bottom of the screen.  Huh?  No instruction?  Why do I specifically need to find <em>wrench, oil can, screwdriver, wood planar</em>?  At then at the end I suddenly get to keep the screwdriver?!  A lot of puzzles in hidden object games seem to throw you in without any instruction, but for a hidden object scene it&#8217;s a little weird, because you have the list at the bottom that is not strictly a part of or even in its entirety related to the &#8220;game world&#8221; at all.  I wonder players find this treatment of hidden object scenes pretty normal.  If they do, that is pretty interesting as an example of unspoken expectations between the players and the developers.  It would be like making a shooting game and not teaching the player how to use a gun.  Maybe there <em>are</em> games like this now.</li><li>I was also kind of sad there was so little opportunity to learn about the main character of the story, who (judging by the first scene of the game) was slightly psychic.  At the very least he wasn&#8217;t utterly freaked out by the appearance of ghosts later in the game, and when I hovered over his camera on the bottom-right side the tooltip said that it could see ghosts.  So&#8230;alright then.  My desire to learn more about the main character may have come about through playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright">Phoenix Wright</a>, and I wish you were able to &#8220;interact&#8221; with the main character to learn who he is, really.  Phoenix Wright is lovable because of his dryness, which is readily evident by what he thinks about the various things you choose to examine in different scenes of the game.  But especially with these hidden object games, you&#8217;re given such a richer-looking environment than what&#8217;s seen in a DS &#8211; why not interact with it a little more?</li><li>Without knowing more about who the character is, the premise of why he ventured into the village &#8211; to seek the girl who may be from his past &#8211; feels forced and weak.  What are the stakes here?  I think that there&#8217;s another <em>Shiver</em> game out there, but even if this is a sequel, it should be able to stand up on its own and explain itself.</li><li>At some point I couldn&#8217;t find some object and started clicking all over the screen randomly, and my cursor started spinning around of its own accord moved off the screen.  For a second I thought this was creep-factor stuff, but then later realized this was the game&#8217;s way of penalizing me for clicking around randomly.  In which case, a &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that or else I&#8217;ll make your cursor crazy&#8221; warning would have been nice.</li></ul><br /><br /><br /><h2>Tiger Eye: Curse of the Riddle Box Part 1</h2>A woman with an affinity for metal finds a shapeshifter man in a game that is based off a paranormal romance novel.  As a sidenote, this game was developed by <a href="http://passionfruitgames.com/download/">the people who developed NDD</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B6KKeIL0o9M/TmV9MvC8DaI/AAAAAAAAAb4/dDd3UwnhBMw/s1600/TigerEye-screenshot.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B6KKeIL0o9M/TmV9MvC8DaI/AAAAAAAAAb4/dDd3UwnhBMw/s320/TigerEye-screenshot.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://blog.libraryjournal.com/inthebookroom/2010/12/02/interactive-digital-romance-gets-its-game-on/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Things I Liked</h3><ul><li>The hidden object scenes were <em>related to what was going on in the story presently</em>.  Have a dream about metal weaponry?  Find metal weaponry in a Chinese dirt market!  Need to assemble a bike?  Find the bike parts in an alleyway!</li><li>The things that you find in scenes also correlate to puzzles &#8211; for example, collecting metal capsules which were then used in a word puzzle.</li><li>You have more hints than other games, and the number of hints you have is directly correlated with your actions, and if you don&#8217;t use hints you are rewarded (by bonus material at the end of the game).</li><li>If you click around too much, your cursor freezes and the game explains to you what you did that it didn&#8217;t like.</li><li>Good voice acting!</li><li>And pretty scenes!</li><li>The puzzles are very varied and fun to solve.</li><li>Bonus: I love when the thing that I&#8217;m searching for is <em>everywhere</em>!  For example, one scene where pieces of paper were strewn all over the room.  Collecting everything in sight is just a rush.  Maybe it&#8217;s the mad, doober-collecting player that Zynga has bred in me.</li><li>Super Bonus: A female protagonist who is like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait for the handyman, I&#8217;ll just fix the bathroom myself.&#8221;</li></ul><br /><h3>Things I Didn&#8217;t Like</h3><ul><li>The object you had to find were pretty small, even in full-screen mode.</li><li>Each puzzle that you had to complete had instructions telling you what to do on the bottom.  A lot of other hidden object games just throw you in.  The puzzles are simple enough that you can figure out what to do on your own, and if you are given the chance to figure out a puzzle from scratch, I think the sense of accomplishment is greater.  At the very least there&#8217;s less of a &#8220;hand-holding&#8221; feeling.  If you really need to give instructions, you could give the player a chance to ask for it via a hint.</li><li>A lot of these puzzles could have really used a &#8220;Restart&#8221; button.  Too often I messed around with pieces I had to assemble somehow, got completely confused, and then just wanted to start over fresh, without having to move all the pieces back out of the way myself.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j3QJTKzOuEk/TmWO_oaLnyI/AAAAAAAAAcI/_KZXCcyDlQI/s1600/tigereyepuzzle2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="241" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j3QJTKzOuEk/TmWO_oaLnyI/AAAAAAAAAcI/_KZXCcyDlQI/s320/tigereyepuzzle2.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">okay&#8230;I just want to start over</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li>I also wish there had been an ability to exit a puzzle I was stuck at to take a break and check out another puzzle for a while.</li><li>Also, though there&#8217;s a row of puzzle hints you can use at the top of the puzzle (visible in the above screenshot), they were unresponsive to clicking.  And though the number of hints I had was still visible in its usual place in the bottom-right, I couldn&#8217;t use them.  Confusing.</li></ul><br /><br /><br /><h2>Mystery Legends: The Phantom of the Opera</h2>It&#8217;s based off Phantom of the Opera.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Iz93vPSUv7g/TmWSCNv-TLI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/_l1Gukesrpc/s1600/Mystery-Legends-The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-the-phantom-of-the-opera-17346742-1280-800.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Iz93vPSUv7g/TmWSCNv-TLI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/_l1Gukesrpc/s320/Mystery-Legends-The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-the-phantom-of-the-opera-17346742-1280-800.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://www.fanpop.com/spots/the-phantom-of-the-opera/images/17346742/title/mystery-legends-phantom-opera-wallpaper">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><h3>Things I Liked</h3><ul><li>Again, gorgeous art.  DUST MOTES.  YES.  There were also small moving elements I liked, like little spiders everywhere.  But again, I wish I&#8217;d been able to get a rise out of the main character by clicking them.  Is she afraid of spiders?  Is she not?  I&#8217;ll never know.</li><li>Good tutorial for how to navigate, and I also like that navigational arrows are labeled with where you&#8217;ll go should you decide to click.  It&#8217;s especially useful for this game because there are <em>so many places.  The map is also helpful in marking the rooms that have something of note in them.</em></li><li>When you find things, they vanish, and sometimes what&#8217;s left behind is creepy!  Like this one mannequin had a helmet, and when you found the helmet it revealed this rather disturbed-looking head.  That is a really good use of that mechanic.</li><li>The inventory at the bottom of the screen is hidden a little better.</li><li>I like the mysterious hints that you pick up, i.e. the Green Faerie Absinthe Recipe.  Pretty fantastical.  Didn&#8217;t play far enough to see whether this really played into the story well (other than it being a recipe for something you need to collect items to make).</li><li>Bonus: There&#8217;s a reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_play"><em>Wicked</em></a>!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6pObbsr44wo/TmWkuF9r-dI/AAAAAAAAAcw/qP404sB3mmQ/s1600/phantom.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6pObbsr44wo/TmWkuF9r-dI/AAAAAAAAAcw/qP404sB3mmQ/s320/phantom.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">can you find it?!</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li></ul><br /><h3>Things I Didn&#8217;t Like</h3><ul><li>I would have wanted more opportunity to examine things, and more narration to help me learn more about the protagonist, etc.</li><li>There were so many&#8230;<i>places</i>, haha. &nbsp;Maybe I&#8217;ve become too casual for my own good.</li></ul><br /><br /><br /><h2>Mystery Case Files: Ravenhearst</h2>The Queen of England has enlisted your help in investigating a haunted manor.  You uncover what mysterious and terrible things happened therein by collecting the pages of a woman&#8217;s diary.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HXL6hsDpM-E/TmWf3t-mxFI/AAAAAAAAAcg/su4x2AV3_wI/s1600/post-45137-1181170982.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HXL6hsDpM-E/TmWf3t-mxFI/AAAAAAAAAcg/su4x2AV3_wI/s320/post-45137-1181170982.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://www.macclubindonesia.com/forums/showthread.php?11136-Mystery-Case-Files-Ravenhearst">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><h3>Things I Liked</h3><ul><li>To actually collect the diary entries, you have to piece them together, which turns out to be unexpectedly challenging. o__o<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yMGgVv_HvCs/TmWfsoSKvDI/AAAAAAAAAcY/CU3hA9YlCNA/s1600/ravenhearst%2Bpuzzle.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yMGgVv_HvCs/TmWfsoSKvDI/AAAAAAAAAcY/CU3hA9YlCNA/s320/ravenhearst%2Bpuzzle.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the answer is so close, yet so far</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li>I liked the whispers in the background &#8211; occasionally you&#8217;d hear a <em>Help me</em> or <em>This place is evil!</em> whispered alongside the background music.  &#8220;This place is evil&#8221; seems a little corny but I still appreciated it, haha.  Audio mechanics, though, remind me of accessibility &#8211; a game that relied more heavily on sound effects as part of the plot would be inaccessible to the deaf.  It also makes me think of how sound does not matter with many Flash games, since people play them at work with the sound turned down.  How often do people play hidden object games with the sound up?  You <em>could</em> potentially play games like these in small intervals on work breaks.</li><li>Stuff in the background changes subtly &#8211; for example, clicking on a painting of a woman may change her face very subtly into a skull.  Once I clicked on a card and it  tore in half, revealing a scrawled red <em>HELP</em>.  This is what I mean when I say I like interacting with the environment more. :D Plus, this is how you can contribute and really strengthen your theme.</li><li>This game has a pretty cool type of puzzle where you come up against a door which is locked with a completely bizarre-looking mechanism.  No instructions &#8211; just figure it out.  &#8220;Click everything!&#8221;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uyRFO3xFd38/TmWiJ3mhxPI/AAAAAAAAAco/LYrYRx709fo/s1600/ravenhearst%2Bpuzzle2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uyRFO3xFd38/TmWiJ3mhxPI/AAAAAAAAAco/LYrYRx709fo/s320/ravenhearst%2Bpuzzle2.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">just, GO!</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li>Clicking stuff at random reveals a help dialog!</li></ul><br /><h3>Things I Didn&#8217;t Like</h3><ul><li>Clicking stuff at random, after the help dialog shows up, gives you a dialog that you shouldn&#8217;t do that, and then punishes you by removing around a minute of the time you&#8217;re given to solve a &#8220;level.&#8221; What!  I can&#8217;t just have a warning at first?</li><li>When you click on something in a hidden object scene that is not on your I-Spy list, there&#8217;s this&#8230;really abrasive noise.  Which I guess deters you from clicking at random, but&#8230;man.  That noise is unpleasant.</li><li>There were small wording issues that I didn&#8217;t like&#8230;when my list told me to find a &#8220;squash&#8221; it really meant find a &#8220;kabocha,&#8221; and when it asked me to find a &#8220;shovel&#8221; it really wanted me to find a garden spade looking thing.  (Then, later, it asked me to find a &#8220;spade&#8221; which was an object that looked exactly like a &#8220;shovel&#8221;!) It&#8217;s a pretty small issue but it brings to mind the problem with choosing hidden objects to be things that everyone will be able to figure out.  I guess if you&#8217;re downloading this game from Big Fish it can be pretty assumed you have the internet to Google Image <em>wood planar</em>, so perhaps this is a trivial issue.</li><li>On a related note, one of the puzzles required me to play music on a piano keyboard, which would have stopped me in my tracks if I didn&#8217;t know how to read music or play the piano.  One thing I like about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Interactive"><em>Nancy Drew Adventure</em></a> games is that if you will need some sort of knowledge to solve a puzzle, the game will provide it for you, for example in a book somewhere.  Then again, NDA is a game that could be purchased and installed from a store (i.e. no internet required), whereas these games are downloaded, so, maybe it&#8217;s a trivial issue again.</li><li>The phrase &#8220;Hidden Clues Remaining&#8221; at the bottom-right &#8211; I thought this meant the number of hints I had left overall, but it was actually the number of hidden things I had to find before I could unlock a diary page to piece together.  I don&#8217;t remember the game explaining that, though.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Still not a casual game pro, but definitely getting more intrigued by them. &nbsp;It seems like a good area for building strong stories in an industry that otherwise doesn&#8217;t seem like it has the time for them. &nbsp;Though recently I watched the gameplay trailer for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_(video_game)">Bastion</a> and was pretty impressed and happy at how the game is narrated.</div><br /><center><iframe width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VZAuKkv4eZE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></div>
